# Summary

The purpose of Balancer’s locked vlAura should be to augment our successful revenue driving pools while also giving us the flexibility to target particular narrative strategies so that we are able to compete with protocols that have a centralized emissions direction framework.  

Balancer DAO currently has 1,423,058.93 vlAura as a result of BIP-481 https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-481-claim-and-lock-balancer-dao-aura-allocation-into-vlaura/5319
This represents about 5.74% of vlAura voting weight and represents 2-3% of total veBAL votes.  

I propose we utilize this voting power to forward the strategic initiatives of the Balancer DAO according to the following framework.

**40% Revenue Producing Pools**
**40% Facilitating Core Liquidity**
**20% Discretionary Business Development**

### Revenue Producing Pools (40%)


40% of the vlAura will be used to vote for sustainable revenue producing pools.  We define a sustainable revenue producing pool as a pool with predictable revenue production that does not depend on volatility to earn protocol revenue. This would be inclusive of major LST stableswap pools with fee on yield (Lido stETH, rocketpool rETH, frax sfrxETH) and pools with >=50% composition of major interest bearing stablecoin pools (sDAI, sFRAX).  

The allocation strategy will be simple, first we will designate a list of pools to be considered as “core revenue producing pools” which align with the composition described above. This vote weight will be distributed pro-rata according to the revenue earned relative to other core revenue producing pools.  So if pool A earns 30k, pool B earns 10k, and pool C earns 20k, the vote weight distribution will be 50,16.6, 33.3.  In order to simplify voting and minimize dust amounts, we will initially restrict this to the top 6 pools.  

These pools should not be used to further business development efforts and should solely be utilized to promote DAO revenue.  


### Facilitating Core Liquidity/Bootstrapping (40%)

A very important part about being a multichain dex is ensuring there is enough core liquidity to facilitate routing through the most important major assets such as WETH and USDC.  Having a Stablecoin<->WETH route allows us to structure liquidity in a way that allows us to route to nearly any asset, assuming there is liquidity connecting them.  The issue with a pool like WETH/USDC weighted is that there is very little incentive for veBAL or vlAura holders to allocate vote weight towards as there are no external incentives and are purely fueled by core pool bribes. Having this vote weight will allow us to spin up liquidity that is strategically important for routing and future revenue potential without relying on philanthropic veBAL voters to vote for it.  Note that there may be some overlap between revenue producing pools and core liquidity, especially as LST’s and sDAI/sFRAX grow their presence on L2’s. 
In the interest of getting this initiative live in a timely fashion, this allocation will have some discretionary components initially but a transparent objective methodology will be put into place.  

### Discretionary Business Development (20%)

This portion of vlAura should be used to vote for strategic partner initiatives that are likely to grow beyond the initial vote weight we assign.  In the modern dex landscape we are competing against projects that have an entirely centralized emissions allocation strategy and this gives them the ability to be nimble in regards to bootstrapping narratives.  We hope that this vote weight will help attract important partners to build their liquidity on Balancer for the long-term by giving an initial boost needed to bootstrap. 
These vlAura votes should not be used to sustain any particular BD initiatives for over 6 weeks and will fall back on revenue producing pools should there be no current BD initiatives. 

#### Miscellaneous:
There is no easy way to automate vlAura voting on chain because it uses offchain snapshot voting.  vlAura also requires submitting votes for every biweekly period, and there’s no ability to “lock in” votes to roll over epoch to epoch.  This means that there will have to be some entity capable of executing on vlAura votes.  We propose that we delegate our vlAura voting power to a Maxi controlled multisig that will then be used to vote according to the above criteria.  All allocations and methodology will be posted on github which will be used as the data source for submitting votes. 

Additionally, Balancer will recycle 70% of bribes collected back into vote incentives on the that generated them.  30% will be sent to the DAO treasury as USDC.

This is a living framework and can be refined in the future to better suit the ongoing needs of the protocol, subject to a governance vote. 

No project can request vote weight as part of their gauge proposal/governance vote.  

### Specification:

Balancer DAO multisig() on mainnet `will:
1.  call the `delegate(address)` function on the vlAura locking contract `0x3fa73f1e5d8a792c80f426fc8f84fbf7ce9bbcac` with the parameter newDelegatee set to `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e`
2. call the `setRewardForwarding(address)` function on the hidden hands BribeVault `0xE00fe722e5bE7ad45b1A16066E431E47Df476CeC` with the parameter setRewardForwarding set to `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e`

`0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e` is a new vlAURA voting multisig deployed across all chains on which Balancer operates.  It requires 3/7 Maxi Signers to sign, with @gosuto being added as the 7th signer.  Details about the setup of this multisig can be found [HERE](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/pull/163).  This multisig is hereby granted the mandate and authorization to:

1. Vote with it's delegated vlAURA in accordance to the guidelines proposed above.
2. Claim all earned vote incentives, sell them for USDC, bridge them to mainnet, and process the proceeds in accordance with the guidelines laid out above:
   -  30% to Treasury `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`
   - 70% recycled as new vote incentives (potentially via the multisig handling core pools incentives to save on gas)",neutral
1,"The M-Token team proposes adding a [MBTC, [sBTC pool]] Metapool. Adding a MBTC pool will further increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum and make it easier to swap between assets.

Hello everyone,

We are M-Token team. Today, we would like to introduce M-Tokens, and initiate the proposal to add the MBTC Metapool on the Curve platform.
First of all, MBTC is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum issued by M-Tokens on a 1:1 basis peg to actual Bitcoin. This enables seamless integration of crypto assets on other blockchains into the Ethereum ecosystem and brings the community another choice to enjoy the cross-chain transaction with convenience, transparency, and value.

All M-Tokens reserves are safeguarded by qualified custodians. At the current stage, M-Token is supported by Cactus Custody, who manages private keys in the industry high-level HSMs and its proprietary multi-tiered storage system by the tier-4 grade data centers across three continents. Its segregation of duty and zero-trust system design can guarantee the safety and availability of the assets without dependency on any single individual. Meanwhile, a multi-signature mechanism is adopted by M-Tokens for its crucial aspects such as mining and burning, allowing on-the-chain verification. Thus, it provides cross-chain asset services that are both transparent and reliable. Major parties taking part in M-Tokens include the governing bodies, custodians, merchants, and the end users.

In terms of technical aspects, smart contact and hash mapping are adopted. Simultaneously, the reserve deposit addresses, outstanding balances, and transaction records are made 100% public and traceable to enable exact cross-chain mapping. In terms of governance, checks and balances are achieved through a multi-institutional framework, roles/rights segregation, and decentralization, facilitating the prevention of malice committed by any individual or entity. Moreover, the blacklisting mechanism lays a foundation for ongoing governance and regulatory compliance.

M-Token has currently collaborated with SynFutures protocol, where its users can use MBTC to trade the derivatives product on the platform. M-Token has also partnered with Matrixport on industry-leading crypto financial solutions, which will empower M-Token with the capacity of yield generating in the future. Most importantly, the capability to conduct structural products and become a gateway between DeFi and CeFi will be the parts we focus on, and it definitely is our unique advantage.

We believe that adding the MBTC pool will increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum, and enable the BTC holders invest their assets into Ethereum projects in a convenient, speedy and cost-effective manner.

Audits Security Reviews:
M-Tokens & MBTC has been audited by Peckshield. 

MBTC Market Cap: [Will be updated]
Currently, MBTC total supply is “200”.

Yes, you read that right! Today we’re switching things up and announcing our intention to host a reverse Syrup Pool in which you can stake BEP20 AXS to earn CAKE tokens!

# Why AXS? 

Raise your hands if you’ve played Axie Infinity!!! As one of the hottest blockchain games currently, Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired digital pet universe built on the Ethereum blockchain where anyone can earn token rewards through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem.

As of today, AXS is now live on Binance Smart Chain and we wanted to celebrate this with a reverse Syrup Pool!


# The Syrup Pool:
Stake AXS tokens to earn CAKE tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 8,000 CAKE (Approx. $50K worth)
- **Distribution duration:** 7 days
- **Start block:** 9231500 (approx. 9am UTC on July 17th)
- **Finish block:** 9433100 (approx. 9am UTC on July 24th)
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.03968 CAKE


## Max Stake per wallet: 
20 AXS (approx. $440) 


# The Farm:
In addition to the Syrup Pool, we are hosting an AXS-BNB farm that will have 2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours and then 1x CAKE rewards after that. Remember, liquidity means less slippage, more trading and more CAKE burned as a result!


# What is Axie Infinity?

Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired digital pet universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets (known as Axies). Currently, players can start the game by purchasing Axies from other players on the Marketplace.

All in-game assets and Axie-related data can be accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe.

The project team aims to build a platform that encompasses the characteristics of a social network and jobs platform by creating a strong community and play-to-earn opportunities.

* Pool Address: https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x48607651416a943bf5ac71c41be1420538e78f87000200000000000000000327
* Official Channels: www.linktr.ee/SiloFinance

**Protocol Description**

Silo is a lending market that allows users to lend and borrow any asset in a risk-isolated way through the use of a bridge asset design. Our largest liquidity pool sits in the SILO:FRAX Curve Factory pool. The pool is incentivized with ~130k protocol-owned vlCVX (half of SiloDAO ~260k holdings).

Token holders currently passed a [proposal](https://snapshot.silo.finance/#/proposal/0xa656fc504f1ceb46239f8b24a2736b33231b6e830bbb528947838248d7f785e4) to allocate ~130k vlCVX to incentivize SILO:ETH Balancer pool. The core team will use ~130k vlCVX to collect bribes, sell them, and use proceeds to bribe veBAL holders.

**Motivation**

SiloDAO originally purchased ~260k CVX with the intention of max-locking and directing $CRV and $CVX emissions to the SILO:FRAX v2 gauge. The solution has fallen short of the community’s expectation for a few reasons:

* Despite high APY (~130% at peak), we were only able to attract a modest amount of liquidity resulting in high slippage.
* The stablecoin (Frax) pairing may have discouraged LPs from depositing despite high APY.
* Curve factory pools are not mostly read by price aggregators (e.g. CoinMarketcap) or routed through by DEX aggregators (e.g. 1inch).

Activating a gauge for the SILO:ETH Balancer pool will allow SiloDAO to build a primary source of liquidity for our token by incentivizing liquidity. We believe Balancer is far more widely integrated by price and DEX aggregators which makes it a more convenient option. The ETH pairing as opposed to stablecoin exposes LPs to lower IL. Last but not least, once ignited, the Silo’s Tokemak reactor can direct liquidity to the Balancer pool once the integration between the two protocols happens.

**Specifications**

1. Governance: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.

Silo is operated as a DAO and governance decisions are completely decentralized. Holders can create proposals, create snapshot votes to gauge temperature, and vote on Tally for on-chain decisions.

2. Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

Silo lending protocol currently uses Uniswap v3 and Balancer v2 oracles in order to read asset prices. This is required to gauge lending parameters such as LTV and Health Factors to allow liquidation of undercollateralized positions.

3. Audits: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

Our audit reports from ABDK and Quantstamp as well as a Certora Formal Verification Report can be found here 

4. Centralization vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

No, token holders fully control both the DAO and its lending contracts. 

5. Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume?

Our Balancer pool is https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x48607651416a943bf5ac71c41be1420538e78f87000200000000000000000327. It had at most $50k TVL whilst the majority of our liquidity was on Uniswap v3 and Curve v2 although we aim to make Balancer our primary liquidity pool through incentives. $SILO is an unpegged asset and has faced similar price volatility as other assets, experiencing significant upward price action with the tail-end of the bull-market in April 2022 before crashing a significant amount with the recent downtrend.

6. Value: Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)

Our Balancer SILO:ETH pool will be incentivized with an equal value of bribes as our SILO:FRAX pool on Curve v2 (both will receive ~130k vlCVX in votes or bribe-equivalents). Given our protocol had just launched to the public this week, we expect trading volume to pick up rapidly as our token gains utility.

We will reassess the value of bribes:liquidity between SILO:ETH on Balancer and SILO:FRAX on Curve v2 and will happily add more incentives to Balancer if it is shown to be cost-effective.

Note: Please ensure the owner of your pool on Ethereum is set to 0xba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1b If this is not done, please clearly explain why in your proposal.

4,"Rationale: AAVE's flash loan fees are not competitive with newer offerings on the market, and represent roughly 1% of protocol revenue. This revenue continues to steadily decline as more users switch to offerings like dYdX's free flashloans and Maker's new flash minting. AAVE governance should make a choice on whether to adapt to these changing conditions.

Proposal: Set flash loan fees to zero. This would essentially mean that the liquidity of AAVE would be available to all users with zero friction. The drawback is the loss of flash loan fees for depositors. Reducing flash loan fees is also an option, but there's no telling how long any new rate would stay competitive.

title: [ARFC] Safety Module - Polygon & Avalanche Coverage Update
author: @TokenLogic
created: 2023-09-03

---

# Summary

This publication proposes updating the Safety Module (SM) coverage across the various iterations of Aave Protocol on Polygon and Avalanche networks.

SM coverage is to be removed from Polygon v2 and Avalanche v2 deployments and extended to Avalanche v3.

# Motivation

With the continued migration of users from v2 to v3, this publication seeks to further encourage users to migrate by removing the SM coverage for Aave v2 deployments on the Polygon and Avalanche networks.

During 2023, the total market size on Avalanche and Polygon Aave v2 Protocol deployments has been trending lower. At the time of writing the total market size of Aave v2 on Avalanche and Polygon is $36.2M and $134.7M respectively. For comparison, the Aave v3 deployment on each network is $199.8M and $229.9M respectively. 

By removing SM coverage for Avalanche and Polygon v2 deployments, Aave DAO will no longer be providing coverage for the outdated iterations of Aave Protocol with exception of the Aave ARC deployment. By removing the SM coverage, users are further encouraged to migrate to v3.

The Polygon Aave v3 deployment is already covered by the SM whilst the Avalanche v3 deployment is not cover by the SM. This publication seeks to extend the SM coverage to include Avalanche v3. Therefore both v3 iterations are covered by the SM and v2 iterations are not covered on Polygon and Avalanche. 

For reference, at the time of writing, the following Aave Protocol deployments are covered by the SM:

* Ethereum v2
* [Ethereum v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2cbfeb5c5329c4d1720dbae4045386fceb2d2a9bd5b42a81cee47ea5c934f491)
* [Polygon v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7da4985b2d5b1cbe6bbc0992d5c86030cedef2013487e4b53b4244c315c90155)
* [Avalanche v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreiba2pdfwoesezgpedf37bjfgadxmaigavoulek5wayqb7f2tz6byy)
* [Aave ARC](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreieeyh6pbqwhgryo6v67oxlmnfhaptrgkc3u7y6bvz2y3jdkxgrrh4)
* [Polygon v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7da4985b2d5b1cbe6bbc0992d5c86030cedef2013487e4b53b4244c315c90155)


# Specification

It is important to note based upon the current implementation of the SM, an adhoc AIP is required to implement a Shortfall Event.

The following Snapshot votes will be created to enable granular voting:

* Extend SM Coverage to Avalanche v3
* Remove SM Coverage for Polygon v2
* Remove SM Coverage for Avalanche v2

Upon conclusion of the Snapshot vote, if approved, SM coverage will be removed/extended to the respective market.

There is no need for an AIP to implement this upgrade.

title: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding

created: 2024-02-29

# Summary

This publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee with 500k GHO to continue supporting GHO's liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next 3 months.

# Motivation

Since its initial [funding in October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/343/), the Aave Liquidity Committee (previously GLC) has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes by deploying and incentivising liquidity pools.
 
As a result of these efforts:

* Deeper on-chain liquidity
* Lower slippage, especially for GHO to USDC swaps

In combination with other efforts like stkGHO, ALC's initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHO's peg recovery.

Throughout the period, the ALC leveraged on both Uniswap v3 and, more frequently, Maverick to tailor liquidity distribution at specific price ranges which helped absorb GHO downward market volatility. A list of active Boosted Positions can be found [here](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions?chain=1).

While some pools are incentivised by voting with pre-existing DAO holdings (e.g. vlAURA), others like Maverick's concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses. It is worth noting, the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick. We expect Maverick, and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3, to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience.

Concentrated GHO liquidity was [recently introduced in Balancer](https://twitter.com/GyroStable/status/1757365157917815001) with the creation of several E-CLP pools. These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAO's vlAURA holding. When there is excess vlAURA votes, these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70% APR nominated in USDC. 

The following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHO's ecosystem, highlights:

* GHO/USDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume 
    * 0.2% bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period
    * 0.1% bin width pool is starting to replace the 0.2% bin width pool trading volume. This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 0.1% bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility 
*  GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP
    *  Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by [other protocols](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Graham_/status/1762076544241955070) and leveraged farming is introduced
* Gyrsocope E-CLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks
    *  As the peg improves, one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg

The next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas:

* 1.00:1.00 peg with USD 
* Reducing price volatility
* Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations
* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools
* Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases

These efforts will need to scale to match GHO's expected growth profile. The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins, and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future, as well as participation in the launch of various projects like [Ethena](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and [f(x) Protocol's launch](https://x.com/protocol_fx/status/1762822716854354015?s=20). 

Though there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates, price volatility, and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations, we believe a high-level budget will look like the following:

| Objective | Category | Budget   |
| --------  | --------  | -------- |
| Liquidity | Peg Resilience | 360k GHO |
| DeFi Integrations  | Create Utility  |  140k GHO |
|Total| | 500k GHO|

It is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum.

# Performance Indicators

The below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking:

| Description| Optimal Value|
| --------  | --------  |
| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M |
| TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools  | 15M excl. stkGHO  |
| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |

16,"# **PROPOSAL SUMMARY**

The current locked staking pool for PancakeSwap's native token, CAKE, has been a widely unaddressed disaster to the ecosystem, pooling and exacerbating the eventual inflationary dumps of CAKE.

 The lack of flexibility and limited incentives have resulted in less stable token prices and decreased user engagement. To address this issue, we propose the retirement of the locked pool follwed by implementation of a new flexible pool that combines the various syrup pools and platform revenue share, providing users with an all in one inclusive staking opportunity and greater control over their investment. 

This change would incentivize long-term holding, reduce CAKE emissions whilst providing a higher APR and increase engagement and confidence on the platform, ultimately resulting in a more stable token price and increased overall value for PancakeSwap and its users.


As the recent tokenomics discussion propsal seemed to be split between both extemes of the community, we present this solution as a middleground alternative.


# **HOW DOES IT WORK?**
The new all-in-one pool for PancakeSwap will combine all available syrup pool rewards, a portion of the current CAKE emissions, and a percentage of the revenue earned on the platform into a single flexible staking pool. By pooling these resources, the new staking offer will allow more diverse and attractive APR returns to users, while reducing the overall emission of CAKE. 

The lost APR from the reduction in CAKE emissions will be substituted with other project tokens and stable coin earnings from the platform's revenue. This will not only return user confidence and incentivize users to hold their assets in the new pool for longer periods, but also promote the growth and development of other projects on the platform. Overall, the new all-in-one pool will offer greater flexibility and control for users, while also promoting the long-term sustainability and success of PancakeSwap.

Further, by substituting and combining multiple rewards sources into one, we can mitigate the effects of CAKE being dumped, instead users will seek to sell their syrup and stable rewards to buy more CAKE to continue staking.

We recommend that CAKE earnt should be auto-compounded, however the syrup rewards and stable coins must be claimed and do not attribute to users staked amount.

Allowing this flexible all in one model to take the place of our current model would be crucial to a sustainable and attractive staking mechanism on PancakeSwap. 


# **HOW WILL THIS EFFECT PRICE?**
The implementation of the new all-in-one pool for PancakeSwap will have a positive effect on the overall price of the CAKE token. 

By reducing the actual CAKE emissions and substituting them with other project tokens and stable coin earnings from the platform's revenue, the new pool will help move PancakeSwap towards a deflationary model, promoting scarcity and attractiveness to increase the value of the token over time. 

Additionally, the flexibility of the all-in-one pool, which allows users to easily move their staked assets between different opportunities such as IFO's and trading competitions, this will drive more investors to participate freely in the pool, resulting in increased demand for CAKE and ultimately leading to an increase in its price. 

Overall, the new pool will provide a more attractive and sustainable investment opportunity for users, while also promoting the long-term growth and success of PancakeSwap.

# **WHAT OTHER STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN?**
As part of a pro-active move towards an ultra-sound cake, we feel that the best way to achieve this whilst also remaining attractive to investors is to develop further utilities and burn mechanisms.

We also recommend that the allocated buyback and burn fund be increased whilst the price of CAKE is tanking, to increase its overall beneficial impact and effectiveness.",bearish

# Summary

Request the BalancerDAO to update the Zodiac Roles Modifier permissions granted to the Manager SAFE owned by karpatkey to allow for: 
* Improving swap efficiency using alternative routes on Uniswap.
* Increasing liquidity on the WBTC-WETH pool on Uniswap v3 with NFT ID 430246.
* Implementing a more detailed scoping of swaps in Balancer pools.

*Note: reviewing and providing feedback on the preset update payload would be a great service to the Balancer community. We welcome anyone who is willing to take the time to verify the content and encourage community members to share their feedback with us.*


# Motivation

Per [BIP-103](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xddc174b931a0d2e5e32276a3d0d7110367797dd24248f078d0f7876d0987c92f), karpatkey has been tasked with deploying yield-generating strategies using a portion of the existing funds in the treasury in a risk-adjusted, trust-minimised, and non-custodial manner.

A new SAFE owned by the BalancerDAO was created, a Manager preset was applied to allow a specific subset of transactions and the in-scope funds were transferred. More details can be found in [this post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-162-karpatkey-investment-strategy/4220/11?u=santinomics). Since February, karpatkey has been managing the treasury portfolio, and [weekly reports](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386) are published on the forum. 

As we anticipated, the permissions preset is an evolving configuration that needs to be adjusted regularly. In this first update request, we are looking to fulfill the following objectives:

* To further improve the efficiency of the swaps, we request the BalancerDAO to introduce new permissions to the preset allowing swapping on Uniswap v3 using the ```exactInputSingle``` function, which is expected to provide alternative swapping routes that will yield better results.

* Additionally, a new permission to increase liquidity on the existing WBTC-WETH pool on Uniswap v3 with [NFT ID 430246](https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool/430246) is necessary. This is because, when configuring the permissions for the first time, a different position on the pool was created ([NFT ID 418522](https://app.uniswap.org/#/pools/418522)). However, at the time of deploying the funds into the pool, the position was out of range. Therefore, a new position was created but the ```increaseLiquidity``` function has never been whitelisted until now.

* Lastly, we request adjustments to the swap function on the Balancer Vault contract to implement a more detailed scoping of swaps, which will allow for a more robust and secure swapping process.

A new version of the [_“Preset permissions - Balancer”_ document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XKHGuPr6omIA1e10jfZg0IMYtNu0mfnHtbInPBMEsYY/edit?usp=sharing) that lists all the permissions applied to the Manager preset (including the ones being requested now) has been created. In this v2, the requested permissions are clearly highlighted as updates.


# Specification

This proposal is expected to be voted on Snapshot, and upon successful passing, the Safe multisig holding the in-scope assets will execute the following payload. Please note that the payload only contains the changes between the deployed version and the new one. The BalancerDAO multisig owners will receive a .json file with the payload, which can be executed through the Transaction Builder app on the SAFE environment. To keep this post concise, an explanation of the requested actions is provided in this accompanying [file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Efr2mM8kV13xvY2uaEv0r9Brm_-9BM2ywiV4976a8-s/edit?usp=sharing).

This AIP proposes the re-evaluation of Special Council salaries from [AIP-1 ](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-1-proposing-the-dao-process/39) with an immediate salary adjustment for future Special Council members, suggesting a 50% reduction in their compensation (from $20,833 of ApeCoin/month to $10,417 of ApeCoin/month). This adjustment will be applicable to all future terms as detailed in [AIP-137 ](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-137-the-special-council-nomination-process/8849) and [AIP-138](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-138-the-special-council-election-process/8850), exclusively affecting Special Council members elected after the implementation of this proposal.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

Financially, the DAO stands to accrue savings of up to $104,165 ApeCoin monthly. It will also elevate community engagement by granting ApeCoin holders the opportunity to vote on this delicate matter, enhancing the overall governance.

#### OVERALL COST

$0. No costs for the ApeCoin DAO. Instead it will save the DAO up to $104,165 ApeCoin/month.

21,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes STEPN ($GMT) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with STEPN! STEPN is a Web3 lifestyle app with Social-Fi and Game-Fi elements. Users, equipped with NFT Sneakers, walk, jog or run outdoors to earn Green Metaverse Tokens (GMT) and Green Satoshi Tokens (GST) via the protocol’s dual-token system.

Players can choose to lease or sell their NFT Sneakers from the in-app marketplace, with users’ earnings stored in the in-app wallet, which has a built-in Swap function.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $GMT tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 8,000,000 GMT
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Soon after BEP-20 GMT token withdrawals on Binance are enabled
 - **Token rewards per block:** 4.629 GMT 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the $GMT Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a GMT-USDC farm. The farm will have 2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 1x rewards after that. 

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the farm period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.

#### What is $GMT?

From the team: “GMT is the native governance token of STEPN with a total supply of 6 billion tokens and has the following use cases:

Governance: Stake to participate in governance, the longer the locking period, the higher the voting power.

Profit distribution: GMT holders own the treasury and can vote to decide the distribution of net profit.

Accrual of protocol revenue: GMT is burned to access in-app features, such as sneaker upgrades and minting.”

After the vote against AIP-4&5, the community had meaningful discussions on the ApeCoin DAO forum and elsewhere. The essential feedback was that overall the framework was fine, but lacked the key element of caps.

This AIP proposes a staking system for ApeCoin and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT ecosystem: Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC). Staking participants will be able to stake ApeCoin and use the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem NFTs to receive ApeCoin from a preset pool over a set period of time.

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Launch Aave V3 on Kava EVM 

Author: [Various Kava Ecosystem Contributors]

Created: 2023-12-12

---

# Summary

KAVA in collaboration with PGov and Michigan Blockchain propose the integration of Aave V3 with KAVA. KAVA’s EVM compatibility and integration will be a crucial advancement for the Aave multichain vision. The integration will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Cosmos and enables Cosmos ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through KAVA

# Motivation

This proposal aims to be a starting point in the process of bringing Aave to the KAVA Ecosystem and aims to provide necessary details to the Aave community to consider the merits of KAVA integration. Kava has been building out the cornerstones of a solid DeFi ecosystem since mainnet launch in 2022. The key dexes in the ecosystem are Kinetix (a Uniswap v3 dex plus perpetual trading platform built by the Quickswap team from Polygon), WAGMI (protocol owned liquidity dex), and Equilibre (a ve3,3 dex). There are a few burgeoning lending protocols on the chain, but with the team’s plans to deprecate the existing leading lending protocol on the Cosmos SDK side, Kava Lend, there exists an incredible opportunity for a blue chip lending protocol like Aave to establish market dominance on the EVM side.

In addition to the market opportunity, the Kava ecosystem has an ongoing incentive program called the Kava Rise program which incentivizes protocol usage pro-rata based on TVL per protocol. Currently 1M Kava is being distributed per month to protocols pro-rata. Due to the proclivity for lending protocols to attract a significant portion of TVL in an ecosystem, Aave stands to earn the majority of these rewards. The current distribution of rewards is 1M Kava per month, and can increase pending governance approval as the ecosystem matures.

The Kava Foundation has committed to providing liquidity mining rewards of a minimum of 1M Kava guaranteed over the first year for the Aave community.

*Benefits of deploying on Kava*

With the KAVA integration, Aave gets additional markets with Market Cap of $740M, ~200M of locked liquidity, native assets like ATOM, USDT, WBTC and more. KAVA itself is connected well within the Cosmos ecosystem, thus the integration will also enable the cosmos community to plug its deep $60Bn liquidity to Aave through KAVA.

- Kava today is the 12th largest chain by TVL, and 9th by number of deployed protocols as per DefiLlama 2
- Kava is an EVM built on top of the Cosmos SDK, this also facilitates bringing Cosmos assets (like ATOM) natively onto the Protocol, which is not possible on other EVMs. AAVE has the opportunity to connect trading in the Cosmos and Ethereum.
- Kava is the largest of such an EVM chain with native Cosmos integration capabilities.

*Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment*

In addition, Kava has recently garnered a partnership with Tether, as Tether selected Kava to be the native USDT distributor across the Cosmos. In other words, if a user wants an IBC denominated USDT that’s natively issued by Tether, that USDT needs to originate from Kava. In just a few short months, there has been over $150M USDT natively issued on the Kava blockchain.

WETH is also available as an OFT on Kava via Stargate, and WBTC will soon be issued natively on Kava by Bitgo as well. This provides a plethora of native asset markets for Aave on Kava with deep liquidity.

Some other bluechip deployments on Kava include Curve Finance, Beefy Finance, and an upcoming deployment from Yearn Finance as well.

Kava’s latest partnership with Tether, Bitgo, LayerZero and other DApps mentioned above signify its steady commitment to provide a top of the line DeFi ecosystem to users.

One unique benefit of an Aave v3 deployment on Kava is that Aave would be able to open up Cosmos based markets like ATOM natively on the EVM, which is currently not available on any other chain. We believe this opportunity to open up the Cosmos world to Aave presents a significant opportunity for the community.

# Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:

The Kava Foundation has done a good job of managing its treasury in this recent bear market. Currently the treasury stands at ~360M Kava. The Foundation is happy to seed liquidity in initial markets with up to 50M Kava over the first year.

As mentioned previously, the Kava Rise reward program exists to reward protocols pro-rata based on the amount TVL each project has on a monthly basis. With the commitment to seed liquidity, and the market opportunity for Aave to overtake the soon-to-be deprecated existing Kava Lend protocol, Aave has a clear opportunity to establish TVL and market dominance within the Kava ecosystem, and thereby earn a significant portion of existing 1M Kava/month liquidity mining rewards.

In short, not only will Kava Foundation commit to seeding liquidity, but that seeded liquidity will also drive the flywheel of liquidity mining rewards for Aave users on Kava.

Regardless of TVL, at a bare minimum, the Kava Foundation will commit to 1M Kava in liquidity mining rewards over the first year for the Aave community. It is completely up to the Aave community how it wants to use these rewards.

*About Kava Rise Program*

Kava Rise is an on-chain reward program that rewards builders on Kava. Rewards are distributed monthly on a pro-rata basis on the amount of TVL each project has. The current reward distribution is 1M Kava per month. And this amount can change/increase based on governance as the ecosystem continues to mature.

29,"**Summary:** Fjord and Balancer to become exclusive partners for LBPs. This exclusive partnership would include ERC-20s, NFTs, and new LBP use cases. Balancer to support the Fjord team with a grant of $500k USD (paid in BAL) and a new rev share to be implemented at the conclusion of the current agreement that will maintain long term alignment.

**Co-authors:** Fjord Team (Ri, PK, Evan, Odin, Kryptachio, Truss)

**Fjord (Copper) Progress to Date:**

Fjord has supported nearly $1.5b in LBP volume across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Avalanche since September of 2021 (and hopefully on BNB very soon).

* Fjord has supported 100+ LBPs across large well capitalized projects to small community projects. Projects supported include DAOs, guilds, gaming, defi projects, and more.

* Since Fjord began collecting revenue at the end of December 2021, nearly $1.6m in cash value has been distributed to the BalancerDAO wallet and under the current agreement Fjord provides 30% of Fjord revenue to the Balancer DAO.

* Fjord has strongly pushed for projects to keep liquidity on Balancer post LBP with some success, leading to further revenue and relationship opportunities.

* Fjord launched the first of its kind, LBPs for NFTs. While still in early stages, the team has high hopes to increase the Fjord user base and attractiveness of the platform by growing the NFT side of the house and to bring NFTs into the Balancer ecosystem.

* Fjord has seen a significant draw down of LBPs given the challenging market and while building the treasury to survive such down turns, has been required to engage in a large rebrand and faces significant legal and operational hurdles which have impacted runway.

* Fjord has significantly reduced monthly wages to extend our runway, but this path is not sustainable for the long term. From its current treasury, Fjord faces significant incorporation costs, blockchain analytics AML costs, and ongoing legal costs.

**Purpose / Motivation:**

The Fjord team highly values our relationship with Balancer (and the community) and would like to continue in furthering the reach of the Balancer Protocol. This has been a great relationship for both parties and we hope to build new use cases as well as strengthen the ones we have already proven viable.

To further diversify our portfolio, Fjord has moved into NFTs and is preparing to launch additional use cases for LBPs. We view NFTs as a strong pipeline for new users to flow into web3, and we want to position ourselves to capture significant market share, much in the way LBPs did for ERC-20s.

As we approach the conclusion of the current revenue share agreement between Fjord and Balancer, the Fjord team would like to further strengthen our relationship by entering into an exclusive partnership with Balancer and Fjord. Our team will continue to build upon LBPs for ERC-20s, NFTs, and develop new use cases which will broaden the reach of Balancer.

**Specification:**

As the Fjord team continues to build through this bear market, we would request the following grant to help fund our team to include the increasing legal and operational costs we face given the current environment. Fjord requests a grant of $500k USD (to be paid fully in BAL) over the course of six months to support ERC-20 and NFT LBPs development from Q4 2022 through Q1 2023.

* Key Milestones and Fjord Focus:
  * Refine NFT LBP drops on Balancer
  * Develope KYC type integration or other whitelisting solutions for LBP participation (adding optionality for teams)
  * Release MVP of new LBP use case(s)
  * Create a Fjord blog to increase user retention (among other features planned to increase retention and community growth)
  * Enable one-click movement of liquidity from Fjord to Balancer

* Balancer Feature Support:
  * Link to Fjord as the LBP partner for ERC-20s / NFT LBPs from Balancer’s UI
  * Collaborate closely on developing NFT solutions and extending LBP use cases and functionality
  * Enable 0 collateral LBPs
  * Conduct marketing support to promote our exclusive partnership, the release of new use cases, and increasing general awareness of Fjord Foundry and Fjord NFTs

* Grant Funding:
  * 80% of funding to be paid in Bal on a monthly basis
  * 20% of funding to be paid in veBAL to be locked for 1 year from the date of exclusivity

* Rev Share:
  * At the expiration of the current rev share (Feb 13, 2023), 30% rev share will remain in place until $500k in rev share to the DAO is met
  * From the date $500k is returned, the rev share will remain at 30% for six months
  * At the end of the six months, the rev share will be negotiated on an annual basis to maintain long term alignment between Balancer and Fjord

We think this rev share provides long term alignment, for if we have returned $500k this would mean ~$80mm would have been raised by LBPs (assuming 2% fee), and for $80mm to be raised this likely means we are no longer in a bear market (this could easily be 2 years from now).

The additional six months at 30% from this point provides Balancer with the upside over this same likely bull market time period.

![fjordFunding.png](ipfs://bafkreidiqfybwmb2tu2q7lcop7pxghpwzab3a6bnx4uqsvozpbh77u73d4)
    

*** Legal:**

  * In-house work for the next 1-2 months is expected to be more intensive, ~ 15 hours / month. Fjord has a planned execution framework with Cayman Council as well as advice from US counsel, but requires more nuanced crypto specific support

* Once the legal foundation is up and running, the team expects legal needs to sustain at 1 to 1.5 hours per week. This would include liaison support with outside counsel and feedback on legal implications of product decisions

* Entity structuring costs to build for resiliency

*** Marketing:**

  * Video production of an educational series of videos for B2B clients and participants in LBPs, Fair NFT drops and the new use cases we are exploring

* Social media growth and investing in various forms of content

* Hosting of and attendance of prominent web3 events to network

* PR opportunities

If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will send 77,000 BAL to the Grants Multisig `0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597` who will handle the payments to Fjord according to the schedule outlined in the proposal.",neutral
30,"[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum.](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-liquidity-staking/243). The proposed code to implement it can be found [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/tree/liquidity-staking).

# TLDR:

Proposal to have 45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity between BAL and uncapped tokens (WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC). Wallets flagged as Balancer Labs shareholders don't qualify for this ""liquidity staking"" extra incentive.
The main goals are to significantly increase liquidity on key BAL pairs and to allow non-shareholders to compound their BAL holdings at a much faster pace, accelerating protocol decentralization.

![image|621x500, 50%](upload://5S3GvpjON1hNGnO7wuSfqNd3smk.png)   


# Motivation

The **importance of BAL liquidity** can't be overstated:

* *TRUER PRICE DISCOVERY*: it improves trading conditions for all market participants (lower spreads and less slippage for both buyers and sellers), allowing for a more transparent and effective price discovery process;

* *SUPERIOR LP INCENTIVES*: a stronger token (with higher price inertia) results in a higher quality for the incentives given to LPs (liquidity providers) via liquidity mining;

* *SHARPER GOVERNANCE*: it opens doors to a new class of invaluable stakeholders and protocol governors (e.g. larger investors, especially those heavily involved in and experienced with DeFi protocols);

* *BROADER GOVERNANCE*: with no participation from Balancer Labs' shareholders (more on that later), liquidity staking will accelerate BAL distribution and protocol decentralization by giving all other BAL holders the opportunity to compound their governance rights at a much faster pace;

* *SAFER GOVERNANCE*: pools are non-custodial and BAL in them retain full voting power (i.e. no need to withdraw liquidity to vote), such that high liquidity and a healthy governance are not in conflict;

Balancer itself being a DEX, it feels only natural as the ideal venue for high BAL liquidity to be incentivized. Finally, it's worth noting that allowing a high portion of the token supply to be concentrated on *centralized* exchanges could expose the governance to significant risks, as illustrated by the episode with STEEM.


# Recapping: how liquidity adjustment currently works

The 145k BAL [weekly distribution](https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/bal-liquidity-mining) to LPs on Balancer is calculated proportionally to the *adjusted* liquidity contributed by each LP. This adjustment is made by applying (i.e. multiplying) a few *factors* to their liquidity measured in dollar terms.

Naturally, the value of those factors can be:
* equal to `1`, having no effect;
* less than `1`, acting as a penalty (when the liquidity is deemed less useful);
* greater than `1`, acting as an extra incentive.

A `feeFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-feefactor-toward-reducing-the-mining-penalty-for-high-fee-pools/103)) applies a small penalty to pools with higher fees.

**For each pair inside a pool**, we apply:
*  a `wrapFactor` of:
   * `1.0` for uncorrelated pairs (no penalty),
   * `0.2` for [soft pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-wrapfactor-applying-a-0-2-factor-to-soft-pegged-pairs/138),
   * `0.1` for [hard pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/wrapfactor-penalizing-pairs-of-equivalent-tokens-in-liquidity-mining/28); and 

* a `BRF` (BAL & Ratio Factor), which is the combination of a `ratioFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/introduction-of-a-weight-ratio-factor-in-liquidity-mining/15)) and a `stakingBoost ≥ 1` (described in [this proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102) and with further calculation details specified in its [ammendment](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102/4)). 
`BRF = stakingBoost * ratioFactor`
  * If the pair is **not** of type `{BAL & uncapped_token}` (uncapped tokens currently being: WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC, BAL), then its `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. the incentive doesn't apply to this pair).

The current `BRF` will only depend on the characteristics of the pool (its tokens and weights), and may have a maximum value of `1.54`. It looks like this:

![image|690x455, 75%](upload://xqztRzplangZYzS0j70jlwfgc7P.png) 

After looping through all possible pairs in a pool, we combine their factors (via [weighted average](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/master/lib/factors.js#L111)) and the result is a `wrapFactor` and a `BRF` for the whole pool. 

Finally, we calculate and apply a `tokenCapFactor` adjusting down the liquidity of a token when it exceeds a predetermined maximum. Except for the 5 uncapped tokens already mentioned, all tokens eligible for liquidity mining are currently capped at $10M each. See more details on [how to calculate it](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56) and the [recent changes](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217) to how token caps will evolve.

# The Proposal

This is a proposal to have **45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity staking**.

This extra incentive is:

> all BAL distributed as a result of applying a `stakingBoost > 1` to the liquidity of `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs, from wallets which are not flagged as shareholders of Balancer Labs.

The remaining **100k BAL would be distributed to all LPs** in all eligible pools, disconsidering the effect of a `stakingBoost` (i.e. all liquidity being subject to `BRF = ratioFactor`).

The constant value now would be: `STAKERS_SHARE = 45000 / 145000`, and we can then calculate the unique value for `stakingBoost` that satisfies this target distribution. 

The intended result is for BAL liquidity on Balancer to increase substantially, **but in a self-regulated way**. 

The simple yet powerful idea is: as BAL liquidity gets higher the extra incentive to staking gets **diluted among stakers**, so that our constant target for `STAKERS_SHARE` is met.

In a more visual approach:
 
* when non-shareholder BAL liquidity is low, the `stakingBoost` will be high, resulting in a high `BRF` (a hypothetical scenario being the **orange** curve in the graph below, in which `BRF` peaks at `12`), so there will be a *very strong* incentive for BAL liquidity to increase;

* when non-shareholer BAL liquidity is high (the desired scenario), the `stakingBoost` will have come down to lower levels, resulting in a lower BRF (a hypothetical scenario being the **green** curve below, in which `BRF` peaks at `3`).

![image|621x500](upload://oI5XnPgsZE1VcQWDyeJCWovr1IV.png)  

# Calculating the stakingBoost: a practical example

We first calculate the `liquidityPreStaking`: the total adjusted liquidity from applying all factors, but with `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. `BRF = ratioFactor`). Let's say the result was $200M.

We will need to apply a yet unknown stakingBoost so that:
```STAKERS_SHARE = (finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / finalLiquidity```

... which can also be stated as:
```finalLiquidity = liquidityPreStaking / (1 - STAKERS_SHARE)```

In our example:
```finalLiquidity = $200M / (1 - 45000/145000) = $290M```

We may apply any temporary `tempStakingBoost > 1` to `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs from non-shareholder LPs, resulting in a `tempLiquidity`. Let's say our result was $230M. This would mean the `tempStakingBoost` increased the adjusted liquidity in $30M, while what we actually want is an increase of $90M.

Now to get the desired `stakingBoost`, we only need to ""stretch"" or ""shrink"" the `tempStakingBoost` according to the ratio between the two liquidity adjustments (desired & temporary):

```
(finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / (tempLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
```
... which in our example would result in:
```
(290 - 200) / (230 - 200) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
stakingBoost = 3 * tempStakingBoost
```

# Shareholder Addresses

An important aspect of this proposal is that Balancer Labs shareholders (investors, advisors and founders) seem aligned with the spirit of the proposal: to accelerate governance rights distribution. In order to achieve this goal, their wallets will be excluded from participating in liquidity staking. This restriction doesn't apply to eventual BAL they hold that are unrelated to their shareholder allocations, for instance BAL bought on the market or earned through being LPs with tokens other than their BAL shareholder allocation.

[Here is the complete list of shareholder addresses to be excluded from liquidity staking](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/liquidity-staking/src/users.ts).

Note: wallets currently tagged as ""Balancer: Shareholder XX"" on Etherscan are actually *vesting smart contracts* which hold mostly locked (i.e. yet unvested) BAL. Vesting happens continuously and linearly over a period of 3 years which started at token launch (2020-06-20). When finally vested (i.e. free to transfer), BAL can only be withdrawn to the respective beneficiary address of each vesting contract. The addresses listed above are the 51 unique beneficiaries of the 51 vesting contracts. All the BAL balance they already hold is vested.

The community is willing to tolerate up to about 10k BAL per week per shareholder being sent to centralized exchanges as they are cognizant of shareholders also seeking to deleverage their BAL positions over time, without attempting to subvert the exclusion list. In case some large BAL balances move to third-party custody solutions held in segregated addresses or to multisig wallets (both situations are likely to happen), the current list may be updated to reflect those new shareholder addresses as also excluded from liquidity staking.

The community will have the prerogative to update this list so that changes are effective already before any still pending weekly distribution.",bullish
31,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes pSTAKE ($PSTAKE) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with pSTAKE! 

Developed by Persistence, pSTAKE is a multi-chain liquid staking protocol that unlocks the liquidity of proof-of-stake assets by issuing staked representative tokens (e.g. stkBNB) against users’ bonded assets, allowing them to earn DeFi yields on top of staking rewards. It is currently live on Cosmos, Ethereum, and BNB Chain.

BNB holders can liquid stake their tokens [**here**](https://bnb.pstake.finance/) to mint stkBNB and further use it in the BNB Chain DeFi ecosystem (eg. on PancakeSwap).

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn PSTAKE tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 950,000 PSTAKE
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1300 UTC on 25 Apr 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1300 UTC on 24 Jun 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.5497 PSTAKE

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the PSTAKE Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a **stkBNB-BNB (0.05% fee tier)** and a **PSTAKE-CAKE (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm on BNB Chain.  


The **stkBNB-BNB (0.05% fee tier)** v3 farm will have 12x CAKE rewards, while the **PSTAKE-CAKE (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm will have 4x CAKE rewards for the entire 60 days . At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1300 UTC on 24 Jun 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $PSTAKE?

PSTAKE is the governance token of pSTAKE Finance – PSTAKE holders can participate in the protocol’s governance and protocol improvement proposals to ensure long term security of the protocol. It is also used to align incentives of all the stakeholders within the pSTAKE ecosystem.

#### What is $stkBNB?

stkBNB is the staked representative of BNB issued by pSTAKE that allows for a more secure BNB Chain and higher BNB DeFi yields. Under the hood, the staked BNB is delegated to a robust set of 10 validators that optimizes for APR without compromising security. pSTAKE only charges 5% of fees for liquid staking your BNB. stkBNB has been audited by Peckshield, Halborn, & Certora. An on-chain monitoring system with Forta, bug-bounty on Immunefi, and stress tests by the BNB Chain team add to a secure liquid staking experience.

**Title:** [ARFC] Chaos Labs - Update WETH IR on V3 Arbitrum and Optimism - 02.16.2024 
**Author:** Chaos Labs
**Date:** 2024-02-16

---

### Simple Summary

Decrease slope1 on Arbitrum and Optimism from 3.3% to 3%.

### Motivation

Over the last eight months, we have observed a drop-off in WETH interest rates on Ethereum and, thus, relative demand for ETH borrowing.

*Time series of WETH borrow APY on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism, in addition to stETH APY.*


Note that the red dotted line indicates the point when the base_fee decreased from 1% to 0% on Arbitrum and Optimism. This phenomenon can be explained by the drop-off in ETH staking yield, as we can deduce through the relatively strong correlation between WETH borrow APY and stETH staking APY on Ethereum due to profitable looping strategies. Additionally, given Aave prices stETH:ETH 1:1 with the underlying exchange rate, minimal liquidation risk exists in potential wstETH market price movements.

**Correlation Between stETH APY and WETH APY**

*Cross-correlation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*

Computing the cross-correlation between the three markets, we notice an approximately 1-week lag when this hits the maximum value, implying the speed at which the borrow rates are maximally reflected in the staking APY.

This is statistically significant, as we can see below, where 85%-90% of all WETH debt is backed by ETH LSTs on the respective chain.

### stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY

Interestingly enough, one might think that as stETH yields decrease, looping strategies would become less profitable. However, upon analyzing the difference between the stETH APY and WETH borrow APY (stETH APY - WETH APY) alongside the stETH APY itself at a given time t, a negative correlation emerges, with the peak occurring at a 2-week lag. Essentially, this means that the rate of decrease in borrow APY over time outpaces that of the stETH APY. Thus, we can conclude that when stETH APYs are high, borrowers attempt to extract as much revenue as possible, leading to convergence at lower yields. On the contrary, when stETH APYs are low, borrowers and ETH borrow APYs tend to be less aggressive with looping, perhaps due to theoretical scaling in the interest rate requiring smaller growth to become unprofitable, leading to the effective yield scaling higher than instances when stETH APYs are high. This in turn leads to less efficient markets and larger spreads when ETH staking yields are low.

**stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY**

*Time series of stETH APY - WETH APY. stETH APY plotted on secondary axis.*

*Cross-correlation between (stETH - WETH borrow APY) and stETH APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*

**WETH Utilization Rates**

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreihjpcivhoywbhley2ysf4zaaa7nqmkqtsx7f3rt33dvphemir6w4u)
    
*WETH Utilization rate time series.*

Based on the observed trend, it's evident that Arbitrum and Optimism could benefit from a reduction in slope1 to enhance utilization rates and consequently increase revenues. While the decrease in base_rate on both chains did positively impact utilization, it remains suboptimal. Thus, we simply take the P95 of the stETH APY differential vs WETH borrow APY since the base_rate decrease, which returned 0.6%, to derive the decrease in slope1. Considering the Uoptimal rate is projected to be below the current stETH APY with a 0.6% variance, any prolonged convergence above Uoptimal could lead to interest rate volatility. In such a scenario, it would be prudent to revert slope1. However, given the current trend and staking APY, this adjustment would likely result in higher utilization rates and greater profits for the Aave DAO.

Assuming convergence at today’s WETH interest rates:

|  | Arbitrum | Optimism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Old Utilization Rate | 68.69% | 65% |
| New Utilization Rate | 76.5% | 72% |
| Projected Revenue Increase | 13.62 ETH $38.5k year | 4 ETH $11.3k year |

We note that adjusting WETH slope1 on other non-Ethereum chains with this intuition is seen as irrelevant, as either the market itself portrays too small a sample size with minimal relative demand for ETH LSTs as collateral, there does not exist ETH LSTs on the chain or ETH LST supply caps have been at max capacity for months.

###  Specification

| Chain | Asset |Parameter | Currebt |Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- | ---| ---|
| Arbitrum | WETH |Slope1| 3.3% | 3% |
| Optimism | WETH|Slope1|3.3% | 3% |

36,"Overview:
-
\
This proposal aims to cover important smart contract upgrades that will allow for the rescue of user funds, improved pausing functionality and additional safeguards via blacklisting.

This proposal will not cover the **execution** of the proposed rescue function and unpausing. Those items will be addressed later via a future BIP.

Specifics:
-
\
**Upgrade all affected Setts with the following new functionality:**

* add **rescue function** to transfer sett tokens from attacker wallets to recovered.badgerdao.eth (one time use - patchBalance() function)
* add a ‘**global pause**’ feature that allows all Sett contracts to be paused and unpaused simultaneously with the same permissions as current pausing functionality
* add global **blacklist** to block actions, set to the attackers wallets listed below

**Blacklisted Attacker wallets:**

* 0x1FCdb04d0C5364FBd92C73cA8AF9BAA72c269107
* 0xa33B95ea28542Ada32117B60E4F5B4cB7D1Fc19B
* 0x4fbf7701b3078B5bed6F3e64dF3AE09650eE7DE5
* 0x1B1b391D1026A4e3fB7F082ede068B25358a61F2
* 0xEcD91D07b1b6B81d24F2a469de8e47E3fe3050fd

* 0xe06eD65924dB2e7b4c83E07079A424C8a36701E5

**NOTE**: Approval to execute the following actions will be submitted via a future BIP that will undergo the Badger Governance Process:

* Execute the new patchBalances() function to rescue funds from the attacker to the recovery multisig
* Unpausing the Sett contract to resume normal operation

Why is this BIP being expedited?
-
\
Badger is committed to reopening smart contracts as soon as it is safe to do so. Given the timelock considerations, waiting for the standard timeframe before making these upgrades would add a minimum 3 day lag once the final BIP to execute the proposed actions to rescue funds and unpause is decided.

As such, this proposal uncouples the smart contract upgrades from the execution of the rescue action and unpausing so that the execution decision can follow Badger’s governance process, while also ensuring the resulting governance decision can be enacted promptly.

Amended requirements to pass expedited governance proposal:
-
\
Given this BIP will go directly to snapshot, it will require a supermajority of over 70% at a quorum of more than 200,000 votes in order to pass.

Supporting Parameter Changes:
-
\
Additionally, among the older contracts, 1 Sett and 8 Strategy contracts have the Timelock set as their governance address. In order to align them with the rest of the infrastructure, Badger will change their governance to the [devMultisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB65cef03b9B89f99517643226d76e286ee999e77).

This will give Badger the ability to handle unpausing and transferring tokens away from attacker wallets atomically and with agility, which is the preferred technical approach to the situation. Badger intends to propose using the timelock for all key parameter changes as part of the future governance 2.0 initiatives.

Note that the timelock is still needed for upgrades or adding new strategies which are the critical operations that involve handling of user funds.

This transaction will require going through the Timelock process. Once executed, the unpausing of the whole infrastructure will be handled by the devMultisig directly and no timelock will be required for it.

TL;DR - 2 Years of branded advertising on all Bored Brewing Cans & Free Beer for $Ape Holders at collaborated community events.

We want to spread the word of ApeCoin by integrating $APE into the packaging of our beer. This will include creating an $APE coin beer, QR codes on all cans to share information about the DAO and $APE, expanded IP with other NFT collections to merge our common interests.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

We see a tangible benefit from two parties:

1. We will be sponsoring partnered events and sharing the $APE coin brand across other relevant crypto/nft communities. The goal is to market the coin and share the background and goals of the DAO for the future.
2. We will be spreading knowledge about $APE coin to less crypto native people who enjoy drinking beer. We believe that $APE can become a currency for the digital revolution and we want to be a small part of spreading the name to people outside of the crypto community.


#### OVERALL COST

$175,000 USD in $APE towards ApeCoin educational landings through trackable QR Codes, 10,000 Beer for Frens, ApeCoin DAO Dark Lager (name tbd) in the hands of normies, and 1 Lucky winner of their own Web3 IP Branded Beer!

During the farm, or at the end of the 90-day period – approx. 1300 UTC on 2 Oct 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

We request for further flexibility in the multiplier, fee tier, and duration of the PENDLE farm. The aggregate CAKE emission to all PENDLE farm(s) will remain the same, but we may adjust the multiplier(s) and duration of the farm(s) to ensure high utilization rates, ultimately maximizing CAKE burn from trading volume.

#### What is $PENDLE?

From the team: “Users can lock PENDLE to receive Vote-escrowed PENDLE, also known as vePENDLE. Pendle's governance relies on vePENDLE, which enables a higher degree of decentralization. By utilizing vePENDLE, PENDLE holders gain access to an array of features that increase the token's utility, such as:
- Boosting one’s liquidity provision APY
- Receiving a share of protocol revenue
- Voting for pools to channel PENDLE incentives
- Receiving swap fees from voted pools”

#### How to bridge $PENDLE to BNB Chain?

Portal Bridge by Wormhole supports bridging of PENDLE from Ethereum to BNB Chain. You may access the bridge [**here**](https://www.portalbridge.com/#/transfer).

The token contract address for PENDLE on Ethereum is:

45,"Because of the complexity of all of the moving parts with the tokenomics V3, we are pushing forward with mechanical pieces first that will require the most development work and timeline.

Here are the updated mechanics that are the key changes to be implemented (if approved) and impact the actual protocols of Venus.

The income allocation is split into two pieces - and we expect further changes to be proposed to the DAO and community based on financing of the risk fund, and there will be a secondary discussion on the tokenomics specifically regarding the Burn and /or inflation emissions of XVS. I want to reiterate that the burn / inflation cut off is intentionally left out of this, as it is not a mechanical and technical upgrade to the protocols, and so will be the primary part of the second half of the V3 tokenomics update.

Key changes to Venus Protocols

-Revenue Allocation Update
-XVS Vault Mechanics
-Prime Token Issuance & Integration to Venus Markets.

Revenue Allocation Update

Market Revenue Allocation Only. For the Venus Prime Pilot period - its APY boost will only be based on the interest reserves revenue, directly tied to the TVL. This means there will be two income allocation schemes initially, with the goal of condensing them into one after the Pilot period.

Revenue Portion	Allocation Segment
40%	Risk Fund (including financing)
20%	XVS Vault Rewards
20%	DAO Operations & Funding
20%	Venus Prime Token Program

The Risk Fund, being established to cover the shortfalls of the protocol in the case of ineffective or delayed liquidations, will comprise 40% of the protocol revenues. This 40% may also be used as a means to finance the current shortfall and provide an immediate upfront buffer to the risk fund via a financing (bond) mechanism.

The XVS Vault rewards of 20% remains the same
The DAO Operations budget will be cut from 30% to 20%
The former 20% buyback and burn allocation will be transferred to the 20% allocation to the Venus Prime Token.

Because Venus is rolling out new products that have varying impacts, the income to Venus Prime is limited to interest reserves only. As such this income allocation schema applies to liquidations and new product revenues, until technically and from a tokenomics perspective we understand how to properly allocate and incentivize the Prime Token holders for each new product.

Revenue Portion / Allocation Segment

48% Risk Fund (including financing)
26%	 XVS Vault Rewards
26%	 DAO Operations & Funding

XVS Vault Mechanics Details

The XVS Vault will be upgraded such that when users request a withdrawal, those balances will no longer qualify for earning staking rewards, they will be considered already liquid and withdrawn from the vault.

The XVS Staked in the vault will be used in the case of a shortfall (only going forward after depletion of the Risk Fund) to cover the shortfall, using up to a maximum of 10% of the XVS staked in the vault. This means that staking XVS you are putting 10% of your funds at risk to cover shortfalls in the event that the protocol cannot cover it first with the funds in the Risk Fund or other liquidations remediations methodologies. 10% is the maximum amount any single staker can lose (compared to 30% on AAVE), but justifies the rewards earned by staking XVS in the vault. 

The Vault will integrate the Venus Prime Token - issuing, upgrading and downgrading the token based on the metrics described below in the Venus Prime Token. The Vault becomes the Manager of the Prime Token contract, thus performing the various duties required to manage the tokens.
Venus Prime Token Details

Venus Prime Token is a Soul Bound Token (non-transferrable NFT).

There are two forms of the SBT, the “OG Irrevocable Token” and the “Earned Revocable Token”.

A user can only have either an OG or an Earned token, they cannot hold both.

The OG Token will be issued by the Venus DAO to a select group of up to 100 “OG” users based on certain criteria defined by the DAO over the past 18 months. The OG Tokens will automatically have the highest tier of qualifying balances, regardless of the amount of XVS Stake. These tokens cannot be burned, “revoked”, and cannot be transferred to any other wallets.

Earned Tokens will be a non-transferable token that can be rewarded to users based on meeting the below criteria. If they fail to maintain the minimum criteria, then their Token will be burned and revoked, and the process to earn another token will restart.

The minimum to qualify to receive a Venus Prime token is to stake 1,000 XVS tokens in the XVS Vault and keep the XVS staked (and not withdrawn) for at least 90 days. Once the 90-day time has passed, users will be able to claim the Prime Token, which is then issued by the XVS Vault. When a user requests a withdrawal of tokens that would result in their staking balance being lower than 1,000, then their Prime Token will be burned.

If the user stakes more XVS to qualify for the next tier, once a 30-day staking time has passed they can trigger an upgrade to their token to that tier

If they withdraw some XVS but still above the 1,000 level - this will trigger a downgrade to their token, downgrading it to the level applicable to the amount of XVS Staked.

Prime Tokens themselves do not enable value, but rather the tokens allow users to earn boosted yields on selected markets, based on tiers and a capping system. The users with a Prime Token will automatically receive boosted APYs continuously from the Markets Protocol, based on the Markets Upgrade.

The Markets Upgrade will enhance the protocol such that it will incorporate the balances that are owned by Prime Token Holders - issuing them 20% of the revenue earned by the protocol directly from the Markets, continuously distributing the APY to those Prime Token Holders.

XVS Tiers

Users need to stake a minimum of 1,000 XVS to reach tier 1, and then once they stake additional XVS can upgrade their Prime Token to the applicable level based on the amount of XVS staked, having then staked it for at least 30 days additional.

If you immediately stake XVS at a higher tier, your token issued will automatically take the highest tier possible, the upgrade only impacts if you were issued a lower tier and then stake additional XVS to reach the next level (or beyond).

Tier	XVS Staked
1	1,000
2	5,000
3	10,000
4	50,000
5	100,000

Caps on the Qualifying Balances

The Markets Protocols will have caps on the balances that qualify for the boosted APY. This enables more lower tier participants to receive higher boosts, without being fully diluted by the largest holders and depositors of the markets.

All participants are paid the same effective APY, based on their balances up to the cap limits.

The supply cap is half the amount of the borrow cap.

Each market has an individual supply and borrow cap.

The caps here are represented by a dollar amount, but will mechanically be set as a cryptocurrency amount, and reset back to the dollar amount on a regular basis.

Vesta Finance has requested the swap fee be changed on WETH/VSTA [Arbitrum] to 1% but the Maxis currently lack the role to do so. They plan to use this pool as part of a staking/farming system. This proposal grants the Maxi LM multisig on Arbitrum the role for changing swap fees on v1 weighted pools on Arbitrum.

### Specification

The DAO Multisig on Arbitrum `arb1:0xaF23DC5983230E9eEAf93280e312e57539D098D0` will interact with the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling `grantRole` with the following arguments:

49,"## Simple summary

Proposal for the approval of an interim distribution of 300’000 stable-coins from the Aave Collector to allow partial withdrawals by aAMPL suppliers to Aave v2 Ethereum, consequence of the problem detected end 2023.

Additionally, this proposal will include technical updates on the AMPL reserve to better settle accounting for this distribution.

 

## Motivation

On December 2023, a problem was detected on the AMPL custom reserve on Aave v2 Ethereum, causing an unexpected inflation of AMPL-related balances and supply, not following the intended design by the Ampleforth team.

While further analysis is performed for the most reasonable strategy on giving withdrawal liquidity for aAMPL supplies, an interim distribution of 300’000 USD value is proposed as lower threshold, to allow aAMPL suppliers to proceed partially with their withdrawals.

Also, as follow-up of previous AIPs, this proposal will include extra steps of not create problems accounting wise.

Important to read the full context on https://governance.aave.com/t/ampl-problem-on-aave-v2-ethereum/15886.

 

## Specification

The specific technical details will be defined at AIP stage once this ARFC will be approved, but high-level the payload will contain the following:

- Activation of a USDC/USDT distribution on AaveMerkleDistributor contract used in the past for the Rescue Mission of assets that users mistakenly sent to Aave contracts. The claims of each account will be defined as the percentage of the aAMPL total supply each one holds.
- Release of the 300’000 USD to the AaveMerkleDistributor.
- Update on the Aave v3 Ethereum pool for any kind of technical update (exclusively affecting the AMPL reserve) deemed necessary by technical service providers of the DAO.

 

## Disclaimer

BGD Labs is presenting this proposal within its engagement for technical services with the Aave DAO. Execution of it will depend exclusively on the decentralised Aave governance approving.

 

## Next Steps

1. In parallel with this Snapshot vote, preparing the final technical details of the AIP.
2. If the Snapshot outcome is YES, escalate to on-chain AIP stage.

**Authors**: Synapse DAO contributors, with support from Aura contributors

**Summary** 

Synapse DAO is seeking the whitelisting of a Balancer gauge for a 50/50 SYN/ETH pool.

**Protocol Description**

Synapse is a cross-chain communications protocol, launched Q3 2021. Synapse enables the transfer of reserve assets (stablecoins, ether, etc.) and partner assets (e.g. gOHM, VSTA, GMX, etc.) across a number of EVM and non-EVM compatible chains. Since launch, Synapse has processed $12.5b worth of cross-chain bridge transactions, across hundreds of thousands of transactions. 

Synapse has a native governance token SYN, which is distributed to liquidity providers. SYN is currently tradable on both decentralized and centralized exchanges, with robust liquidity currently on SushiSwap. 

**Motivation**

SYN currently has a large 50/50 pool of liquidity on Sushi. As of this proposal’s writing, the pool has liquidity of $10m, with over $10 million worth of trading volume in the past 24 hours. Synapse as a protocol is incentivizing the liquidity of the pool with SYN incentives. Sushi also has incentivized the pool with a small amount of SUSHI, totaling ~$1,500 a day. 

Synapse can increase the yield of the pool by migrating liquidity to Balancer, then incentivizing vlAURA votes for the pool via Hidden Hand. With a current voting incentive efficiency over 2.5x, Synapse will benefit greatly from migrating to Balancer. 

**Specifications** 

- **Governance:** The Synapse DAO is the overarching governance structure of the protocol. DAO memmbers contribute to the protocol and help curate proposals for larger decisions. You can find out more information here: [https://forum.synapseprotocol.com/](https://forum.synapseprotocol.com/)
- **Oracles:** The protocol does not rely on external oracles at the moment. All relevant contract work is done on chain
- **Audits:** Synapse has a history of audits from Certik, OpenZeppelin, and Quantstamp, along with ongoing audits. More information about Synapse’s audit history can be found [here](https://docs.synapseprotocol.com/security/audits).
- **Centralization vectors:** There are no direct lines of centralization, smart contracts custody funds on each side of the bridge
- **Market history:** SYN has been an actively traded coin since Q3 2021. It is a liquid asset across both prominent decentralized and centralized venues.

Authors: StaFi Contributors, with support from Aura contributors

**Summary**

StaFi proposes the creation of a Balancer gauge for a rETH-ETH pool on mainnet, with a 10% emissions cap.

**Protocol Description**

StaFi is a liquid staked derivatives protocol launched in Q3 2020, with a focus on bringing liquidity to staked assets on Ethereum and other Proof of Stake chains such as Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot. Since launch, the protocol has accrued over $36,000,000 worth of staked assets across 11 tokens, with 3,439 active validators.

Similar to other LSD protocols, StaFi issues a liquid receipt token (rETH) representing your share of ether staked on the Beacon Chain via a permissionless validator set. Deposits are partially covered by validator deposits. The exchange rate between rETH/ETH will gradually increase as staking rewards accumulate, though rETH is not redeemable for the ether principal and rewards until after the Shanghai upgrade.

StaFi has a native governance token with the ticker “FIS”. FIS is freely tradable on a number of centralized exchanges, alongside some decentralized exchanges not inclusive of Balancer. FIS has governance utility and can be staked by validators in the StaFi consensus network.

**Motivation**

StaFi currently has an[ existing rETH-ETH pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/reth/deposit) on Curve that sees regular trades between both assets.

StaFi is looking to expand the availability and liquidity of its staked derivatives, starting with rETH, through Balancer. Ahead of and after the Shanghai Ethereum hard fork, liquidity and yield on LSDs will be a key competing factor as LSD protocols seek integrations and a broader base of holders.

StaFi is committed to driving value to the veBAL ecosystem by incentivizing pool liquidity via Hidden Hand voting incentives. Deeper liquidity should lead to increased volume and revenue accrual.

**Specifications**

1. Governance: [DAO forum](https://commonwealth.im/stafi)
2. Oracles: Direct Balance Query: The rETH rateProvider has a getRate() function that calls rETH's own getExchangeRate() function. See the [contract here](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/rtoken-contracts/blob/main/contracts/balancer-metastable-rate-providers/RETHRateProvider.sol)
3. Audits: [StaFi rToken App Audits](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/stafi-bootstrap/tree/master/audits)
4. Centralization Vectors:StaFi’s rebalancing is done by a bot that is run by the foundation. Presently the bot is not profitable to run, so we would not expect anyone else to run it. However, there is no chance of money being inaccessible as a result of the bot stopping–Just that the bridge would run less efficiently.
5. Market History: rETH has been a tradable asset since March 2021. Trading has primarily taken place in the aforementioned rETH-ETH pool on Curve. FIS is a liquid asset traded both on top centralized exchanges as well as decentralized exchanges.
6. Value: StaFi will make its Balancer rETH-ETH pool a primary source of liquidity for rETH on Ethereum mainnet. By bolstering liquidity of the pool, Balancer should gain from increased trading fees.

57,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-pickle-finance-in-vebal-s-votingescrow/3182)


## Vision

[Pickle Finance][2] aims to become the home for Balancer LPs to enjoy the best possible returns and to become a major collaborator in the governance of the Balancer Protocol. 

## Abstract

Pickle is building a module on top of Balancer's Gauge system that seeks to aid Balancer LPs and prospective `veBAL` participants in maximising the utility of their deposits with Balancer, while also enhancing the overall utility of the Balancer's Gauge system by creating a liquid `veBAL` derivative.

Similar to other ""boosting protocols"", Pickle aims to create these synergies by providing an easy mechanism for the aggregation of `veBAL` boosts and for prospective Balancer LPs to benefit from this boost.

The Pickle and Balancer teams are no strangers to each other, with Pickle being invited and expressing its willingness to join the Balancer Wars as early as the Gauge system was announced. Pickle has borrowed from its unique experience running a Gauge system for itself and building on top of other boosting modules like Convex to come up with a unique system we call the Brinery. 

As a gesture of goodwill and to encourage the creation and adoption of the Balancer Brinery, Pickle will be providing incentives (in `$PICKLE` tokens) to both those who vote to whitelist us and those who join the Brinery early on. These incentives will be detailed pending their approval by Pickle governance. The Balancer community can expect the Pickle Core team to propose between 2-3% of the `PICKLE` supply to be awarded to Balancer Brinery incentives, with rougly 80% of these reserved for joiners and 20% for voters.

This proposal makes no request to the Balancer community for financial assistance to Pickle. We are a solvent, revenue-generating protocol with a healthy balance sheet. Our interest is in providing a superior service to Balancer users and to create a symbiotic relationship between our communities.

## Brinery Specification: Architecture & Design

The Brinery will provide a seamless experience for users to join `veBAL`. Our proposed system works in the following manner: 
1. Users deposit 80/20 BAL/ETH `BPT` with Pickle
2. Users receive **brinBAL** in return
3. Under the hood, Pickle will:
  a) Lock up a portion of `BAL/ETH` for `veBAL` in perpetuity - a receipt token is issued for the locked amount as **pveBAL**. A portion of `BAL/ETH` liquidity is retained
  b) Supply `pveBAL` and retained `BAL/ETH` into a new Balancer pool
4. Users can redeem `brinBAL` for their proportionate share of `pveBAL` and `BAL/ETH` (or in a single asset if they wish)

This design has the advantage of guaranteeing liquidity for Pickle's `veBAL` derivative. The Brinery contracts will have flexibility in managing liquidity to achieve the proper balance between liquidity and maximal rewards. Users who hold `brinBAL` will receive Balancer governance rewards (all fee-sharing rewards, emissions, and bribe proceeds will be consolidated into BAL tokens), the Brinery's ""flywheel"" rewards (`BAL` ""taxed"" from Brinery boosted PickleJars), and of course `PICKLE` tokens. 

For users familiar with our standard PickleJar, a series of Brinery Boosted Jars, or ""brinJars"", will be on offer to compound users' BPT positions, taking advantage of boosted rewards from the Brinery's `veBAL` lock, alongside `PICKLE` incentives. These novel Balancer Jars will rely on state-of-the-art infrastructure and comply with the EIP-4626 standard for maximal efficiency, security, and composability. 

## Pickle

### History

Pickle is one of the original yield aggregators in DeFi, bringing innovations such as incentivised auto-farming with its PickleJars. We have been building as an Ethereum-based DAO since September 2020. Our builders are well-known and have collaborated over their time in DeFi with many top-notch protocols and teams to build, conduct security reviews, or brainstorm and validate ideas. To name a few: Yearn, Sushi, Curve, Polygon, Frax, Alchemix, and of course, Balancer.

Pickle has crossed paths with Balancer on several occasions. Pickle was the first yield aggregator to build on top of Balancer on its launch in Polygon. Moreover, our `PICKLE-ETH` was only the second pool after `BAL-ETH` to launch with Balancer on Arbitrum. A cursory look at the [BAL mining scripts on GitHub][1] shows we are 1 of 11 Balancer partners. On Arbitrum, we are 1 of 3. We are brethren in DeFi and hope to remain so for many years to come.

Finally, Pickle was the first-ever protocol to adapt Curve's Gauge system to align its users and token holders into a better governance system we call `DILL`. More than 51% of all `PICKLE` is currently locked for an average of 3.23 years, with almost 1,000 `DILL` holders forming the DAO that backs our protocol.

### Team

Pickle is led by myself, joined by the rest of the core team which currently consists of another 12 individuals with a wide range of skills in product, product marketing, UX design, smart contracts engineering, and frontend and Web3 infrastructure development. 

### Governance

Pickle is run according to the principle of ""progressive decentralisation"" by the DILL DAO. DILL governance is currently upgrading so DILL holders receive 100% of protocol revenues generated by Pickle, in ETH, plus PICKLE anti-dilutive rewards. At present, using Pickle's Gauge system, DILL holders can vote on-chain for where PICKLE emissions should go. With support for delegation currently in development, Pickle aims to launch its own ""Pickle voting module"" so users can participate in governance, including PICKLE emission allocations across sidechains, via secure offchain voting.

The Pickle voting module to provide DILL holders an interface for directing `veBAL` voting power held by Pickle's Balancer Brinery, as well as select the allocation of PICKLE emissions amongst our various Brinery products. 

## Specification

If this vote passes, the Balancer DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction with `0x7869296Efd0a76872fEE62A058C8fBca5c1c826C` calling the function `allowlistAddress` with the argument `0x93318d4b44558f57B688C6943fA9E2c3e52540B0`

59,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. 



## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV.** The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. 


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **CRV Liquidation Threshold**    | 64%     | ***61%***     |
| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 8.5%     | 8.0%     |
| DAI Liquidation Threshold     | 85%     | 90%     |
| WBTC Liquidation Threshold     | 75%     | 80%     |
| WBTC Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 5.0%     |



## Notable Accounts to Flag

As of 8/18/2022, the data shows that no accounts would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on this forum post.


## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

60,"Summary:

Harmony is proposing to work with the Curve to deploy Curve on the Harmony blockchain. This will expand stablecoin swap to its community of users and provide incentives to bootstrap the launch of Curve to a new ecosystem.

Abstract:

Our proposal is to support Curve as it continues to expand in the coming multi-chain world. Harmony is an open and fast blockchain that is fully Ethereum compatible with 2-second transaction finality and near-zero fees.

Harmony invites the Curve community to support this launch. Harmony will provide $2 million in incentives in ONE tokens to bootstrap initial usage of Curve on Harmony. We also propose the Curve community to contribute CRV tokens to add incentives to the launch.

In addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support.

Harmony is a sharded proof-of-stake blockchain. It has processed more than 93 million transactions on mainnet 4 and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible. Our secure bridges offer cross-chain asset transfers with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.

Motivation:

Curve is ready to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Harmony ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Sushi on Harmony and other DeFi projects.

A unique feature of Harmony is our bridges to Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain which are bringing in stablecoins and pegged assets from both ecosystems, i.e. ethBUSD-bscBUSD. This creates an unique opportunity for Curve to support stablecoin swapping of assets from multiple chains.

Specification:

The Harmony and Curve will deploy the Curve contracts and gauge on Harmony. Harmony supports EVM and Ethereum tooling, leading to a seamless integration, much like other EVM chains and L2s. During Harmony’s DeFi Hackathon in Sep 2020, a community team already successfully ported Curve on testnet: GitHub - harmony-one/dapp-curve-contracts 3 and GitHub - harmony-one/dapp-curve-ui: Frontend for curve.fi on harmony.one 6).

After the market is functional, we will work with the Curve for cross-chain governance implementation on Curve on Harmony.

Metrics
over 18,010 delegators and 118 validators, staking 4.2 billion ONEs ($700m staked)
$84 million TVL on Sushi on Harmony, and $30 million combined on other DEXes
$91 million TVL on Harmony’s bridge to Ethereum and BSC
3,200 creators and $1.6 million sales on DaVinci NFT marketplace

Months 1-3: 40%
Months 4-6: 30%
Months 7-9: 20%
Months 10-12: 10%

For:

Curve will be the first major stablecoin swap on Harmony and will add net new users from Harmony’s 350,000+ community members. After enabling DeFi primitives like AMMs, our community is eagerly awaiting a stablecoin swap on Harmony.

• [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tBTC_project)


**Protocol Description:**

> tBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin, that is 1:1 backed by mainnet BTC. 
Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. tBTC is trust minimised and redeemable for mainnet BTC without a centralized custodian. 
tBTC is built with Threshold Network’s decentralized infrastructure, and Ethereum.


**Motivation:**

> This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the Balancer tBTC/WBTC pool on Arbitrum.
Threshold DAO has recently launched a [L2 growth campaign with Wormhole](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/11/threshold-network-goes-live-with-wormhole-to-bridge-bitcoin-to-20-blockchains/), which has enabled a canonical tBTC bridge to Arbitrum.
The DAO has budgeted T token bribes to incentivise this tBTC/WBTC pool, with the goal to attract liquidity to the pool and Balancer. Threshold DAO intends tBTC to become a core component of Balancer BTC liquidity on Arbitrum.
These pools are part of the tBTC launch promotion on Arbitrum which will commence next week and feature Balancer as a liquidity target and collaborator. There is currently another proposal in the forum to enable the tBTC/ETH gauge.


**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** tBTC operates on Threshold DAO’s decentralized threshold encryption protocol. Threshold DAO is governed by the network’s work token, T. T token holders govern the DAO via proposals raised to the Threshold forum, which can be raised to a vote via Snapshot, as well as the on-chain Governor Bravo module.
    

2. **Oracles:** tBTC does not rely on an oracle price feed.


3. **Audits:** [Least Authority](https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-keep-network-tbtc-bridge-v2/) 
[Chainsecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/threshold-network/) 
[Certik](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/threshold-network) 
[Immunefi Bug Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/) 

4. **Centralization vectors:** Threshold Network governance is decentralized, and updates are ratified by the DAO via token holder vote. tBTC contract updates are currently managed by the Council multi-sig, with plans to migrate control to the DAO once cross-chain deployment is complete.


5. **Market History:** tBTC is a wrapped BTC token, and is pegged to the price of BTC. Since launch, tBTC’s price has not significantly diverged from that of BTC. tBTC launched in January of 2023, and currently has ~700 BTC to collateralize the ~700 tBTC.
 
6. **Value:** The Arbitrum tBTC/WBTC pool is intended to be a lynchpin of BTC liquidity on Arbitrum.
Threshold DAO has allocated a portion of its incentives budget to bribe the tBTC/WBTC pool using Paladin. This will incentivise veBAL holders to vote on our gauge to direct protocol emissions and attract TVL as part of the Arbitrum tBTC growth strategy.
Furthermore, Balancer will feature featuring in the Arbitrum launch promotion that Threshold DAO will commence next week. Lastly, Balancer will benefit by attracting additional BTC liquidity to Arbitrum.

> SUMMARY:

This proposal aims to add a new veBAL gauge for a new TEMPLE/DAI 50/50 weighted pool on Ethereum.

> PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION:

TEMPLE is a Treasury value backed token. We chose Balancer to deploy our AMO-styled price defense contract (RAMOS) which paired TEMPLE token to approximately $9mm USD worth of stables initially held in the Balancer USD (bb-a-USD) liquidity pool. The RAMOS contract protected TEMPLE token price from falling below the Treasury stable value backing each token.

**References/Useful links:**

Website: templedao.link

Github Page: github.com/TempleDAO/TempleDAO

Communities: discord.gg/templedao / Twitter: @templedao


> MOTIVATION:

In February of 2023, Balancer Team uncovered a reentrancy vulnerability for the boosted pools and stopped collecting protocol fees for bb-a-USD. Instead of redeploying a fixed bb-a-USD pool using AAVE v2, Balancer Team chose to push for a new boosted pool (bb-e-USD) that deposited stables into Euler. 

At the same time, Temple Protocol was asked by the Balancer Team to switch our token pairing to Euler USD. Wanting to be a good ecosystem partner, we switched TEMPLE to pair against the new bb-e-USD which was subsequently affected in the Euler attack. Since trading was paused in the Euler USD pool, we have been unable to resume TEMPLE trading on Balancer nor reactivate RAMOS.

This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the new TEMPLE/DAI 50/50 weighted pool which will become TEMPLE’s primary LP once Euler restores lost funds to Temple. A new TEMPLE/DAI trading pair would bring significant TEMPLE trading volume to the Balancer platform. In the first two weeks of March before the Euler exploit occurred, the TEMPLE/bb-e-USD LP had generated over $800K in volume. Platform BAL incentives for the new pool would further enhance TEMPLE liquidity to facilitate more transaction volume.

TempleDAO plans to be active participants in Balancer governance as not only are we big fans of the technology, but also share a common vision of reducing price volatility, deep liquidity, and customizable asset exposure.

> GOVERNANCE:

TempleDAO current team has been almost entirely sourced from the community contributors. We started with a top-down nomination system for promotion and are currently in the early stages of implementing a Discord-integrated election system for promoting and demoting team members which will eventually lead to more decentralization.

> ORACLES:

TempleDAO does not rely on any external oracles. Prior to switching to Balancer, our custom Uni v2 AMM had handled over $300M in transaction volume without any issues. The intrinsic value backing per token against which the token price is indexed is coded into the contract: 0xae8a796bd9437Bd266664e8e9B8428B25A7D2477. 

Similarly, after deploying RAMOS to automatically manage the Balancer liquidity, our bot has rebalanced the pool dozens of times to enforce the TEMPLE price floor, which is also coded into the RAMOS contract: 0xa2eac1df5e89ca694c78626dd862d9398dbba6ef.

> AUDITS:

TempleDAO contracts have been fully audited by Peckshield. We also have a generous and on-going bug bounty system at hats.finance funded with $400K USD in TEMPLE rewards.

> CENTRALIZATION VECTORS:

The TEMPLE token is not upgradeable nor pausable.
The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract.
The community contributors behind the Temple protocol have shown the highest integrity and they have never abused their power, nor committed any actions that would harm the community nor DeFi at large.

> MARKET HISTORY:

TEMPLE initiated its token presale in October of 2021 and public trading began on its own custom AMM on December 19, 2021. It currently has strategic partnerships with major protocols like Convex, Yearn, Aura, Frax, and Balancer.

> VALUE STATEMENT AND CONCLUSION:

The TempleDAO Team has been a major adopter of Balancer technology. Our protocol has generated significant volume on the Balancer platform through TEMPLE swaps as well through our previous LBP events. TempleDAO has also been a significant revenue provider for veBAL and vlAURA holders by incentivizing emissions through Redacted Cartel’s Hidden Hand platform to accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool.

## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative
## Date: 2023-08-23
---


## Summary

This ARFC proposes an increase in the borrow rate of GHO from the current rate of 1.5% to 2.5%. The aim is to address the peg deviation of GHO and ensure its growth and trustworthiness in the market.


## Motivation

GHO has witnessed a rapid growth, reaching a circulating supply of 22M in just a few weeks since its launch. One of the primary reasons for this growth, especially in the current adverse market conditions, is the GHO borrow rate set below the market price of stablecoin borrows. This low rate, combined with the current lack of holding venues and the inability to use GHO as collateral, has made single-side liquidity provision in stableswaps, such as Balancer pools, [one of the most sought-after strategies.](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity)

While deep liquidity and growth are desired as a go-to-market strategy for GHO, the peg deviation of GHO (currently around $0.975) is affecting its growth and trust in the market. A consensus short-term solution to this issue is to slightly raise the GHO borrow rate from 1.5% to 2.5%. This rate remains attractive for borrowers and is still below the market average rates. However, by reducing the discount, it is anticipated to have a positive effect.

This proposal is particularly relevant in the context of the potential [sDAI onboarding integration](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sdai-aave-v3-onboarding/14410). This integration is expected to add short-term sell pressure on GHO, especially with the current borrow rate, which could further harm the GHO peg.

The discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.

## Specification

- **Asset**: GHO
- **Contract Address**: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f
- **Current Borrow Rate**: 1.5%
- **Proposed Borrow Rate**: 2.5%
- **New discounted Borrow Rate**: ~1.75%

## Disclamer

The Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this TEMP CHECK.

## Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.
3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, implement the proposed changes to the GHO borrow rate.

title: ARC - Update Risk Parameters Mainnet Arc Market
status: Proposed
author: @MatthewGraham, @ncitron, 3SE Holdings and UHOM
Created: 10/04/2022

----

# Simple Summary

This ARC proposes updating the mainnet Arc market Loan to Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold to be the same asset listed on mainnet V2 market, as determined by Gauntlet.

# Abstract

The risk parameters on the mainnet Arc market are currently not being maintained and are more conservative than those belonging to the same asset on mainnet V2 market. This proposal recommends updating the mainnet Arc market LTV parameter to match the LiquidationThreshold of the same asset listed on mainnet V2 market.

We intend to re-propose a quarterly update of the risk parameters for the mainnet Arc market quarterly in an attempt to keep both markets in sync with mainnet V2 market, or mainnet V3 once live.

# Motivation

This risk parameter change is targeting the following improvements on the Aave Arc Market:

* Align Risk Parameters - The risk parameters on Aave Arc market are currently more conservative and are in need of being updated to better reflect the mainnet V2 market and also the risk profile of the user.
* Improve UX - Increasing LTV ratios and reducing the Liquidity Penalty enables greater capital efficiency across the market.

Given the extra precaution shown when approving Borrowers on the Aave Arc Market, the recommendation is to amend the LTV to reflect the risk profiles of market participants. For now, the intent is to maintain the mainnet Arc market in line with the mainent V2 market on a quarterly basis.

# Specification

The below table shows the assets listed on the mainnet Arc market and their respective risk parameters on the mainnet Arc market.

69,"## Overview
HTD token (HeroesTD token) is the main token of HeroesTD GameFi project. After 2 years of developing, HeroesTD project has reached the maturity stage to launch on a massive scale. As a result, we are looking to expand our liquidity on Pancakeswap to increase the project visibility, liquidity usage, and reach more customers.
## Background
HeroesTD is a Play and Earn GameFi Tower Defense Game project. HeroesTD has been launched since 2021, and the product are being developed since then. Recently HeroesTD product have finally reached the stage where it is fully equipped as a Tower Defense game with NFT and tokens: All features are available including: Campaign, PvP, Coop, Tower of Skills, Clan, Friends; Referral feature is soon released;... 
HTD is the main token of HeroesTD project. Players can use HTD to create new NFTs (Summon), deposit NFT into game, participate in various exclusive ingame features such as Pros Mode, purchase Skins, purchase ingame items,... Players can also participate in the Ranking leaderboard and earn HTD based on the rank they reached each season. 
HTD token is listed mainly on Pancakeswap, and upgraded to V3 recently at the end of 2023. Listing on Pancakeswap is one of the key target of HTD as it allows players to have a fully DEX experience: full control on their liquidity, participate in staking, farming, etc... With the addition of Gauge, we believe it will bring more value to the HTD holders as all the volume will go through it, and increase the liquidity pool value. 
## Details

**Title:** [ARFC] Stablecoin Harmonization and Asset Parameters Optimization 
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-01-03

---
## Simple Summary

This ARFC proposes focusing stablecoin collateral usage on USDT and USDC while setting LTV to zero for less-trafficked stablecoins and long-tail assets. The objective is to minimize risk for the protocol, optimize revenue generation, and align with market demand trends.

## Motivation

Aave's revenue primarily comes from wETH borrowing and stablecoins borrowing. Years of User behavior data in DeFi indicates a low demand for fluctuating assets as collateral except in use-case-specific scenarios (LST/LRT loops for Weth, RPL borrow to deploy mini pools). Based on @ChaosLabs  [data](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Ethereum/listed-assets/), only 2.4%, 3.7%, and 5.8% of supplied DAI, USDT, and USDC on Ethereum are being utilized as collateral. We can also note that market demand for alternative stablecoins is less sensitive to borrow rates compared to blue-chip stablecoins like USDT and USDC.


The DAO governance has been lenient in onboarding some collaterals, such as KNC, which currently attracts nearly zero traction (currently used to generate 0.79$ of borrow volume) and generates minimal revenue. Additionally, the asymmetric risk presented by stablecoins, such as during the CRV event (collateral was USDC with very high LT and low LB), highlights the need for optimization considering Risk/reward.

## Specification

### Proposed Adjustments:

The ACI proposes the following strategy shift:

1. Focus on USDT and USDC as primary stablecoin collaterals.
2. Set LTV to zero for alternative stablecoins and long tail assets.
3. Enable a 3%/week LT reduction for these stablecoins assets, providing ample time for users to react and keep them as passive yield sources or borrowable assets that represent 99% of current user demand and most of protocol revenue.
4. Propose the following adjusted standardized ReserveFactor categories for Aave assets:

| Collateral Type | Reserve Factor % |
| --- | --- |
| wETH | 15% |
| USDC/USDT | 10% |
| Alternative stablecoins & long tail assets | 20% |
| DAI | 25% |

5. Fade out as collateral the following stablecoins: 

- FRAX
- LUSD
- EURS
- agEUR
- JEUR
- MAI

6. freeze (if not already), then slowly offboard the following alternative stablecoins and long-tail assets that failed to gain traction by gradually increasing RF to 99.9%, decreasing LT by 3% per week then applying incremental interestRateStrategies incentivizing users to switch to others collaterals or borrowed asset as the DAO implemented for BUSD and TUSD on Aave V2:

| Collateral Type          | Network      |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| EURS                    | All pools     |
| agEUR                   | All pools     |
| JEUR                    | All pools     |
| MAI                      | All pools    |
| KNC                     | Ethereum     |
| STG                     | Ethereum     |
| BAL                     | All pools    |
| FXS                     | Ethereum     |
| UNI                     | Ethereum     |
| WBTC.e                  | Avalanche      |


## Next Steps

1. Community feedback and gather consensus on the proposed adjustments.
2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.
3. If successful, escalate to AIP stage.

81,"#### ABSTRACT

Polygon Labs proposes that ApeCoin DAO launch and maintain its own zero-knowledge powered Layer-2 (“zk-L2”) with the Polygon Chain Development Kit (“CDK”) to accelerate the growth and development of the ApeCoin ecosystem.

This proposal includes (1) the launch of a dedicated ApeCoin zk-L2 chain (“ApeChain”) built and maintained by Gateway.fm, a premier rollup as a service (“RaaS”) provider that builds Web3 infrastructure and tooling products with advisory support from Polygon Labs and oversight of such building and maintenance to be conducted by the ApeCoin DAO Foundation and (2) ecosystem collaboration with Polygon Labs to help stimulate the growth of ApeCoin-integrated projects (experiences, entertainment, games and consumer applications) and ApeChain-related public goods (middleware, marketplaces, and necessary infrastructure).

As contemplated under “Gateway.fm as RaaS Provider and Architecture Considerations” below, ApeChain will be fully owned, governed and run under the patronage of the ApeCoin DAO community with 100% of all revenue, including sequencer fees or any potential Native Yield (defined below), accruing to the ApeCoin DAO and ApeCoin Validators (defined below). No AIP Idea is inherently linked to this AIP and all AIP Ideas–design architecture or otherwise–not explicitly covered within this AIP (e.g., a separate “ApeChain token” launch/airdrop or a development fund from the ApeCoin DAO treasury to help stimulate the growth of ApeCoin-integrated projects and ApeChain-related public goods) is not precluded from this ApeChain implementation but instead is left to the community (e.g., through subsequent AIPs by ApeCoin community members) even in cases where Polygon Labs does not believe it would be in the best interests of APE holders.

  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/2/2e6b946844041736a2fee1f03c4bd247f683c501_2_1248x786.png)

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

The ApeCoin community has been aware that ApeCoin “will need to migrate to its own chain in order to properly scale” since these very words were [tweeted by Yuga Labs](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1520612362986078208?s=20&t=-NhsBR93IH1LJp6ZYfcDdA) nearly 18 months ago. Indeed, Yuga Labs went on to “encourage the [ApeCoin] DAO to start thinking in this direction.” While ApeCoin DAO voted on [AIP-41](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-41-keep-apecoin-within-the-ethereum-ecosystem-process/5664/2) to keep ApeCoin within the Ethereum ecosystem, the question of an ApeCoin-specific chain is open and remains ripe for decision.

Here’s where this AIP comes in: to propose a dedicated ApeChain, using Polygon [CDK](https://polygon.technology/polygon-cdk), an open source toolset developers can use to launch their own zk-powered L2 on Ethereum with little friction and an emphasis on modularity, built and maintained by Gateway.fm with advisory support from Polygon Labs and oversight by the ApeCoin DAO Foundation.

As detailed below under “Platforms and Technologies,” ApeChain will provide ApeCoin DAO and its members potential sequencer fees and staking rewards for network validators while solving the scaling issue mentioned above. In other words, this chain will provide dedicated, ultra-premium and inexpensive blockspace for ApeCoin DAO-affiliated and/or -incubated experiences, entertainment, games and consumer applications that will ultimately bring not only more users into the ApeCoin ecosystem, but also additional activity and creation of all types of value (content, assets, data and the like).

Polygon CDK has seen great adoption already. Chains being developed using Polygon CDK and core contributors thereto include X1 (built by OKX), Immutable zkEVM, NEAR zkWASM, Gnosis Pay, Capx, Palm Network, Astar zkEVM, Canto and Celestia (for data availability), among others. This is because Polygon CDK offers the highest degree of flexibility in scaling Ethereum while also remaining maximally secure.

ApeCoin DAO's [stated mission](https://apecoin.com/about) is to “empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3.” Via $APE, ApeCoin DAO will build and support “a decentralized protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse.""

ApeChain will provide the ApeCoin DAO with an efficient and secure execution environment upon which ApeCoin DAO projects can be built to help realize this mission. As a result, by virtue of ApeCoin DAO gaining composability and interoperability with the entire modular suite of Polygon solutions (including Polygon PoS, which will [soon be upgraded to a zkEVM Validium](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-upgrading-polygon-pos-to-a-zkevm-validium/12187?utm_campaign=Polygon+2.0&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=73083564&utm_content=73083564&utm_source=hs_email), Polygon zkEVM, Polygon Miden and various customizable L2 permutations using the CDK, together “**Polygon Architecture**”), the ApeCoin ecosystem will be primed for tremendous growth.

With thousands of dApps and millions of daily transactions, the Polygon Architecture is by far the most robust and stable Ethereum L2 scaling solution. With ApeCoin already bridged onto Polygon PoS, it is already available to be used by all dApps across Polygon Architecture – including for gas and staking in relation to dApps built on the proposed ApeChain (see “Platforms and Technologies” below).

It is [well-documented](https://decrypt.co/117671/decrypts-2022-crypto-project-of-the-year-polygon) that mainstream adoption of blockchain technology and Web3 is underway, and the Polygon Architecture is helping to bring blockchain to “Internet-scale.” This is across verticals and use cases, including gaming (Square Enix), loyalty rewards (Starbucks), phygital goods and co-creation (Nike), digital avatars (Reddit), self-expression and identity (L’Oreal) and the most adopted Web3-native use cases (from defi, like Uniswap and Aave, to the open metaverse, like Sandbox and Decentraland). As such, the Polygon Architecture is the most well-suited ecosystem for ApeCoin DAO to launch “community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse” and Polygon Labs is the most well-suited entity to help ApeCoin DAO to stimulate the growth of ApeCoin-integrated projects and ApeChain-related public goods.

#### OVERALL COST

As laid out in the preceding sections of this AIP, we estimate that the costs for building, deploying and maintaining ApeChain for one year, will be a maximum of $200,000 USD. None of these expenses would be paid to Polygon Labs or any affiliate of Polygon Labs. Instead, they would be used to pay Gateway.fm and its infrastructure costs.

Once ApeChain is built, deployed and maintained, the DAO (as a self-governing entity) will decide for itself how it will fund and maintain ApeChain in subsequent years. Possibilities include negotiating with the Gateway.fm on a contract extension or fielding proposals from community members with sufficient expertise who are willing to contribute to ApeChain’s maintenance, for example.

82,"This vote is being submitted by the Venus Community on behalf of Polygon Labs in response to their proposal submitted to the Venus Community Forum on August 1st 2023. 

Introduction

The community of Venus Protocol has made significant strides since their inception in 2020, successfully lowering the entry barrier for millions of users worldwide and positioning themselves as one of the most widely utilized decentralized applications in web3.

To continue pushing the envelope of DeFi’s potential, we propose that the Venus Money Mark Protocol be deployed on Polygon zkEVM. This deployment will provide a synergy between Venus Protocol and Polygon zkEVM, a scalable Layer 2 protocol, potentially enhancing the user experience and risk management features for Venus’ growing community.

Additionally, given the close relationship between PancakeSwap and Venus, we’re excited to continue supporting one of the largest pairs of partners in DeFi.

Rationale

We believe this is the right moment for Venus to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons:

Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility.
Polygon zkEVM is an Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.

The Polygon ecosystem is aligned with Ethereum and its values.
LayerZero has deployed their endpoint on Polygon zkEVM, in line with the Omnichain Money Market 5 post for cross-chain expansion on Venus.
The migration to Polygon zkEVM would not only capitalize on the compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts but also benefit from the scalability features offered by Polygon’s zkEVM.

Polygon zkEVM, an open-source ZK-Rollup, delivers a hassle-free user experience withEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It flawlessly integrates with pre-existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets. Leveraging the strength of ZK proofs, Polygon zkEVM significantly reduces transaction expenses and substantially boosts transaction speed, while also adopting Ethereum’s robust security. The Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta was successfully launched on March 27, 2023.

Benefits

*Listing assets on Polygon zkEVM within Venus isolated pools to further enhance protocol and asset use-cases.

*Multi-chain expansion into the Polygon ecosystem introduces the successful Venus protocol to a completely new set of Ethereum-adjacent builders.

*Enhanced User Experience: Leveraging the Polygon zkEVM can minimize user and developer friction and provide a smoother, more seamless experience.

*Risk Management: Venus’s isolated pools feature and Polygon zkEVM’s verifiable zero-knowledge proofs can further bolster the protocol’s security and risk management capabilities.

Incentives

To help bootstrap Venus’ growth on Polygon zkEVM, we will provide a $100,000 MATIC grant, with the aim of user acquisition.

Additionally, we will provide additional incentives for Venus’ continued growth on Polygon zkEVM:

$50k at $10m TVL
$50k at $25m TVL

Finally, the core DeFi BD team at Polygon Labs will work closely with the Venus team to:

*Co-Market Venus’ launch on Polygon zkEVM

*Connect Venus to the large ecosystem of Polygon-based builders who are eager to work with the money market

*Work closely with Venus on any questions around launch across developer, business development, and project support.

Proposal:
Deploy Venus Protocol on Polygon zkEVM:
Deployment on Polygon zkEVM, Venus will also get the opportunity to get the added advantages of the Polygon Ecosystem, ranging from not only business development support of Polygon Labs, but also community expansion, marketing support, chance to participate in an ecosystem with more than 50000 dAPPs, and support from the best product and solutions engineering team in crypto industry.

Legal

The legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as “Polygon Labs”.

Conflict of Interest Declaration

There are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Venus's legal entities, including Venus, Venus tokens, nor investments of Venus.

Risk Profile

Deploying on Polygon zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer 2 protocol, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereum’s core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens.

84,"I propose a vote to make the syrup pools last longer. 

As you can see, once that GMT Syrup pool runs out we are going to be in a lot of trouble with not having any syrup pools.  23,000,000 CAKE is staked in that one Syrup Pool. 

I purpose to make the Syrup Pools last 120 Days at half the current APR%.  Make the Syrup Pools Pay out Slower. 

 
 We could even go as far as making them last 180Days and payout 66% slower.  

The APRs of the Syrup Pools would be 30% - 40%, but the Syrup pools will last longer. This will give more projects time to launch on Pancakeswap and for current projects to add more tokens to extend their Syrup Pools.  

It will also help investors not worry about dumping their Cake when big pools like the GMT are going to expire.",neutral

86,"### Motivation

As we near the start of vlAURA voting the possibility of using a single snapshot space has been [discussed](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/snapshot-proposal-config-change-to-support-aggregated-voters/3049/7). This would simplify things significantly compared to Aura running their own snapshot then transferring the results into Balancer’s. The Aura team has graciously designed the [necessary strategy](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/pull/657) so all that is left is to add this strategy to Balancer’s snapshot. This will allow vlAURA holders to vote with weight proportional to the veBAL held by Aura.

In combination with this and the expected increase in veBAL supply coinciding with Aura’s launch I also propose raising the quorum from 100k veBAL to 200k veBAL. This number may need to be increased even further and should be reassessed after a new baseline is established over the next couple of months. Additionally, we have implemented a new policy of only passing transactions to the DAO Multisig for signatures once a week on Tuesday. This is intended to reduce the frequency of signing requests. Given the three day voting window, we will now aim to bundle proposals together for simultaneous vote once a week on Thursdays. Any successful proposals that require DAO Multisig execution would be initiated for signing that Tuesday.

Finally, control over the balancer.eth ENS will also be passed to the DAO Multisig. Before that is done, snapshot admin will be set to the [Emergency subDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x63fab7ab9ef5b9579dabb82058b8ea309e39c766d435438b55fff8db7c1f69fd) Multisig `0xA29F61256e948F3FB707b4b3B138C5cCb9EF9888`. After this proposal any future updates to snapshot would be handled by the Emergency subDAO.

### Risks

* Time sensitive proposals like BIP-6 where user funds are involved could be needlessly delayed. Thus, there is an exception for any proposal considered time sensitive or emergency in nature - these proposals may go to a vote on any day of the week and be passed to the DAO Multisig immediately upon a successful vote.
* We may fail to hit the new quorum in the next few votes. This risk must be considered by the community against the value of a higher quorum. Aura causing a big increase in veBAL supply may not translate into vlAURA holders actively participating in governance.

### Specification

If approved, the following will be in effect:

* The Balancer team will add the strategy created by the Aura team to Balancer’s snapshot. Then snapshot admin will be set to the Emergency subDAO Multisig `0xA29F61256e948F3FB707b4b3B138C5cCb9EF9888`
* Ownership of Balancer.eth ENS will be given to the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`
* The quorum on snapshot will be increased to 200,000 veBAL
* Most proposals will only be eligible to go to a vote on Thursdays
* Most proposals requiring execution by the DAO Multisig will only be initiated on Tuesdays",bearish

88,"# December 2022 CAKE Emission Reduction

The last CAKE emission reduction was done in August, and we know CAKE emissions continue to be one of the most discussed topics in the community. As our goal is still for CAKE to become **emission neutral or deflationary** over the longer term, i.e. **ultrasound CAKE**, we wish to continue the conversation with our community, and hear your thoughts.

As illustrated in this graphic, we are on track to **ultrasound CAKE**, and with the different options, we hope to get even closer!


![](https://imgur.com/pxINFav.png)


**As per the previous Syrup Pool adjustment, we will be proposing some options with regard to the ***Syrup Pool emissions***, not the Farm Rewards emissions.**

## Read before voting

Before you vote, please make sure you understand the impact of the long and short term effects of CAKE emissions changes on our tokenomics.

1️⃣ Read and digest the [**CAKE Tokenomics documentation**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics)   

2️⃣ Read this proposal in full;  

3️⃣ Make up your mind, and cast your vote!  


#### Why reduce Pool emissions again?

The end goal of reducing emissions is to make CAKE “emission neutral” or “deflationary, i.e. “ultrasound CAKE”. That means, on average, the amount of CAKE burnt per block will be more than the amount of CAKE minted.

Since the last August Pool emissions reduction, we have observed the following:

1️⃣ Token prices have generally been impacted by the bear market, but CAKE price and staking yield have held up relatively well compared to the broader market and other DEXs.

2️⃣ PancakeSwap has completed and launched several of its Q3 and Q4 roadmap items (Aptos multichain launch, Ethereum multichain launch, Stableswap on BNB Chain), successfully redirected some of the proposed Syrup Pool emissions to farms on other chains and products. 

3️⃣ However, with general crypto activity slowing in recent months, we have not been able to redirect as much CAKE emissions as we had initially planned for. 

4️⃣ For the current Ethereum and Aptos farms, the redirected emissions from Syrup Pool is approximately 0.09 CAKE/block, with more redirected emissions expected as new farms and pools are launched on these chains.

Therefore, we propose to reduce Syrup Pool emissions while still ensuring competitive yields for long-term CAKE stakers.

#### Example of Adjustment

Based on data extracted in mid-December 2022, a rough gauge of the impact of the pools emissions reduction is as follows:

| Emissions towards CAKE Pool | 8.91     | 8.41   | 7.91    | 7.66      |
|:---------------------------|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Flexible Staking Pool       | 2.76%  | 2.60%  | 2.45%  | 2.37%  |
| Fixed-Term Staking Pool (Avg.)     | 47.60% | 44.97% | 42.29% | 40.96% |
| Fixed-Term Staking Pool (52W Lock.)     | 57.86% | 54.67% | 51.42% | 49.79% |

This is still highly competitive compared to single-staking token rewards for comparable DeFi DApps:

| DEX | Single-Staking APR Annualized (%)| Details
|:---------------------------|:------:|:------:|
| Curve       | 1.39%  |Assuming one-year stake |
| Uniswap       | n.a.  | n.a.  |
| SushiSwap       | 10.55%  |  –  |


#### Adjustment Options

CAKE holders can vote for any one of these options at the bottom of this page.

### ❌ No change:

- **~8.91 CAKE** per block go to Syrup Pools
- Total emissions: **11.16 CAKE** per block (including Farms)
    
### 🔥 0.50 CAKE per block reduction (4.5%) to Syrup Pools rewards:

- **~8.41 CAKE** per block go to Syrup Pools
- Total emissions: **10.66 CAKE** per block (including Farms)

### 🔥🔥 1.00 CAKE per block reduction (9.0%) to Syrup Pools rewards:

- **~7.91 CAKE** per block go to Syrup Pools
- Total emissions: **10.16** CAKE per block (including Farms)

### 🔥🔥🔥 1.25 CAKE per block (11.2%) reduction to Syrup Pools rewards:

- **~7.66 CAKE** per block go to Syrup Pools
- Total emissions: **9.91 CAKE** per block (including Farms)

#### ⚠️Please note⚠️

One option must have a majority of 50%+ at the end snapshot in order to win the vote and be executed. If none of the options get over 50% of the vote, we'll create a new proposal.",neutral

91,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z consumers via extremely popular and influential social media personalities on Instagram, Tik Tok, and Youtuber. The goal is to create awareness within the normies and introduce them to the Bored Ape Yacht Club as the best club in the world despite not having a club or any yachts, and that ApeCoin is the future of finance that will lead to financial freedom despite not having any utility or real world use cases.

By Achieving this goal we hope to increase demand for Apes and get hundreds or maybe even thousands of normies to come buy our bags. If we can convince them into truly believing that Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin are cool, we hope they will buy them to be a part of this great community with no interest of ever selling for a profit, resulting in an increased holder count. This can potentially get Apes out of the hands of Blur farmers and traders who only buy Apes to flip them for a 0.01 eth profit (or loss).
MAGA - Make Apes Great Again

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Increased holder count… This may or may not bring in a few thousand new ApeCoin bag holders.
New community members and DAO participants… We may or may not get a few thousand new plebs to complain about how down bad they are.

More hate and ridicule… We may get a bunch of people to make fun of and talk bad about Apes. But there’s no such thing as bad publicity right? Whether the things they say are good or bad they will be talking about us.

The idea is to convince the normies that Apes are cool and they need to be like us. To make them realize that the Bored Ape Yacht Club is the best club in the world and they need to join this club asap before they can no longer afford to join.

The only way to find out if it works is to FAFO. The more we FA, the more we FO. If we don’t FA, we’ll never FO.

The one benefit I can guarantee for sure is that 1000 community members will get to claim a free Twisted Ape Treasure Chest. I have 1000 of these Treasure Chests in stock and ready to ship. They are currently priced at 69 $APE, but if this AIP is approved, I will make them a free claim to the first 1000 wallets that vote on this AIP, regardless whether they vote yes or no.

We will also include delegated voters. If you delegate your votes to another wallet or are part of a sub community that votes separately such as Surreal or Mocaverse, our dev team will get all your wallet addresses from the snapshot and include you in the free claim.

I will post the winners of these Chests here on the forum as well as on X and Discord. I will ensure everyone finds out about it by making public announcements on as many Twitter spaces as I can get on. We will not request any personal information directly, however the claim will be made on our Shopify website with the standard checkout process similar to every other ecommerce store on Shopify. So mailing addresses will be as safe as they usually are as with any other order users place online.

If there are less than 1000 voters and delegates and we have some leftover Treasure Chests, then we will make them available for free to all ApeCoin holders via a random raffle system.

94,"# Summary
1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.

# Motivations
Launched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):

Total trading volume: $160B
Total swaps: 5.91M
Total users: 1.25M

1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.

The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.

In December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.

# Benefits to Aave Community

1INCH is highly liquid.
1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.
1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.
1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.

# Specification
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
RoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3

3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.

1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.

1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.

On the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

The 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.

1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.

1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.

P2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.
1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.

Supported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.

# How is the asset currently used?

1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3

#Emission schedule

The 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.

Of the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).

Uncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).

# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability

The smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.

The 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.

## General

The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.

* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.
* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.
* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.
  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.
  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.
  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.

The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.

## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:

The 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M

The 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.

The 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.

On April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.

96,"## Summary
A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V2 ETH.

## Abstract

Many interest rate curves on Aave have not changed for a long time and, in the case of some assets, have never been updated for the lifetime of the asset listing. Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet has evaluated assets on Aave and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. 


## Motivation

Among other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve:

1. mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool
2. build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future

**Summary:**

> Due to the recent [vulnerability disclosure](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345), the deployment of the [WeightedPoolFactory-v3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5dd94da3644ddd055fcf6b3e1aa310bb7801eb8b#readContract) is configured to address the potential issues related to Balancer’s previous weighted pools (v2). Tessera Boosted Ape is a unique use case where boosted/linear pools are a perfect fit to increase capital efficiency for LPs and traders. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.

> • [Tessera](https://ape.tessera.co/)

**Protocol Description:**

> wstETH is liquid staked ETH. Tessera Staked Ape's reward vault for the APE token.

**Motivation:**

> Balancer already has significant wstETH liquidity and this pool is regularly our #1 contributor to protocol fees. The goal with this pool is to stimulate additional trading activity with wstETH, thus making our pile of wstETH liquidity even more valuable to the protocol. APE being a somewhat volatile asset will be likely to create good returns for LPs while earning them yield in addition. 

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** Find more information about Ape's governance [here](https://apecoin.com/governance).
2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on a rate provider for wstETH which Balancer has been using already for awhile. See [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768). The linear pool is it's own rate provider. 
3. **Audits:** See wstETH [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits). [APE](https://apecoin.com/about), [stkAPE](https://ape.tessera.co/). 
4. **Centralization vectors:** See [here ](https://lido.fi/faq) for information on wstETH. See audit links for information on APE. 
5. **Market History:** See APE [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apecoin).
6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on wstETH yield. Tessera offers a unique opportunity for Balancer to become a liquidity source and tap into the yield provided on the APE asset as well. By paring with wstETH we also encourage more wstETH trading activity and since wstETH/ETH is one of our largest pools, any increase in trading activity will make wstETH liquidity even more profitable for us.

99,"Would you like to have 100% protection against volatility for your crypto?? This could be done using the new Concentrated Liquidity of v3 by just changing or adding a few things! 

Imagine adding liquidity to the ETH/USDC pair for example (50% of each), and in case the ETH price drops and gets out of your range, your capital is turned 100% into USDC!! This way you would be 100% PROTECTED against LOSSES! And in case the ETH price goes up again and completely crosses your range in an upward direction, your capital would be automatically swaped 100% into ETH!!

You could even manually FOLLOW or TRAIL the ETH price every time it goes up, by removing and adding a new liquidity range at a higher price, and this could help you MAXIMIZE YOUR PROFITS!! You could very efficiently trade tops like this! Just imagine trading perfectly the ETH TOP of this Bull market! Either if it is 10k, 15k, or 20k, you could just follow it and trade it perfectly!! And after it drops, you can continue to follow the price, GROWING YOUR CAPITAL thanks to a high yield from fees, and volatility itself! Knowing your capital is always completely PROTECTED against ANY LOSSES!!

The problem now is that the direction of the swaps inside a liquidity range are exactly the opposite as they should be... Using the same example, if the ETH price drops out of your range, your capital is swaped 100% into ETH, and if the price goes up and gets out of the range, your capital is 100% swaped into USDC... It should be the exact opposite!

So this is a PROPOSAL to change the direction the swaps are made inside a liquidity range to the exact opposite they are now, or to at least let the users choose the direction of the swaps when they add liquidity to the pools or create ranged orders.

If we make this change, it would be DISRUPTIVE and Uniswap will completely BREAK all other DEXs and CEXs!! People would LOOSE the FEAR of loosing their money because of volatility!! This would easily help with crypto's mass adoption!! And it will definitely drive more LPs to v3!! Please think about it and support this proposal! Thanks!!",neutral

As outlined in the [updated whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the DOUGH capTier from `cap1` to `cap2` ($1M -> $3M).

# The Proposal
The total adjusted liquidity of DOUGH has reached almost $5M, well over the imposed cap of $1M. The cap should be raised in order to distribute a more equal share of BAL tokens to DOUGH pools via liquidity mining.

# What is DOUGH?
DOUGH is the governance token of PieDAO, a creator of tokenized ETFs which was among the earliest builders of Balancer smart pools. DOUGH is the building block of the DAO. Owning DOUGH makes you a part of the organisation, giving voting rights in all decisions. It’s not just about governance, DOUGH holders are also entitled to a revenue stream from fees generated by the protocol.",bearish

>
> The objective of this proposal is to enable this pool to be eligible for BAL incentive distribution, thereby enhancing liquidity on Balancer. This will facilitate users in swapping mevETH, an Liquid Staking Asset, and FOLD, Manifold's governance token. The pool includes a rate provider for mevETH and therefore requests to be made a core pool.

**Protocol Description:**

> The MEV Protocol is a collaborative innovation designed to revolutionize Ethereum’s network security and decentralization. It is forged by the pioneers of the first ETH staking service and notable figures in Ethereum infrastructure. The protocol introduces mevETH, a Liquid Staking Token (LST), aimed at optimizing value for validators.

>
>
> Transparency and fairness in block validation are offered through a variety of options, allowing validators to decide who receives the rights to their blocks. The protocol recognizes that such crucial decisions should not be monopolized by a single organization in private.

102,"### Service Provider Name & Overview

 The Balancer Maxis are a passionate group of Balancer community contributors. A center of excellence that keeps the Balancer ecosystem operating at a first class level. As the protocol grows, this team's responsibilities will likely grow with it. We have picked up maintenance tasks from other organizations in the Balancer ecosystem as it continues to decentralize and would expect this to continue (see examples below).

### Leader(s)

Solarcurve - joined by Zekraken, Mike B, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, and Danko8383.

**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct (or link to your own)**: Yes

**Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines:** Yes

### Domains of Operation

*Multisig Management*

* Linear (boosted) pool settings
* Swap fee and amplification adjustments
* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL
* Adding new reward tokens to gauges
* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees
* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig

**Expertise:** Besides setting swap fees, this group has done all these tasks from day 1. Soon after we took control of swap fees from our friends at Gauntlet, the protocol broke the previous record of 24h fees earned. We believe our track record justifies our continued management of these multisigs until such time as governance approves another SP to take them over.

*Governance*

* We serve on the [Governance Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp/2324) and ensure continuity of Balancer’s Governance Process
* Active participants in discord and the forum on governance topics
* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)
* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process
* Manage admin of the Governance forum
* We will pursue various strategic initiatives, either individually or as a group, at our discretion such as deploying to Optimism or the new Operating Framework
* In the cases that voting power in other protocols from tokens held in Balancer’s Treasury has been delegated to us, we will represent Balancer’s interest in these votes.

**Expertise:** We helped to design Balancer’s governance system and are very active users of it. It is safe to say our group has the strongest working knowledge of Balancer’s governance system outside of Balancer Labs. For now it does require active management to ensure votes are carried out in an orderly fashion then properly executed. We believe our track record here again speaks for itself and we will continue to operate in the same fashion we have been until governance approves a new governance framework or approves another SP to take these tasks over.

*User/project support*

* We manage Balancer’s discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed
* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions
* We often deploy new pools for other projects
* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists
* We help with UI testing for Balancer

**Expertise:** If you come to discord we’ll likely be the ones helping you out. We are also spread out in many chats with projects offering advice and performing routine necessary tasks as described above. It is safe to say almost all projects that have used Balancer over the last year have spoken to one of us at some point. We will continue to operate in this support capacity and offer any assistance we can to the community and the efforts of other SP’s.

*Community*

* We manage a Coordinape circle open to all DAO contributors
* Onboarding framework for new contributors
* Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO, or between SPs
* Regular health-check on SP and community contributors with recurrent feedback

**Expertise:** These initiatives were pioneered by some of our members over the last six months. We will continue iterating and exploring these both with our in house knowledge but also in collaboration with the broader community.

*Record Keeping*

* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.
* Maintaining, updating, and improving official Balancer documentation as a bridge between the greater community and core development team.

### Key Objectives & Success Metrics

*Multisig Management*

* Transactions are vetted for accuracy and executed in a timely manner
* Public discord channels are used for swap fee discussion so the community can provide input and feedback.

*Governance*

* Balancer’s Governance system continues to operate in a fair and transparent manner.
* We will continue being very active participants and leaders

*User/project support*

* Discord/telegram chat questions will be answered in a timely manner

*Community*

* Coordinape will pay out promptly each month
* We will act as a touch point for any interested contributors to Balancer DAO

*Global*

* We commit to undertake all activities in public where reasonable. We aim to responsibly grow the Balancer Maxis and this can only be done when the community is able to interact and engage with us. There must be more opportunities for this in the future.
* We will continue to facilitate the weekly Treasury meeting (Tuesday 11am EST in discord) open to the public. This is a good opportunity for anyone in the community to talk to us about the Treasury or any other relevant topic.
* We will facilitate a monthly community call where all SP’s are welcome to join for their monthly updates. This eases the burden on the community to attend many calls. Again, optional participation by other SP’s.

### Length of Engagement & Budget:

3 months.

Budget of 6,875 BAL per month for salaries (1,250 per person, Danko at 625) which will be max locked in veBAL by contributors. Additional monthly allocations of 100 BAL for gas costs and 4,000 BAL for Coordinape.

**Total for 3 month engagement:** 32,925 BAL

**Impact on the Treasury**: The Treasury currently holds ~4M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis would cost less than 1% of the treasury’s BAL holdings.

**ETH Address to Receive Funds**: 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325

**Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation):** N/A

*As a final note, if this proposal passes Zen Dragon will be replacing mkflow on the Governance Council as he voluntarily steps away and into other roles in the ecosystem. We thank him for his service. The members of the council will now be Solarcurve, Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, and Zen Dragon.*",bullish

Discussion: https://gov.curve.fi/t/request-for-feedback-options-for-tbtc-pools/841

The tBTC team proposes adding a tBTC/wBTC or tBTC/[renBTC/sBTC/wBTC] pool. Adding a tBTC pool will further increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum and make it easier to swap between assets.

Abstract

tBTC is a Bitcoin sidechain on Ethereum, built to give Bitcoin the capabilities of Ethereum and bring additional collateral to DeFi. The asset (TBTC) is an ERC-20 pegged to Bitcoin, it can be minted or redeemed for BTC by anyone and without intermediaries. Instead of relying on a single custodian like wBTC or federation of custodians like Liquid, tBTC is supported by a decentralized bonded multi-federated peg model using ECDSA technology.

tBTC is built on the Keep Network, and as of launching this week already has 24.21M USD locked in the network (22.69M USD in KEEP, 1.39M USD in ETH and 0.26M USD in BTC). We’ve decided to launch slowly and safely with a 9 week graduated cap, currently the cap is at 100 BTC but will rise to 250 later this week. [See the full schedule here](https://blog.keep.network/tbtc-the-safe-way-to-use-bitcoin-in-defi-is-live-on-tbtc-network-de2bb8b6eaf7). Future plans for tBTC include pointing at least 5% of the KEEP supply at various liquidity rewards.

Motivation

With several BTC on Ethereum choices out there, the tBTC team wants to gauge the Curve community’s appetite for a tBTC pool. Our team’s initial thought was to keep it simple with a tBTC/wBTC pool, but are also interested in hearing about interest in something like a tBTC/[renBTC/wBTC/sBTC] pool.

Please vote below or submit options for other assets you’d like to see in a pool.

Specification

The tBTC contracts just went live: https://etherscan.io/token/0x8dAEBADE922dF735c38C80C7eBD708Af50815fAa

tBTC is fully open source and has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence, Sergei Delgado (an independent BTC researcher) and Trail of Bits. [See audit details](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc#security)

## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. In addition, we propose freezing the KNCL reserve.


## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.


## Specification

The recent market downturn on the weekend of December 4th led to the most liquidations on both centralized exchanges and in liquidity protocols in the recent past. Most liquidations on the Aave protocol happened between 4:30 and 5:45 UTC when the price of ETH dropped nearly 13%. Below is a graph of liquidation by collateral and repay asset.
![Liquidations by collateral and repay asset](https://i.imgur.com/gDTtU13.png)
Although volatility for assets is slightly higher, the abundance of liquidity and active market participants is a positive sign for the health of Aave! For example, the total value of CRV (curve dao token) liquidated was large compared to the total collateral used on Aave. Lower LTV, lower liquidation threshold, and higher liquidation bonus protect the protocol from insolvencies. However, multiple liquidations of over 400,000 USD occured in quick succession. This shows ample liquidity for liquidators even in times of high network congestion. These market events provide important data points for measuring tail risk.

For reference, previous analysis of liquidations on Aave from May 2021 can be found here: https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/aave-protocol-liquidation-retrospective-may-2021-67c655fc1b31

Although some assets currently have higher volatility, our analysis shows that it is safe to increase borrowing parameters and decrease liquidation bonus values. Our simulations study price drops and network congestion more extreme than was seen last week, and slippage and liquidity considerations have improved.

**Freezing KNCL**
The KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://www.notion.so/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://www.notion.so/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.

Considering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.

113,"maybe,it  have   fail",bearish
114,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-dao-wave-2/2275).

This draft has been created by the committee of the Balancer Grants DAO. See its previous proposal for establishing this committee [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-establish-the-balancer-grants-dao-and-coordinate-the-next-wave-of-balancer-community-grants/2095).

## Summary
This proposal aims to fund the next cycle (Nov 1st - January 31st) of Balancer Grants DAO. The upcoming program will further accelerate the development of the Balancer ecosystem by improving coordination around Grants, RFPs and Ventures.

The requested budget for this next cycle (3 months) is 50,000 BAL. Similar to the first Balancer Grants DAO proposal, a learnings and review end report will be created at the end of the cycle, and any unspent resources will be sent back to the BAL treasury.

The Balancer Grants committee has already worked together during the first 3 month’s cycle. To maintain continuity and support for the grants that are still running, and the applicants that have applied, we want to have the proposal for the next cycle up and ready on time. The first round has been a success and shows the need and the potential for a bigger Balancer Ecosystem. To get a better idea of what has been done, check out our monthly reports on the [Balancer Community Notion](https://balancergrants.notion.site/Grants-Updates-404ae3750a084de78116cb899b17e2b9). An end report for cycle 1 is being finalized and will be published at the end of the current cycle, which is running until the 31st of October.

From the beginning we have looked at this first round as a time of learning and iterating, building on what works and leaving behind what is useless. With this in mind, the committee requested a lower amount than is often given to grant programs within the crypto space. Now that the committee and the Balancer community is aware of these learning points, the following rounds will no doubt go even smoother than this round already went.

## Impact
Looking back on the first cycle, we can say with confidence that the program has been a success. The program has been able to pull in multiple promising and established DeFi projects into the Balancer Ecosystem. To build long term relationships and grow Balancer’s TVL were the main objectives, and the program is clearly delivering. We as a committee have identified multiple opportunities when it comes to ecosystem building and want to act upon these in the next cycle.

Establishing well-aligned yet autonomous units within the Balancer Ecosystem aligns with Balancer’s Decentralization and Ecosystem strategy. Having multiple entities co-develop the Balancer ecosystem creates value-add opportunities and allows the separate entities to specialize further.

## PROPOSAL
We propose some small changes to the current setup of the grants program, and advocate to further the decentralization of the BalancerDAO. We believe this can be done through multiple committees, initially funded by the Balancer Grants DAO. We understand that this is a slow and long process, so this will be a learning experience where we want to plant the seeds for the future.

The grant program provides support and funding ($5K - USD $75K, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem.

The RFP (bounty) program provides rewards for completion of key tasks identified by the Balancer community. It’s the easiest way for anyone to contribute to the Balancer ecosystem. RFPs can be either technical or non-technical and vary in reward size depending on the required skill set and time needed to complete.

The venture program aims to expand the Balancer ecosystem and further align incentives with ecosystem partners through partnership agreements, token swaps and DAO2DAO ventures. We propose to start this off with a Venture Lead role who will be actively building out these types of deals and structures. With the actual outcomes going to the forum and being voted upon by the community. To support this opportunity, it needs some firepower and a dedicated role plus support can bring that.

The end-goal of the complete program is to attract and retain talent and resources to the Balancer ecosystem.

115,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-gauntlet-and-the-ballers-multisig-to-manage-pool-parameters/2400).

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable Gauntlet and a multisig controlled by Ballers to control certain parameters of the Boosted Pools so as to increase their capital efficiency and returns to liquidity providers.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) contain a series of parameters that affect their efficiency and can be tuned depending on market conditions:

* Boosted Stable Pools ( `StablePhantomPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * amplification parameter
  * token rate cache duration
* Boosted Linear Pools ( `AaveLinearPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * lower target
  * upper target

Gauntlet has been managing fees and amplification factor in weighted and stable pools, and would be able to do so for Boosted Stable Pools if this proposal is approved by the community.

The duration of the token rate cache can have an impact on a boosted pool’s capital efficiency. If the duration is too long, the pool can be arbed for all the interest accrued on Aave since the last update of the cache. A short duration mitigates this risk, with the downside of increasing gas costs for trades.

On Linear Pools, swap fees are not collected by liquidity providers, but rather act as an incentive for arbitragers/keepers to:

1. withdraw main tokens from the pool, deposit them in Aave and deposit the aTokens in the pool when it has main tokens in excess;
2. withdraw aTokens from the pool, withdraw the underlying from Aave and deposit the main token to the pool when it has a low balance of main tokens;

The lower and upper targets determine a range within which no fee in imposed on trades between main tokens and Aave tokens. A trader moving the balance of main tokens away from this range pays a fee to the pool, which the pool then returns to traders that move the balance back towards the range.

While we’re confident that Gauntlet can hit the ground running with respect to optimizing the swap fee and amplification factor of Boosted Stable Pools, there’s still much to be learned when it comes to the other four parameters described above. For this reason, this proposal would authorize a multisig held by Ballers to set those parameters. Balancer Labs would monitor the activiy on the pools and the market conditions and advise on the the best course of action, but Ballers would be the ultimate decision makers, acting on behalf of BAL holders. All updates would be announced in Discord beforehand.

116,"Summary
Transak was previously integrated with Aave UI(Fiat → aTokens on Aave). The purpose of this proposal is to add it to allow users in over 100+ countries across multiple blockchain networks to buy cryptocurrencies in order to get a yield-earning token in their wallets.

Details -
Background
Transak was on Aave UI. Since Aave migration has happened to IPFS, Transak proposed to be added back on Aave to enable the community to on-ramp on all the networks where Aave v3 is currently deployed.

About Transak
Transak is a single integration for applications to enable fiat-to-crypto on-ramp for a global user base. It does this by providing API-driven fiat payment methods to the on-ramp to 100+ crypto assets and abstracting away the complexity of user KYC, risk monitoring & compliance, payment methods, and customer support.

Goal
To integrate Transak Widget into Aave UI so that users can buy CryptoCurrencies against Fiat currencies using different payment methods on multiple blockchain networks.

The Problem
Unfortunately, to start earning interest on tokens or borrowing funds, users have to obtain their cryptocurrencies beforehand in order to interact with Aave. A user would have to go through as many as three steps before reaching Aave.


![image](ipfs://QmamKu8f4GVDCSmpUwWXV9qBfcFkD8P2TGFDG5sbTLAqpY)

Solution & Benefit to the Aave Community
Allow Aave users to deposit more than 100+ cryptocurrencies with credit/debit card, Apple Pay, bank transfer, or the local payment method in more than 100+ countries and get yield-earning tokens in your wallet in 1 step with only 0.5% commission for bank transfer payments extremely competitively priced.
Transak supports all the networks where Aave v3 is currently deployed and enables Aave users to access a supported DeFi in 1 step through Transak’s 1-click to protocol solution. Now users only need to enter their wallet address and pay through their preferred payment method to use AAVE. Transak’s 1-click to protocol solution hides the blockchain complexity and combines all five transactions into just one step for the user.


![image](ipfs://QmfH9a1SoPBUhYcccrvw8puVpqrP7KeJ8Kn56Z2ViX25xy)

How it Works
Using this integration, the user clicks on the buy Token button on the AAVE website to launch Transak Widget. Transak has its own smart contracts and when users deposit fiat it automatically mints yield-earning tokens and delivers them directly to their wallet. Transak takes all the complexity of what’s going on and makes it simple for the user — fiat in requested cryptocurrency out to the user’s wallet.

118,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes ZOO Crypto World ($ZOO) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with ZOO Crypto World, which combines traditional DeFi with GameFi where users can stake, earn, open NFTs, and compete. 

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $ZOO tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 780,500 ZOO
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 12PM UTC on November 26th 2021
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 12PM UTC on January 25th 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.4516 ZOO

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the ZOO Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a ZOO-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

#### What is ZOO?

From the team “ZOO Crypto World, a work by Singularity Studio, aims to solve the main issue most GameFi games experience today - lack of full immersion. The BSC space currently contains games that either contain weak IP immersion or do not amalgamate DeFi and GameFi to the extent aimed for. ZOO Crypto World has the vision of solving this issue by integrating a seamless combination of DeFi and GameFi. This allows ZOO Crypto World to appeal to most in the crypto space, whether it be through staking in pools, battling bosses with rewards, or going on PVP adventures with friends.

ZOO is the functional token of ZOO Crypto World. The token is minted through Proof of Asset mining where NFTs are the assets. ZOO is needed to experience ZOO Crypto World’s gamification, buy NFTs, and to stake for XZOO, the governance token of the platform.”

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
**Axie Infinity Shards(AXS) are an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie Universe. **

Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
By listing $AXS you will be able to leverage an entire nation of gamers.

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
**
** Version 1 First half 2021 / Staking dashboard released
AXS holders can stake their tokens through the staking dashboard and participate in governance votes brought forward by the Sky Mavis team.

These votes will revolve around which teams should receive funding from the ecosystem fund, and how the Community treasury should be distributed.

Version 2 - Early 2022

More on-chain votes about smaller issues.

Potentially changing the way votes are being counted from 1 token 1 vote to Quadratic voting.

Version 3 - September 2023 / Decentralized Organization

AXS holders determine which governance framework should be used and how much should be voted on. Some decisions will not be up for debate such as token supply which is iron-clad in smart contracts.

Potential things that can be voted on:

Should Axie Infinity Limited continue to pay Sky Mavis to develop Axie Infinity?

Should Axie Infinity use the marketplace created by Sky Mavis?

How should the Community Treasury be used to reward AXS holders and the broader Axie community?

Should the Community Treasury funds be attached to any yield farming/staking services such as Yearn.finance or Rari.Capital?

How is the asset currently used?
*. In early 2021, the Community Treasury went live. The Community Treasury began to receive revenues generated by Axie Infinity as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury is by AXS stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. A more detailed overview of the Treasury can be found here 3.

The token has been designed in collaboration with Delphi Digital.
6. Emission schedule
AXS will be unlocked in a pre-determined schedule which lasts for 65 months from the public sale. The initial circulating supply is set to 59,985,000 AXS - 22.22% of the total supply.

122,"# TLDR:

Gauntlet makes the following recommendations to optimize for risk and capital efficiency for Venus:

- Reduce BNB Collateral Factor from 80% to 75%
- Increase Borrow Caps for BCH from 4,331 to 7,000
- Increase Borrow Caps for FIL from 122,200 to 180,000


## Collateral Factor Recommendations:

- BNB: Lower CF from 80% to 75%.
 - *To clarify, Gauntlet ran an updated analysis of the protocol and this adjustment is still being recommended.*


# Methodology
This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Existing insolvencies are excluded from our simulations and VaR and LaR numbers, since we can only mitigate risk of future insolvencies. Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the Gauntlet’s Venus Risk Dashboard cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

## Risk Off Liquidations:
Whenever we lower collateral factors, there’s a chance that some users may immediately become liquidatable as a result. There are a number of accounts that lend and borrow stablecoins and keep their balances just slightly above the liquidation threshold.

Reducing the collateral factor of BNB by 5% would push 115 accounts from just above the collateral factor to just below the collateral factor. The accounts have a total borrow value of $13k. The top account has a borrow balance of $2.5k. Most of the accounts are extremely small with recursive holdings.

## Supporting Data
**Top 10 Borrowers and Borrow Usage**

The figures above show the distribution in risk among the top borrowers. A large amount of BNB is concentrated in one borrower, which could lead to insolvencies. Because of this, we can observe why a large portion of the VaR is in BNB.

## Borrow Cap Adjustment Reasoning:
Gauntlet is adjusting the borrow caps for FIL and BCH to improve user experience, as previous caps were met. Borrow caps will continue to be monitored and incrementally updated to maintain protection against manipulation.

## Risk Dashboard
The community should view the Gauntlet’s Venus Risk Dashboard to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Venus.

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile insolvency value that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile liquidation volume that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

123,"# Summary

A proposal to adjust risk parameters for WBTC.e on Avalanche deployments, to limit further exposure and promote user migration to BTC.b:

- V2
    - Freeze asset
    - Reduce Liquidation Threshold and LTV
- V3
    - Freeze asset
    - Reduce Liquidation Threshold and LTV

# Motivation

As the Avalanche network is transitioning away from WBTC.e, we are observing an ongoing decrease in WBTC.e liquidity on-chain, with approximately 30% of the liquidity diminishing over the past few months. At this time, the total circulating supply on Avalanche is 1,731 WBTC.e. A  considerable portion, nearly 67%, of the circulating supply is concentrated on Aave Avalanche V2 and V3, with ~496 and ~664 tokens, respectively. 

Given the persistence of this trend, we suggest reducing exposure on Aave and proactively modifying risk parameters for the asset. This strategy aims to:

1.  Avert a potential scenario where there is inadequate liquidity to facilitate liquidations in Aave deployments.
2. Motivate new and existing users on Aave to transition to BTC.b, which has a stronger liquidity profile on Avalanche.

### Limit New Supply

Freeze the WBTC.e reserves on V2 and V3 Avalanche.

### Reduce Capital Efficiency

Additionally, as a precautionary measure and to further reduce exposure to the asset, we recommend reducing LTs and LTV, without impacting current holders:

- V3 - reduce LT to 70 % and LTV to 0.
- V2 - reduce LT to 70% and LTV to 0.
  - at this time, this will lead to 6 accounts totaling $15 to be liquidated.

# Specification

### V3 Avalanche

| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommendations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WBTC.e | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 70% |
| WBTC.e | LTV | 70% | 0% |
| WBTC.e | Freeze Reserve | NO | YES |

### V2 Avalanche

| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommendations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WBTC.e | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 70% |
| WBTC.e | LTV | 60% | 0% |
| WBTC.e | Freeze Reserve | NO | YES |

# Next Steps

1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.
2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.

124,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-extend-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-program-4-weeks/1121).

# The Proposal
The [exchange gas reimbursement pilot](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799) will come to a close at 00:00 UTC on February 22. This proposal seeks to extend the program another four weeks, to end at 00:00 UTC on March 22. We would continue to allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy. It should be noted that three days still remain in the pilot, but at present about 20,000 BAL would still remain from that initial budget, and those tokens should be used toward the 30,000 BAL budget for this extension. The remainder will be taken from the Balancer Ecosystem Fund.

# Motivation
The initial pilot has gone well. During its first 3.5 weeks, a total of 9332 BAL have been issued to 4568 recipients. Of these recipients, only 846 had held BAL before the start of the program, which indicates that distributing governance tokens to traders does indeed improve decentralization of voting power. This decentralization has always been one of the core goals of our liquidity mining program, but that program applies only to liquidity providers and not traders.

There has been some discussion on Discord about extending the program indefinitely, but first we need an opportunity to make refinements and collect more data to gauge the program's effect on core protocol metrics. Over the course of this four-week extension, we should be prepared to make structural modifications to the program (ratified by governance) to improve the user experience, which seems to be holding back many traders from participating. We should also, as a community, make a concerted effort to increase awareness of the program in order to grow the sample size of the data.

# Mechanics
The overarching mechanics of the gas reimbursement pilot would not change. Please see the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705) for details. Also refer to the program's [expansion to all whitelisted tokens](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799), which would remain in effect throughout this extended period.

Swaps between any two of the tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json) would be eligible for reimbursement of gas costs, with limits described in the original post and summarized here:

* Only transactions between an EOA account and the Balancer Exchange Proxy would be eligible. This roughly correlates to end users navigating the [Balancer Exchange UI](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap) and would not include DEX aggregators or most arbitrage bots.
* The maximum amount of gas to be reimbursed would be 100,000 units per swap, where there can be more than one swap in a single transaction (a swap is one leg of a multi-hop trade).
* The maximum gas price (in gwei) used would be the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block.
* Reimbursements would be made in BAL, not ETH, with the median BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko for the weekly period being used to convert.
* If the number of tokens to be distributed in a single week exceeds the 7,500 BAL budget, all reimbursements would be scaled down proportionally so that exactly 7,500 BAL are issued in total. However, there is room for flexibility here: the amount issued through Week N should never exceed N*7500; but if previously unused tokens remain they can be utilized. For example, if only 1,000 BAL are spent in Week 1 but Week 2 requires 10,000 BAL, then 2,500 BAL will be taken from the Week 1 budget and put toward Week 2 so as not to unnecessarily restrict the distribution for that week.
* Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program and the gas reimbursement pilot. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.",bullish

127,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Back Tron ($TRX) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a Syrup Pool with Tron! Tron is a Layer 1 decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the TRON DAO and was launched in 2017.

#### What is Boost?

Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn TRX tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 18,888,888 TRX
 - **Distribution duration:** 120 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 23 Nov 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 23 Mar 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 5.465 TRX

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the TRX Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a TRX-BUSD farm. 

The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that. During the farm, or at the end of the 120-day period – approx. 1200 UTC on 23 Mar 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0.2x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.5x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. In case of fundamental token issues or severe risks to our users, PancakeSwap reserves the rights to downgrade to 0 multiplier until the investigation is completed.

#### What is $TRX?

From the team: “The main use cases of TRX are as follows:

* **Governance:** Obtain voting rights on TRON by locking TRX on the TRON platform
* **Purchasing new tokens:** TRX can be used to purchase tokens issued on TRON
* **Be eligible for BTT airdrop:** Addresses holding TRX will be eligible to receive BTT airdrop rewards”

The official $TRX token contract address on BNB Chain is:

**https://bscscan.com/token/0x85eac5ac2f758618dfa09bdbe0cf174e7d574d5b**

​Any other TRX token will be a scam. Always verify the token address before buying tokens. If you receive a TRX token airdrop from another address, it’s probably a scam, and we advise you to ignore it. 

A farm and syrup pool is not equivalent to endorsement of the token and you are strongly advised to do your own research before purchasing any tokens.",bullish
128,"# [Proposal] Whitelist DFX Finance Gnosis Safe for Balancer’s VotingEscrow

### Introduction

Whitelist the DFX Finance Gnosis Safe multisig, to vote-lock B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the DFX Finance community into veBAL and participate in governance for the Balancer DAO.

### Motivation

DFX Finance is a decentralized foreign exchange (FX) protocol that facilitates the seamless exchange of fiat-backed stablecoins denominated in a growing number of currencies. We are prepared to engage with the Balancer ecosystem in a meaningful way, and would like to participate in governance and incentivizing liquidity to flow through Balancer.

### Risks

DFX Finance’s multisig signers recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

### Specification

129,"We would like to address an important matter regarding the Fixed Staking Contract and propose an early withdrawal option due to significant changes in tokenomics that have greatly impacted the APY of the contract.

We understand that these changes were implemented to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project, and we appreciate the efforts made by the team in this regard. However, it has come to our attention that many community members were not aware of these changes at the time of staking. As a result, they find themselves in a situation where they are compelled to continue with their fixed staking despite the altered parameters.

We acknowledge that the decision to stake tokens was largely based on the expected APY, and the subsequent reduction in APY due to the recent changes does not seem fair to those who participated in the fixed staking. It is crucial to maintain transparency and ensure that community members have accurate information before making such important decisions.

Therefore, we would like to propose the introduction of an early withdrawal option for those who wish to exit the fixed staking contract due to the significant changes in tokenomics. This option would allow affected individuals to reconsider their staking decisions in light of the altered parameters and make adjustments accordingly.

We believe that by offering this early withdrawal option, we can uphold the principles of fairness and empower community members to make choices that align with their expectations. We also understand that the recent changes were made for the long-term sustainability of the project, and we fully support this objective. However, it is important to ensure that the staking process remains transparent and that participants are given the opportunity to adjust their positions based on updated information.

We kindly request the Pancake Community and project team to consider this proposal and engage in a constructive discussion to find a suitable resolution. We believe that by addressing this matter, we can foster a stronger sense of trust and collaboration within our community.

Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to your thoughtful consideration of this proposal.",neutral
130,"#### ABSTRACT

This AIP provides for $165,000 USD (which includes a 10% contingency) to fund a marketing initiative to increase awareness of Ape Coin.

Imagine cheering for the ApeCoin sponsored race car in a nationally televised race! I want to bring ApeCoin to the NASCAR racing community. This can be accomplished in February 2023 during the most visible week of racing — at the World Center of Racing, Daytona International Speedway. We will involve the ApeCoin community by holding a contest to custom design a fully digital ApeCoin vinyl wrap for the 200 mph race car! That’s right, the ApeCoin community will design the look of the race car! The winner (and companion) will receive airfare, accommodations, Pit Road Patio Suite credentials to the race (The Lucas Oil 200) and infield/garage credentials to meet the team and the ApeCoin race car prior to the race. ALL members that vote for this initiative will be eligible to join us at Daytona and watch the race from the Pit Road Patio Suite (thats right behind the race teams on pit road)! We will have a random drawing for up to 35 members to join us and support the ApeCoin race car! The goal of this funding is to increase awareness and adoption of ApeCoin.

#### OVERALL COST

Total cost will be $165,000 USD (which includes a 10% contingency). This includes: all transportation, testing and racing costs, digital vinyl wrap, fan base marketing outreach at the track, marketing personnel, giveaways, Pit Road Patio Suite for the ApeCoin community, ApeCoin display race car and operation costs.

135,"# Summary
We are thrilled to present this budget proposal on behalf of Aave Companies and our ongoing commitment to support the Aave Community. This proposal will enable the Aave DAO and Aave Companies to collaborate and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem and drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption at key events like DevConnect, rAAVE, and ETHGlobal Istanbul.

# History
Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, and stakeholders.

Aave Companies recognizes the fundamental importance of the Aave Grants DAO in nurturing the DeFi ecosystem and has consistently provided support to the AGD through direct collaboration. Historically, Aave Companies has worked alongside AGD to bring sponsorship and presence at hackathons and events, designed and created the highly coveted Aave merch, and brought rAAVE to life in various cities across the globe.

# Overview
Aave Companies is requesting a budget allocation of $550,000 paid in GHO for the remainder of 2023 to support a range of activations and events to continue growing and nurturing the global Aave Community. These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:
1. Sponsoring Hackathons: Aave Companies intends to sponsor hackathons to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as the new stablecoin, GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2 but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem.
2. Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences allows the Aave community to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge and industry insights. These events often include panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts. Side events are also where Aave is able to show our commitment to inclusivity and diversity in the web3 ecosystem by tapping into new communities and audiences. We’re proud to be supporters of groups such as SheFi and BoysClub.
3. Merch: Aave Companies recognizes the importance of high-quality merchandise in building brand recognition. We intend to continue to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement efforts as well as to proliferate the ghost. We will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials, and creating merch people actually wear, use, and love.
4. Development of the GHO Pass: With one of the core missions of the Aave community being to grow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity, we’re excited to announce Aave Companies’ development of the GHO Pass. The GHO Pass V1 will facilitate GHO purchases at both Aave events and events we sponsor. We plan to launch GHO Pass at DevConnect, where users can get early access to a select group of rAAVE tickets and drink credits, exclusive merch, and other perks.
5. rAAVE: To celebrate and give back to the Aave community, we plan to host another edition of our vibrant and highly demanded event, rAAVE. Such events serve as an excellent opportunity for building “hype” around the Aave brand and creating a memorable experience for the Aave community. We will also explore live streaming rAAVE, and integrating GHO pass (as mentioned above). We will continue to manage ticketing logistics, press relations, as well as rAAVE social media.

# Activations
Activations continue to be a key focus and driver of growth for the Aave ecosystem thanks to:
- Creating a welcoming, engaging and memorable experience at the Aave booth.
- Sponsoring side events, hackathons, prizes and providing exceptional support to developers.
- Spreading Aave’s culture by distributing highly coveted merchandise.
- Selectively hosting rAAVEs to bring the Aave community together, reward contributors and make Aave the top ecosystem in crypto.
- Developing GHO Pass payment portal.

| Name  |  Date  | Details |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ETH Global Istanbul  | Nov 17-19  | During the week of Devconnect. ETHGlobal puts on arguably the most reputable hackathon events in the Ethereum ecosystem. Istanbul is a community with substantial and growing crypto adoption and is a prime market to engage hackers and the community with Aave and GHO.  |
| rAAVE  | Nov TBD  | rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem. We will host one rAAVE during the course of this proposal that is powered by GHO to help spread adoption and awareness.  |
| Devconnect + Side Events  | Nov 13-19  | This will be the event of the year in the Ethereum community. Hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, this event will be one of the most attended web3 events of 2023. Activating here will allow us to reach a wide audience and connect with many from our community.  |
| Side Events	  | Q4  | Side events we’re currently considering include: SheFi Summit Istanbul, Certora at DevConnect, Scroll Day, notDevcon by ITU Blockchain, StableSummit Istanbul. Funds from any side events that are not confirmed will be rolled over to the next potential side event.  |

For this proposal, Aave Companies is focusing on sponsoring fewer events, while increasing the quality of Aave’s presence.

A majority of the new event spend will be used to have an impactful presence during Devconnect, ETHGlobal Istanbul, and rAAVE in order to drive hackers to build with GHO and to increase GHO utilization within the wider community. Since Devconnect week will be the marquee event of the year, any remaining budget after our main sponsorships will be allocated to side events related to DeFi or Smart Contract Security.

# Next Steps
- If Snapshot is successful then move to AIP

# Conclusion
Aave Companies is deeply committed to the Aave community. We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of $550,000 paid in GHO for activations and events will not only enrich the ecosystem but also foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition. We look forward to the DAO’s support in enabling these initiatives to come to life and continue to drive the growth of the Aave ecosystem. We will rollover excess budget to Q1 2024 events.",bullish

#### PancakeSwap and Token Supply

The state of DeFi and PancakeSwap has changed immensely since our inception in September 2020, and we propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750,000,000 (750M) to better reflect our long-term outlook on PancakeSwap and the $CAKE token.

#### Current PancakeSwap Tokenomics

In the kitchen, we have been working hard to bring value to PancakeSwap and the $CAKE token, from providing new products (e.g. Perpetuals), to sourcing the tastiest Syrup Pools and Farms. Unique amongst AMMs, we also burn transaction fees from platform activities (e.g. trading, prediction, farm auctions) to further increase the scarcity of the $CAKE token.

**But we can do better, and we will.**

#### Proposed Cap on CAKE Maximum Token Supply

We propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M $CAKE. Based on our calculations – which can be found in detail in our [**litepaper v2**](https://v2litepaper.pancakeswap.finance/) – this comfortably gives us an approximate runway of 3 years, before the current circulating supply reaches this cap. 

We believe that implementing this proposed cap will enable the $CAKE token to better reflect the value, community, and sustainability of PancakeSwap.

#### What’s next?

If the community decides to approve the proposal to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M, we will formally incorporate it into our tokenomics, and institute the max token supply cap.

137,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-renew-funding-for-the-ballers/2284).

## Introduction
For those who don’t know, the Ballers are a group of long term community contributors to Balancer Protocol. This proposal will feature messages from the Ballers about their activities to give the community some context around analyzing the value of this proposal. Under the current framework the Baller program is being funded in three month increments. Our current round of funding is set to expire November 1st, 2021. Over the last few months, the program has grown significantly in member count and scope. Commensurate with this growth is an increase in the funding cost. Currently the Ballers operate with no hierarchy - it is up to each Baller to determine their level of “Ballery” (full or half or none) and their level of engagement.

I have taken the role of distributing the Ballery so I check in with each Baller every month to see what they’re up to and if they have any feedback/concerns. We’ve also adopted bi-weekly Baller Round Table meetings to better coordinate amongst ourselves. I asked each Baller to write up a bit about what they’ve been doing recently so the community has some context to frame the discussion around this proposal - note this was up to each Baller to determine if they wanted to write anything or not.

You can see the list of currently active Ballers [here](https://www.notion.so/63091677228841de9fa909139e60362f?v=a7852fc9da684a5a834934e5215edd6d). This is updated to be reflective of the next three months.

Notable changes compared to the previous three months: Tongnk is going from half Ballery to none as he’s primarily focused on grants where he’s directly compensated. Andrea, Mike B, and Xeonus are moving from half to full as the scale of their contributions have increased.

## Baller Active Roles & Contributions

Please see the forum post referenced at the top of this proposal. This section was too large to fit in the snapshot vote.

## Conclusion & Specification
With a proposed roster of thirteen active Ballers (five full, eight half) at the current rate of 500 BAL per month for full and 250 BAL per month for half with 60% fully unlocked after two years (1 year cliff, 1 year linear vesting) and 40% liquid immediately, the total cost of funding for the next three months is as follows.

1,800 BAL per month in liquid payments * 3 = 5,400 BAL
2,700 BAL per month in vested payments * 3 = 8,100 BAL

In addition, I request 300 BAL as a spending fund to reward notable community contributions and fund any small projects the Ballers might need funding for.

#### Total: 13,800 BAL

If approved, the ecosystem fund will distribute this amount to a wallet I control. The Ballers desire to re-use existing vesting contracts, so the vested amounts for each Baller would be fully released in October 2023. I will work with Mike McDonald to make a contract for any Baller who does not have an existing vesting contract with a fully vested date that matches the existing ones.",bullish

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings

Author: @Dydymoon

Date: 2023-08-29

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Proposal resubmitted as the last vote didn't reached the quorum.*

# Summary
Explain AIP-42 proposal & gauge the community thoughts to update the strategic assets from veBAL to an alternative solution increasing the emission power considering current metrics.

# Background
In March 2022, Llama proposed a strategic partnership with Balancer (Part I & Part II). The DAO used the BAL to buy B-80BAL-20WETH LP tokens, that would be locked for veBAL. This position was meant to be used for its emission power, enabling rewards redirection on AAVE & GHO gauges.

This estimated veBAL position & market metrics at the time were taken into account for the SM upgrade proposals (which includes migrating the current LPs to Balancer V2, implement new categories & slashing parameters, define the smBPT gauges, updates incentives management, create a strategic asset management framework, and further considerations.)

Considering that veBAL was likely to be needed before the SM upgrade implementation, Llama introduced the StrategicAssetsManager contract, creating a base framework to manage assets from Goverance or with a committee. The TEMP check vote ended mid July, and the contract was submitted to BGD for review after.

From Llama’s side, the code supporting veBAL position is already implemented via the StrategicAssetManager contract and can be deployed pending community feedback. However, an external proposal from Aura drastically impacted the veBAL strategy early August.

# Motivation
On July 28th, a proposal (AIP-42) was submitted 4 on the Aura governance forum, with the goal of improving $AURA distribution efficiency especially on L2s and alignment of parties receiving Aura rewards.

While there are benefits for Aura and vlAURA holders, this proposal also directly impacts veBAL holders in several ways, which is why the Aave DAO should be aware of it.

The proposal (approved on August 6th) considerably impacts the $AURA emissions by reducing the base distribution by 60%, which is compensated by $AURA distributed from the treasury, but only to vlAURA voters according to their voting weight on gauges.

As a reminder, there are min & max APR on Balancer, depending on veBAL holdings/boost acquired, while Aura is using its share of the veBAL supply to boost LPs & add AURA rewards in return of a fee on BAL rewards, making it more efficient for most LPs to deposit.

For this reason, the value of incentives generated per 1$ of bribes can take into account BAL + AURA emissions, which was equivalent before AIP-42 (i.e you’d get the same emission power by farming on Aura & voting with veBAL or with vlAURA)

*Post AIP-42 this changes, because:*

* veBAL emission power is limited to BAL + base Aura rewards (reduced by 60%)
* vlAURA emission power is increased with BAL + base AURA + additional AURA rewards from Treasury

Aura will keep boosting LPs with its veBAL share, and should keep a higher APR than Balancer for depositors.

Considering that emissions changes took effect on August 24th on Aura, it’s still early to draw conclusions and it might take time for the market to react & adapt. While some changes can already be observed, it might take at least 1-2 extra rounds (2-4 weeks) for the market to normalize.

## Potential impacts of AIP-42 related to Aave utilization:

### veBAL emission power reduced:

As only vlAURA can redirect extra rewards from the treasury, 1 veBAL will have less emission power than the equivalent vote in vlAURA.

### veBAL holders migration to vlAURA:

Assuming that veBAL holders are considering to switch to vlAURA, it could have several sub impacts:

* veBAL holders choosing to let their position decay to exit (increased BAL emission per veBAL: temporary if ppl then migrate to auraBAL or another wrapper effectively relocking veBAL, but not if assets are sold for AURA and locked.)

* If veBAL holders sell their BPT for AURA on market, the AURA price would increase because of the limited liquidity. It could also impact BAL price and B-80BAL-20WETH liquidity.

* If the veBAL accumulation by Aura protocol is not following this potential migration, it would lead to a dilution of the veBAL underlying vote per vlAURA (a small decrease was already visible over the past days, to 0,1587 veBAL/vlAURA currently)

### veBAL/vlAURA bribe cost update by the market:

Some changes are already visible on bribe marketplaces, but we should expect more updates to happen in the coming weeks: Since veBAL has less emission power, the bribe cost should also decrease. On the other side, since the overall AURA emission is lower, so the bribe cost also seem to decrease, but the value / veBAL vote should increase, creating a decorrelation in the pricing depending on which asset is bribed. Another aspect to take in consideration post AIP-42 is the proportion of vlAURA votes / total votes bribed.

Before Aura proposal, the emissions were equivalent, but now, whether the split is 20% veBAL 80% vlAURA or the opposite considerably changes the results, so it’s most likely to see vlAURA bribed first.

### Pros of switching to vlAURA:

* Max emission power on DAO owned strategic assets
* 4 months lock (compared to veBAL lock time is 1 year)
* No decay on vlAURA, meaning no need to relock weekly
* Voting are calculated in round (2 weeks) so less votes to cast

### Cons of switching to vlAURA:

* Liquidity is small so it can be an issue if Aave DAO wants to acquire AURA on market but OTC deals can be considered
* Risk of efficiency reduction if the Aura protocol BAL accumulation doesn’t follow the vlAURA supply increase.
* No veBoost on vlAURA (but Aura deposits are boosted with their veBAL share)

vlAURA allows for more agile management. Considering that Aave DAO voted to lock veBAL but didn’t lock it yet, it makes sense to consider an update of the strategic assets allocation.

# Other Considerations:

* Long-standing strategic relationship between Aave and Balancer
* Cost of selling B-80BAL-20WETH BPT
* Cost of acquiring vlAURA via OTC deals
* Understanding any potential security and ecosystem risks involved
* Dev resources to add vlAURA support to current StrategicAssetManager
* Review time by BGD of the vlAURA implementation

# Specifications:
This TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to consider an update of the Balancer ecosystem holdings (B-80BAL-20WETH) for an alternative solution. This would mean dedicating part (or all) of the current B-80BAL-20WETH holdings to acquiring vlAURA in order to retain the max emission capacity of the voting power held by the DAO.

If this proposal is approved, ARFCs will be published:

* To add vlAURA support to the StrategicAssetManager contract (Llama)
* To share options considered for AURA tokens acquisition (TokenLogic)

# Disclaimer:
Currently contributing to TokenLogic & Llama as a strategist, I participated in the Llama proposals mentioned above and am currently working on SM strategy, as well as on the GHO liquidity strategy with TokenLogic.

The analysis can be useful for both purposes above but is published on my own initiative, so this proposal is not requesting compensation from any third party. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared to facilitate understanding & community discussion.

# Next Steps:
TEMP CHECK: Gather community feedback and sentiment towards the proposal of updating Balancer ecosystem holdings for a more efficient solution with the following voting options:

- YAE (Update the strategy)
- NAY (Use veBAL as intially voted)
- ABSTAIN

ARFCs: If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, analysis and finalization of the proposal.

AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.",neutral

Title: [ARFC] Cancel Llama Service Provider Stream 
Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative
Date: 2023-07-30
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes to cancel the Llama stream from the Aave DAO

## Motivation

Llama has historically been a service provider for the Aave DAO and has made numerous contributions. However, during their tenure, there have been several instances where Llama's performance has fallen short of expectations. 

For instance:

* Llama's handling of the crucial CRV AIP was a clear demonstration of their inability to deliver a much-needed payload in a timely manner. The delay in execution resulted in an additional cost of approximately $1 million for the DAO due to the increased valuation of CRV. This incident underscores the need for service providers who can reliably deliver on their commitments and highlights Llama's underqualification for the task at hand.
* Despite receiving $1.5 million from the DAO, Llama charged third parties for consulting services related to Aave, including teams seeking asset listings.
* As treasury managers, Llama failed to ensure that the collector contract had an adequate aUSDC balance. This oversight resulted in several service providers going unpaid for weeks, tarnishing the DAO's brand and reputation..

Given these circumstances, we believe that the most beneficial course of action for the Aave DAO is to end our relationship with Llama. This will allow the DAO to reassess its needs and budget for a new service provider.

The ACI and other service providers will complete any outstanding tasks from Llama's engagement at no additional cost to the DAO.

By terminating Llama's stream early, the DAO treasury can save up to approximately $240k. These funds can then be reallocated to other initiatives, ensuring the most efficient use of the DAO's resources.

145,"##### ABSTRACT
The purpose of this proposal is to give voting rights back to the broader ApeCoinDAO community and its delegations for Working Group Steward positions.

The Ape Assembly was established as a Governance Working Group Initiative outlined in AIP-239, aiming to facilitate Working Group Steward elections. However, with as few as twenty active voters in recent weeks, there are growing concerns about the legitimacy that those elections would carry. Furthermore, we need Stewards who have experience in conducting significant outreach within the ApeCoin DAO community, which only DAO-wide campaigns can provide.

Currently, there will be four new Stewards elected in the upcoming Metaverse and Marketing and Communications Working Group elections scheduled to commence Nov 1, 2023, with approval to execute critical functions for the DAO moving forward.

To address these issues and enhance overall voting participation, this proposal recommends shifting future Working Group Steward elections from the Ape Assembly to a tried and true DAO-wide voting structure.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
This AIP benefits the ApeCoin ecosystem by ensuring that Working Groups meet their mandates of providing critical functions and services to the DAO, and continuing to provide a voice for the broader ApeCoin DAO community through their ability to vote, while maintaining consistency with all other elections.

This AIP adheres to the DAO’s values of Collective Responsibility and Boldness by taking decisive action to address this issue of representation in Working Group Steward elections, and working towards progress over perfection.

##### OVERALL COST 
No Cost

Following the [**multichain vote**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/bafkreigzab36tzr4d46jf72isgxqtejcoirnmrifxsxio7ggxwb2rmtnte), Chefs have been launching, monitoring, and optimizing the liquidity levels, trading experience, and overall UI/UX on Aptos.

Thanks to the support of the community – and many of you have noticed this –, we are the premier DEX on not just BNB Chain, but also Aptos, with **~50% of the Aptos TVL**.

By **voting yes** on this proposal, you signal your support for PancakeSwap to continue our multichain deployment on Aptos, and further our goal of becoming a multichain one-stop shop for all things DeFi.

#### Details of current Aptos Farms

There are currently 14 farms deployed on Aptos:

1. APT-ceUSDC
2. APT-lzUSDC
3. APT-whUSDC
4. CAKE-APT
5. CAKE-ceUSDC
6. CAKE-lzUSDC
7. ceBNB-ceUSDC
8. ceUSDC-ceUSDT
9. ceUSDC-ceWETH
10. lzUSDC-lzUSDT
11. lzUSDC-lzWETH
12. stAPT-lzUSDC
13. whUSDC-whBUSD
14. whUSDC-whWETH

The current APRs are consistent with, or higher, than other DEXs on Aptos which incentivize the same pairs. Chefs believe that the current emissions are suitable in the initial phase of deployment, and will look to revise emissions again as we develop our products further and achieve more adoption on Aptos.

#### Future plans for Aptos 

This confirmation concludes the first step of PancakeSwap’s deployment to Aptos. From here on, we intend to build upon the initial deployment considering the following: 

✨ PancakeSwap will aim to get further visibility within the Aptos ecosystem to attract additional Aptos-based projects to deploy on PancakeSwap;

🥞 PancakeSwap will look to bring more our existing and build on future products to Aptos so that we can attract more projects with a more competitive offering;

🤝 PancakeSwap will be looking to leverage its strength on BNB Chain to attract Aptos-based projects to BNB Chain and vice-versa, so as to improve CAKE burn.",neutral

### TLDR:
- In April, the UADP submitted an application to participate in the Arbitrum LTIPP (long term incentive program pilot)
- We were able to receive 1,000,000 of ARB, the largest amount out of all other DEX applicants
- In our application, we stated that “the UADP will request the Uni DAO to decide whether or not it wants to partially match this 1.0M ARB ask. The options the DAO has to vote on are four: $250k, $500k, $750k, and $1M. We cannot guarantee that the DAO will vote to match incentives, but we will make a best-effort attempt and report the results of the temperature check”
- We will be collaborating with Gauntlet and Merkl to distribute the incentives (cost breakdowns are below)
- To those ends, we are running this temperature check to see if the DAO is interested in matching the given LTIPP grant to some capacity

### About the LTIPP Application

Uniswap did not apply to the first two rounds of Arbitrum incentives (STIP 1 & 2). This was for two reasons:
- Native DEXs and smaller protocols deserve a chance to make a name for themselves and perhaps offer unique protocols for trading
- We did not have a formal structure like the UADP to help facilitate an application

Since many native DEXs–and non-native ones–have already had the chance to apply for ARB incentives throughout the past year across multiple incentive distribution initiatives, the UADP decided that it’s now the right time for Uniswap to also partake in these programs, especially since other blue-chip protocols also applied for these incentives. Plus, the establishment of this committee has allowed Uniswap DAO to further mature its relationship with Arbitrum DAO. We’ve partaken in multiple discourses, participating in all of the votes taking place on Arbitrum since November 2023.

The LTIPP pilot program is a 3-month long incentive program, with 45M worth of ARB to be distributed among an elected group of protocols. A total of 174 applications were vetted by the LTIPP Advisors, with whom we interacted and obtained feedback during the month of March. One of the primary sticking points was the amount of capital that we initially requested, along with clarifications around some of the target KPIs behind our request.

After some deliberation, in line with many other projects, we ended up lowering our ARB ask from 2.5M to 1M, which increased our chances of being admitted into the program by the Advisors and ARB delegates. Uniswap was able to attain the largest amount of incentives from the cohort of DEX applicants:.

### Uniswap LTIPP Grant Structure and Execution

Below is a breakdown of how the LTIPP funds will be used:
- 900k ARB for incentives: 882k ARB: The bulk of these funds will be used to incentivize liquidity providers on Uniswap using Gauntlet’s dynamic optimization engine. 18k ARB: For Merkl to distribute the funds. Merkl charges based on a percentage of the incentives distributed.
- 85k ARB for Gauntlet: they will dedicate part of its Applied Research team, the same team currently managing the Uniswap/Arbitrum liquidity mining program, to this initiative.
- 15k ARB for UADP: These funds will be sent to the UADP multisig with the goal of making this meta-governance initiative a self-sustaining program. This will allow Uniswap DAO to maintain its voting participation in the Arbitrum DAO.

In order for us to accept this grant, we had to elect three signers onto a Gnosis Safe, and each member had to follow Arbitrum Foundation’s KYC process.

All performance reporting will be conducted by Gauntlet, just as they have been providing analytics regarding their previous Arb-Uniswap incentive program.

### Incentive Matching

It’s clear that Uniswap has a steeped history with Arbitrum. We are currently the dominant DEX by TVL and volume on the L2. After ETH L1, Arbitrum is where Uniswap has the largest stronghold. It is therefore important for delegates to potentially consider doubling down on this ecosystem.

Uniswap DAO and Arbitrum DAO have also conducted themselves symbiotically ever since Uniswap launched on the L2 in August, 2021. Below are some contributions that Uniswap has made to the Arbitrum ecosystem in the past year alone:
- Gauntlet has shipped out a Dynamic Incentive Optimization for Uniswap V3
- Uniswap/Arbitrum liquidity mining mid-point retrospective
- Set up a Uniswap-Arbitrum Working Group
- Funded a ~$2m Uniswap-Arbitrum Grants Program
- Created an active metagovernance group (Uniswap-Arbitrum Delegate Program)

Now that Uniswap has attained 1M ARB from Arbitrum, we are fulfilling our end of the bargain to see if Uniswap would like to reciprocate to some level:

As mentioned, it is up to Uniswap delegates to decide whether or not matching is favorable. Doing so would signify to the Arbitrum community our continued support, and in the UADP’s opinion, allow for further collaboration and grants in the future. If any funds are approved, they will follow a similar distribution structure and execution as above and be grouped together in Gauntlet’s incentives allocation.

Voltz is a new DeFi primitive, bringing interest rate swaps to DeFi in a manner that is up to 3000x more capital efficient than alternative models. Voltz, therefore, is not a competitor to Uniswap but instead is complementary; interest rate swaps are a core pillar of well-functioning financial systems - so as Voltz grows it should help DeFi grow, which in turn should have second order benefits to Uniswap.",bullish

**Protocol Description:**

> Bifrost ([https://bifrost.finance](https://bifrost.finance/)) is a substrate based Kusama and Polkadot parachain that provides non custodial decentralised cross-chain liquid tokens for staked assets. By leveraging on Polkadots cross-consensus message format (XCM) it provides standardised cross-chain liquid staking services for multiple chains (currently 6+ chains).
> 
> Bifrost is currently one of the largest liquid staking protocols on Polkadot with a current total TVL of $63M. vETH, Bifrost liquid staking token (LST) for staked ETH was launched in late November of 2020, and is the protocols largest LST in terms of TVL with $36M. vETH is an ERC-20 decentralised yield bearing dual protocol asset that supports both ERC 20 and Substrate Based (via the Ethereum <-> Polkadot transfer bridge) in the future.
>
> In order to adapt Ethereum Shanghai update, vETH 2.0 is a new contract which involves two main new functions:
>
> 1. Once The Merge is completed, the exchange rate of vETH/ETH will gradually increase as staking rewards accumulate.
> 2. vETH 2.0 supports vETH unstake.
> At the initial stage of vETH 2.0 launch, two steps of multi-signature still remain (sign by 5 members in Bifrost governance [council](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/council/members) + [technical committee](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/techcomm/members)):
>
>1. Deposit confirmation: SLP deposit contract executes the final step to deposit ETH to Beacon Chain validators. Before that, it needs Bifrost multisig contract to confirm that the withdrawal credential hash in deposit json (validator deployed by [Infstones](https://infstones.com/)) is the same as Bifrost generated.

> Bifrost plans to replace multisig steps by using Secret Shared Validators (SSV), which encrypts a validator key and splits it into several KeyShares. These KeyShares are distributed to four non-trusting nodes run by operators, delivering a robust, fault-tolerant, active-active redundancy for Ethereum staking. Thus, the current multisig process will be abandoned.

**Motivation:**

> With the imminent Shapella update, Bifrost has upgraded its vETH contract and is looking to implement itself within Ethereum and the broader L2 ecosystem. Bifrost aims to expand the availability of its LST and its liquidity through Balancer given its flexibility and unique value proposition within the liquid staking market. Furthermore, by ensuring that the vETH/ETH pool on Balancer is its primary liquidity hub, Bifrost objective is to strategically integrate with protocols such as Aura Finance to provide composable and competitive yield solutions and use cases for holders. Given Bifrost's desire to integrate with both Balancer and Aura, Bifrost is committed to driving value to the veBAL and vlAURA markets via Hidden Hand voting incentives.

title: [Proposal] Whitelist Index Coop's Investment Account Gnosis Safe for Balancer's VotingEscrow
status: Proposed
author: @Matthew_Graham (Index Coop)
created: 10-05-2022

---

# Summary

The proposal aims to add Index Coop DAO’s Investment Account address to the Balancer VotingEscrow whitelist. This will enable the Index Coop Community to vote-lock BAL (B-80BAL-20WETH) and participate in Balancer DAO’s governance, [1].

# Abstract

Index Coop has been in discussions with Balancer DAO about building indices products on Balancer v2 and just recently, created its first liquidity pool on Balancer v2 on the Polygon network, [2,3,4,5]. This delta neutral pool of leverage trading products is the first basket of Index Coop products and symbolisies Index Coop’s strong desire to work with the Balancer community. Index Coop would like to continue investing in the Balancer community relationship by being able to vote-lock BAL (B-80/20 BAL/ETH) and to again, be an active participant within the Balancer DAO governance process.

At the time of writing, Index Coop has approximately $4.4M of capital deposited into the Balancer Boosted Pool on mainnet and to date has earned around 2,500 BAL, [6,7,8]. Index Coop intends to deposit BAL with ETH into the B-80BAL-20WETH pool.

# Motivation

Index Coop intends to build financial products on Balancer v2. To date we have explored creating managed pools that resembled a basket of tokens much like DPI and more recently began exploring how to integrate several products into a single liquidity pool. We had hoped the LAYER1 product would be the first collaboration project and there was strong support within the Index Coop community to build this product on Balancer v2, [9]. It now appears, LAYER1 may not be the initial collaboration product and other opportunities are being explored.

In preparation, Index Coop deployed a portion of the DAOs stablecoins to earn BAL rewards with the intention of locking those BAL rewards and using the veBAL position to support growing future products developed on Balancer v2. With the introduction of ve tokenomics, there is a need for Index Coop to lock the BAL, attain the boosted rewards APY and maximise the veBAL holding potential in order to best support future product launches.

Index Coop has recently created a delta neutral Flexible Leverage Indice pool on Balancer v2 on the Polygon network, [2,3,4,5]. These pools are the first pool where Index Coop is creating a basket of products in one pool. Longer term, the vision is to integrate various strategies like icETH into Balancer Boosted Pools via Index Coop’s exchange issuance. This is expected to offer users varying combinations of yield and risk profile investment options whilst also providing liquidity to the underlying assets.

Prior to the introduction of ve Tokenomics, Index Coop was a keen participant in Balancer DAO’s governance process. Index Coop participated as a DAO on 27 BAL votes, [10]. Although Index Coop’s holding is small, it can still be used to actively participate in Balancer’s governance process.

# Specification

Whitelist `0x462A63D4405A6462b157341A78Fd1baBfD3F8065` to interact with the veBAL contract, [7].

160,"**Introduction**

Whitelist the OlympusDAO Gnosis Safe multisig, to vote-lock B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the OlympusDAO community into veBAL and participate in governance for the Balancer DAO.

**Motivation**

Olympus DAO is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the OHM token. Each OHM token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. DAI, FRAX, wETH) in the Olympus treasury, giving it an intrinsic value. Olympus also introduces novel economic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding. Olympus sees Balancer as a viable partner with an ecosystem that offers a lot of potential integration opportunities, this is evident in the proposal for the [OHM-DAI-wETH veBAL gauge](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/ohm-eth-dai-50-25-25-gauge/3023/9). The DAO is looking for a closer partnership to participate in governance and incentivizing more liquidity to flow through Balancer.

**Risks**

OlympusDAO multisig signers recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

**Specification**

162,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z  The Happy Ape, an official MBA #00349, is a premium brand that aims to foster a culture of kindness, compassion and positive mental health in our future generations. This AIP would directly fund the creation of The Happy Ape children’s book and plush, nfc tags, and dapp development on ApeChain creating a unique digi-physical web3 experience for both kids and adults. I believe in the future of ApeCoin and am proudly offering a 20% gross revenue back to the dao based on the initial products sold. With the development of AIP-378 I will use ApeChain and $Ape to create innovative solutions, and integrate them into the products. Bored Labs, LLC. will take on the majority of work that is required, reducing costs needed from the dao and includes but is not limited to, e-commerce site creation [thehappyape.io](thehappyape.io), add $Ape as an accepted payment for our products, develop the majority of ApeChain dapp work, and nfc configuration. All development will be open source and will be fully audited, ideally by boring security dao or in cooperation with Horizen Labs. (edited)

What makes any of this special? Our children’s book will be one of the very first web3 books that can not only teach children and parents about the power of the blockchain, but also onboard them as well using ApeChain. The book is fully written and authored by myself. Here is a quick summary of the book below, or skip it for the juicy tech.

![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/4/4fa2a982de08cd201b68bfb210630005b085a7f8_2_500x500.jpeg)

“The Happy Ape and his friend journey on a daily adventure, gathering bananas amidst the vibrant jungle. Their routine centers around a central tree housing a precious book where their banana counts are meticulously tallied and stored. When theft of the only book shatters their dreams, The Happy Ape crafts a magical book, uniting the jungle’s apes in trust. With every ape receiving a copy of the newfound magical book, no one could lie, steal or cheat because all books have to agree. All of the ape’s lives changed for the better, The Happy Ape and his friend finally could purchase the coveted bouncy ball, playing happily ever after together.”

Such an amazing story isn’t it, how can it get any better? I plan on integrating an nfc tag into every book. Thus delivering a digi-physical experience allowing the user to scan the tag with a compatible mobile device and instantly mint a digital version of their book. This will be a seamless cost free user interaction all powered by our ApeChain (kudos Horizen Labs). In order to do all of this I plan on partnering with IYK, a premier supplier of nfc tags in the web3 space. Their mobile app will allow easy access to our digi-physical experience. This requires the development of smart contracts and a dapp on ApeChain. The development will be achieved through Bored Labs, LLC., and will be open source. I believe that open source development leads to better community adoption, security, and transparency. I have many plans for the evolution of our digi-physical experience as well. IYK allows for OTA updates, easy updates to modules introducing the user to new features like unique stories, animations and more. In addition to this experience I will also have an e-commerce site with the ability to purchase the products with $Ape.

To ensure an unforgettable and joyful experience, I have designed with meticulous attention to detail, a special Happy Ape plush, ensuring they become cherished friends for all. This plush will be approximately 15’’ in length and 6’’ wide. Many plushies are small and not even comfy. Our design ensures a warm, soft, and comfy embrace. The Happy Ape is sure to be a loving companion for so many around the world.

Digitizing Items
* Permanently link a 1:1 NFT to a physical Item (shown above irl test)
* Independently deploy Chips without any knowledge of code
* Schedule campaigns according to specific groups of Items
* Configure your digital experience using IYK Modules

So…“Who are you entrusting valuable DAO funds to, you may wonder, and what qualifies me for it?”

Let me start off by introducing myself. My name is Kevin, I’m 37 and I’m married with 3 kids. 8 yo girl, 6 yo boy, 2 yo girl. I’m a software architect and I’ve been in the web3 space for a few years. I have run a successful software company, Bored Labs, LLC., for 3 years now. I have bookshelves full of children’s books and bags full of plushies. The amount of time I’ve spent reading to my kids and playing with plushies is measured in years! I believe in the power of community and helping others which is why I am here. My passion to share kindness and love back into the world while helping others is what motivates me to do this. I want to provide value back to the various communities connected to apecoin and help them grow as well. I hope that through future collaborations I can work with other communities like bulls on the block and mocaverse to continue creating positive and inspirational children’s books along with animated videos. I believe this is a small stepping stone that will lead to a much larger goal of combining web3 ip use to bring people together.

I added a budget for marketing that will help ensure reach and the success of my brand. Half of the marketing budget will be given back to the buyers of my products. A simple marketing strategy i’ll rely on will be asking product buyers to post images of themselves with my products and reward them with $APE. The other half will be reserved for various marketing efforts as needed.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
 Most importantly ApeCoin DAO will be supporting and empowering our future generations through a unique onboarding digi-physical experience that will help amplify innovative solutions on ApeChain. This AIP will help promote the use and growth of ApeChain and $APE by building one of the first dapps that will help onboard many new users and introduce them to ApeCoin. The Happy Ape products aim to give more visibility to the ApeCoin community in a positive light. We will also be reaching a new audience that we haven’t explored much of. Our products support kindness, compassion, and positive mental health which is something we could all use more of.

We’re offering 20% gross revenue back to the DAO to show gratitude and continued support back to the community. (Detailed under our Overall Cost)

As a result of this proposal, IYK has promised that they would add ApeChain as a supported chain to their application.

This would allow anyone using IYK to use ApeChain as their selected chain to mint nfts on. It would help guide the development and use of digi-physical experiences on ApeChain, and directly fund code that is open source leading to better security and adoption starting within our community. We need a better way for fast adoption of ApeCoin.

I will ensure resources like artists/animators are from the ApeCoin community. With many more future books and animated videos I plan to collaborate with more ApeCoin communities. I promise to innovate new ways of incorporating ApeChain and $Ape into our future products as this is just a stepping stone for us. It’s important that we continue development around ApeChain and $APE. I would be honored to have ApeCoin DAO help us cultivate positivity into many lives of our next generation around the world.

166,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

168,"#### Upgrade of UniWhale’s Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift UniWhale’s Farm rewards from the current UNW-BNB v2 LP to the new UNW-BNB v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the UNW-BNB v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the UNW token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current UNW price.)

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new Farm will have doubled emissions for the first 7 days. For example, if the v2 farm is emitting 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will emit 20 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 10 CAKE per day thereafter. 

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake UNW-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.2x multiplier
- **8 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.25% fee tier):
- Stake UNW-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.4x multiplier (0.8x multiplier for the first 7 days)
- 16 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and **8 CAKE per day** thereafter 

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 0.4x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### What is UniWhale?

UniWhale is an oracle-based decentralized perpetual exchange, where users can trade BTC, ETH, and other top cryptocurrencies with leverage.

#### What is $UNW?
From the team: “UNW is the utility token of the UniWhale ecosystem that can be traded and transferred. UNW allows users to stake and participate in the distribution of its trading fee revenues and token emissions.

Users can convert UNW into esUNW (Governance token). With esUNW, users can participate in the project's governance.”

The official UNW token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:

**https://bscscan.com/token/0x5b65cd9feb54f1df3d0c60576003344079f8dc06**

​Any other UNW token will be a scam. Always verify the token address before buying tokens. If you receive a UNW token airdrop from another address, it’s probably a scam, and we advise you to ignore it.",neutral

170,"## Summary

A proposal to make parameter changes on the Aave Polygon V3 market. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-recommendation-to-lower-stmatic-maticx-non-emode-lt-pt-2/15314).


## Motivation

Following up on our [previous recommendations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-recommendation-to-lower-stmatic-maticx-non-emode-lt/14859) on lowering stMATIC / MaticX non-emode LT, these recommendations are geared towards the following:

- Risks associated with increased stablecoin borrowing against LST collateral, amidst lower MATIC LST liquidity
- Lower risks of reduced WMATIC supply in the future, which may cause long-term growth risk for Polygon v3
- Encourage WMATIC borrowing against MATIC LST collateral


## Specification

**stMATIC / MaticX non-emode LT / LTV on Polygon v3**
- Option 1
    - Decrease stMATIC LT from 60% to 50%
    - Decrease MaticX LT from 62% to 50%
- Option 2
    - Decrease stMATIC LT from 60% to 56%
    - Decrease MaticX LT from 62% to 58%

171,"#### Proposal to Launch veCAKE Gauges System

![](https://i.imgur.com/8kO0mY8.jpg)

#### Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

Over the next few days, the Kitchen is proposing to introduce **veCAKE**. This update is designed to empower CAKE holders with increased governance influence, boost liquidity across our pools, and supercharge rewards for CAKE stakers.

As announced in our [**Q4 Roadmap**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/readme/roadmap), PancakeSwap will be shortly launching vote-escrowed CAKE (veCAKE) and voting gauges. Voting gauges allow for veCAKE holders to vote on where future CAKE farm emissions will be directed.

Launching voting gauges will allow existing CAKE holders, stakers and protocols to begin accumulating veCAKE.

**At a high level, veCAKE holders will be able to:**

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders will be able to directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE managers and bribe markets, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE rewards and receive voting incentives for doing so. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to automate their voting and potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
Voting gauges are planned to be launched in phases, beginning with all liquidity pools on BNB Chain, Ethereum and Arbitrum.  Voting gauges on other chains will be added in progressive steps as we roll out all features related to the gauges.

The initial phase of veCAKE will include gauges for all farms that are currently receiving CAKE emissions across these three deployments. This means that every liquidity pool that currently has emissions is eligible to receive veCAKE votes.

#### The Kitchen’s Participation in veCAKE

Initially, the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum will be **~0.99 CAKE/block**.  This allocation will be taken from the existing CAKE Syrup Pool (~0.35 CAKE/block) and the Farm Emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum (~0.64 CAKE/block).

As part of the voting gauges design, the Kitchen proposes to retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to these farms. 

There are two key reasons:
- To ensure a smooth transition for liquidity providers from farms managed by the Kitchen to farms which are managed by veCAKE voting, without affecting their APRs significantly in the initial rollout
- To ensure that core liquidity pools continue to receive sufficient incentives, so that liquidity depth and fee generation are not significantly affected. This will ensure the continuity of CAKE burns from trading fees, which drives deflationary CAKE tokenomics.

*Note: “core liquidity pools” include major LPs like BNB, ETH, BTC, stablecoins, and CAKE.*

In the initial rollout phase, the Kitchen will distribute these votes based on the following principles:
- Ensuring core liquidity pools are provided a competitive return on their LP positions
- Ensuring that existing Syrup Pool partner arrangements are met before migrating them fully to the veCAKE gauge voting system
- Ensuring that any of the smaller farms which did not receive any votes after the launch of veCAKE will receive at least some allocation in the initial rollout, capped at their current emission levels.

With the proposed vote allocation, the Kitchen will distribute its share of votes at the end of each voting epoch after all voting participants have voted. 

In other words, the Kitchen will apply its voting share (at maximum, translating to ~0.4 CAKE/block) as far as needed to smoothen out any possible abrupt changes in the Farms, while allowing veCAKE participants to get used to the gauge voting mechanism. 

If the gauge voting results will not affect any core liquidity pools and trading volumes significantly, the Kitchen will abstain from voting in that particular voting epoch or vote in alignment with existing votes.

Over time, the Kitchen aims to reduce the portion of CAKE emissions directly managed by the Kitchen as all veCAKE participants become familiar with the process.

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE launched shortly after this vote concludes. Additionally, the Kitchen will provide CAKE holders a comprehensive FAQ on participating in veCAKE and the voting gauges.",bearish
172,"#### ABSTRACT

The goal of this proposal is to establish the ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group.

The ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group’s mandate is to:
“Build income generating projects for the ApeCoin DAO, ApeCoin Initiatives like ThankApe, Boring Security DAO, MBA licensed projects and the ApeCoin community. ApeChain will be a strong focus point once we reach that point.”

Working Groups enable a sustainable community-led infrastructure that further decentralizes the DAO, creates operational efficiency, and is flexible enough to adapt to any opportunities that may arise.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

It was recently announced that the ApeCoin DAO can receive revenue from AIPs and projects within the Ape and ApeCoin communities. There has been much talk around bringing much needed value back to the DAO and believe there needs to be a more structured focus on doing this. The ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group will focus solely on this and aims to create various projects and initiatives that will serve this exact purpose.

Working together as a community I feel we can implement various simple solutions that will drive value and needed resources back into the DAO and other initiatives alleviating the sell pressure on our much loved $APE token. In addition we expect to see the ApeChain come to life sooner, rather than later and there needs to be a strong focus on building on this to ensure it’s long term success.

If you build it, they will come…

#### OVERALL COST

173,"Summary:

DeFi lending protocols often use rewards in the form of token emissions to boost supply and borrow APYs, in hopes of attracting new users. Nonetheless, high emissions rates increase the protocol’s token circulating supply, affecting the price negatively, especially in a bear market.

When market conditions are not favorable cutting emissions may have a positive effect on the protocol token price and could also create an opportunity for growth if used as an investment.

Lastly, the previously proposed and ratified prime token program is intended to serve as the strategic solution for boosted supply APY and borrow rate subsidies, ensuring that any valued integrators and protocol participants will continue to reap competitive rates.

For this reason, we are proposing the following:

-Reduce XVS emissions on supply and borrow markets by 50% of their current rate.
-Remove XVS emissions of supply and borrow for SXP

title: ARC: Extend the Safety Module Protection to Aave V2 Arc
status: WIP
author: Governance House, @MatthewGraham @ncitron, 3SE Holding & uhom 
created: 25/07/2022

---

# Simple Summary

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module (SM) protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested.

# Abstract

The Safety Module is a $700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users. It’s a unique mechanism within DeFi, that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users. At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market. As a result, not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection.

As new markets hold more risk at launch, they are initially excluded from the SM protection. Today, most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO, they seem fit for SM protection.

# Motivation

The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi. This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market. As new markets hold additional risk, these are not initially protected by the SM. However, once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months, the risks are significantly lower. Furthermore, the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process, with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2.

Overall, these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market, holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market. This implies that, in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market, the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market. Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks, as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers.

Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers (lps) on these markets. By reducing the risk for lps, it is expected to lead to further growth of the market’s TVL overtime. Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets, lps are treated more equally across the markets.

The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets. In the case of Aave markets on other chains, the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure, and not failures caused by the chains themselves (Polygon/Avax). With regards to the Aave Arc Market, Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAO’s stated risk parameters, should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update, the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance.

These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem. In particular, the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive. Today, most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon, while just about 100k on Ethereum V2. These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections, in a shorter time period.

175,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across four (4) Aave V2 assets. 



## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV and ENJ.** The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. 



## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.


| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **CRV Liquidation Threshold**    | 65%     | ***64%***     |
| DAI Liquidation Threshold     | 80%     | 85%     |
| DAI Liquidation Bonus    | 5.0%     | 4.0%     |

| LINK Liquidation Threshold     | 78%     | 83%     |
| LINK Liquidation Bonus    | 6.3%     | 7.0%     |


See below volatility and exchange volume data from 07/01 to 08/03. These are valuable metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations.

| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| CRV   | 	  1.47619713      |  1.778618025  | 		-0.302420895   |  77.315888   |

## Notable Accounts to Flag

As of 8/3/2022, the data shows that no accounts would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on the forum post.




## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

179,"Summary

A proposal was published on the Community Forum to add support for both stETH and wstETH but due to stETH being a rebasing token, that could increase the complexity and it would require a deep analysis to check implications on liquidations, rewards, etc and further delay deployment. 

For this reason, we are proposing to add support for Lido’s wstETH market only at this time on ETH mainnet.

Rationale

wstETH is a well-established and widely recognized token in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH. It’s more composable with DeFi protocols.

Motivations

By integrating wstETH into its markets, Venus Protocol would allow its users to earn lending APY on their staked ETH holdings, loop yield vs ETH and borrow other assets like stables for their daily operations. Furthermore, supporting these tokens would also enhance Venus Protocol’s overall liquidity and trading volume.

Conclusion

Adding support for wstETH tokens on Venus Protocol would provide users with access to a wider range of investment opportunities, enable them to earn lending APYs on top of staking rewards on Ethereum, and enhance the liquidity and trading volume on the platform.",neutral
180,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Zebec Protocol ($ZBC) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Zebec Protocol! 

Zebec Protocol is a continuous settlement protocol on the BNB Chain. The protocol enables continuous, real-time money streams, and uses ZBC as its governance token.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn ZBC tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 18,182,000 ZBC
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 19 Dec 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 17 Feb 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 10.52 ZBC

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the ZBC Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a ZBC-CAKE farm.  


The farm will have 0.2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.1x rewards after that. At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1200 UTC on 17 Feb 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.1x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $ZBC?

From the team: “ZBC is the governance token of the Zebec Protocol. It serves two main use cases within the Zebec Ecosystem. 

* ZBC staking allows holders to access Zebec's Product Suite for free and earn cashback when using the Zebec Card. 
* ZBC will be used to pay for transactions in the Zebec Blockchain and as the reward token for Zepoch Node holders and network participants

# Reactivation

Hi! On behalf of the GnosisDAO, I'd like to reactivate the discussion so we can rerun the vote to **increase the GNO cap from Cap3 to Cap4 ($10M -> $30M)**

As @rabmarut stated:

- There is currently ~$19M worth of GNO in Balancer pools, making it the most liquid DEX for GNO

- Raising the cap would further incentivise liquidity, which is beneficial for both GnosisDAO (people can acquire the token in larger amounts) and Balancer (more trading volume) 

- This would further strengthen our synergies for a collaboration around GPv2 Meta-DEX Aggregator and Balancer

- GnosisDAO has committed to not selling BAL in the market and will instead hold the tokens in order to be an active governance participant

Looking forward to get the voting started once more!

# Original

**TL;DR**

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). GNO adjusted liquidity has been consistently greater than $10m since December 2020.

**The Proposal**

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M).

At the time of writing GNO has over $22M in total liquidity on Balancer Pools, and has thus surpassed its $10M cap.

Gnosis hopes to further strengthen synergies with Balancer in light of the upcoming launch of Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator. V2 channels orders to underlying on-chain AMMs for execution and hopes to be integrating Balancer as one of its first partners.

As Gnosis has contributed liquidity for multiple Balancer pools, Gnosis currently holds 52,146 BAL. Gnosis holds and continues to earn a significant amount of BAL tokens which it intends to transfer to GnosisDAO to hold as an investment, instead of selling in the open market.

[Balancer is currently the most liquid exchange for GNO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gnosis) and it would be good to keep incentivizing it to avoid the fragmentation of its liquidity. The GNO token migration to other exchanges could potentially reduce Balancer’s competitive advantage of having the lowest fee and slippage for GNO/ETH pairs.

**What is GNO?**

GNO is the governance token of [GnosisDAO](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosisdao-a7102fcf9224), which launched Nov 23rd 2020 and has since seen significant growth in community engagement. It currently has a $164M market cap.

GnosisDAO owns several core Ethereum infrastructure components such as the Gnosis Safe which currently holds [more than 2% of the total ETH supply](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/ul0PgNtcq9MwezZThlHrgOMEIzpvEmkdwA9XoVqi). GnosisDAO will soon launch Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator that channels liquidity to on-chain AMMs such as Balancer.",bullish

Title: [ARFC] TokenLogic & karpatkey Service Provider Partnership
Discussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633
Author: @TokenLogic @karpatkey
Created: 2023-12-05

---

# Summary

This ARFC is to onboard TokenLogic & karpatkey to provide financial services to the Aave DAO for an initial period of 180 days, with a combined budget of 400k GHO.

# Motivation

## Overview

TokenLogic & karpatkey are responsible for delivering the following services to the Aave DAO: 

* Treasury Management;
* Strategic Assets' Liquidity; and
* Safety Module.

This funding will be used to support the TokenLogic and karpatkey teams to deliver the scope as outlined in the [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633).

## What to Expect

This proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO’s treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.

### Treasury Management

#### Develop the Architecture for Managing Aave's Assets

We aim to define a robust architecture for asset management. This architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s “shortExecutor”. Over time this will lead to fund management delegation and reduced governance overhead.

As the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.

#### Financial Security

A key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO’s known budget and anticipated expenses. 

This approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO. Key components of this objective will include:

* Bridging Aave funds between networks;
* Migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and
* Swap assets to align expenses and holdings.

Do note, that financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost-conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.

### Strategic Assets' Liquidity

TokenLogic and karpatkey will lead the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) and oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:

* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO’s price movement towards re-pegging while maintaining its utility across a full range of AMMs.
    * Utilize Maverick’s design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.
    * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.
    * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.
    * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility in their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave’s AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.
* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token’s value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:
    * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.
    * Enhance GHO’s extrinsic demand by incentivizing stable swap pools, such as Balancer’s GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.
     * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer’s architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO’s price stability.
     * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.
    * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.
* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it into tangible rewards through participation in voting markets such as Curve, Convex, Balancer, and Aura.

For operational simplicity and alignment with the DAO’s strategic objectives, evolving the GHO Liquidity Committee into the Aave Liquidity Committee is a logical step. 

### Safety Module

As part of the scope, karpatkey and TokenLogic will focus on modelling the SM performance during shortfall events and present proposals to diversify asset categories. This proposal will feature how the DAO can utilize the vlAURA position, realize synergies between GHO Liquidity and overall attempt to reduce the DAOs insurance fund spend.

The below outlines at a high level what we intend to deliver:

* Introduce additional asset categories to promote diversification and reduce the dependence on AAVE as a backstop for the protocol. 
    * Initial parameter configuration will incorporate feedback from @ChaosLabs & @Gauntlet. 
    * We will explore the feasibility of including GHO LP assets and harness rewards from other protocols.
    * Technical lift associated with creating new categories will be performed by @bgdlabs, with a security audit, if required.
* A 90-day emission forecast will be provided ahead of each emission cycle for community feedback. TokenLogic and karpatkey will prepare the payload to extend the SM emissions for @bgdlabs for review. 
    * Iterative emission cycles enable the DAO to target specific asset categories and improve the correlations between bad debt potential whilst maintaining a base level of insurance. The proposal will feature the ability to reward some categories with non AAVE rewards, like GHO, to support adoption and velocity.
* Capital efficiency, optimize emission schedules to balance attracting and retaining new deposits for each respective category. For example, the APR on stkAAVE is expected to continue being reduced given the recent GHO Mint Discount utility being added and the introduction of new categories.
* Analytics, a dashboard will be created/maintained that tracks the effective coverage of the insurance fund under various market conditions. The deposit value, composition of assets, APR over time and impact on the DAOs runway will all be readily available for the community to view. This is expected to create transparency and provide insight into the performance of the SM as an effective insurance fund for the DAO.

# Specification

The AIP will call the createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController interface to create two 180-day streams for 220k and 180k of GHO.

The following address will be the recipient of the 220k GHO stream:
Address: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`

The following address will be the recipient of the 180k GHO stream:
Address: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`

TokenLogic and karpatkey will periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.

TokenLogic and karpatkey are to be included in the Gas Rebate program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts, deployment and testing costs.

Upon the ARFC Snapshot passing, the GLC SAFE Signers will be updated. The following signer `0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f` is to be replaced with `0x818c277dbe886b934e60aa047250a73529e26a99`.

When the AIP onboarding TokenLogic and karpatkey as service providers pass, TokenLogic and karpatkey will jointly lead the GLC for the duration of the service provider contract with the Aave DAO.

187,"# November CAKE Emission Reduction

It’s time for our monthly vote on CAKE emissions!

## Read before voting

Before you vote, make sure you understand the long and short term effects that changes to CAKE emission can have.

- Read and digest the CAKE Tokenomics documentation first: 
[https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics)
- Read this proposal in full;
- Make up your mind, and cast your vote!
    

#### Why reduce emission?

The end goal of reducing emissions is to make CAKE “emission neutral” or “deflationary”. That means, on average, the amount of CAKE burnt per block will be more than the amount of CAKE minted.

#### What are the downsides?

Reducing CAKE that is distributed to farms has negative effects, and the proposal options we are providing take this into consideration.

If we were to burn 0.5 additional CAKE per block, as was the option in October’s vote, **our CAKE-BNB APR may drop by roughly 15%.** This is likely to have a negative impact on liquidity for our platform, and also affect the many projects we support here on PancakeSwap.

This is why, to keep our farms at a healthy APR, and to encourage liquidity on our platform, the options we are proposing this time round are much smaller: **no change, 0.1 CAKE per block reduction, and 0.25 CAKE per block reduction.**

To give you a better idea of the effect of reduced CAKE emissions on farm APR, consider the following examples to see how larger reductions might affect the APR:

| Total Emission Reduction Per Block    | No change     | -0.1    | -0.25    | -0.5    | -1    | -2    |
|:---:    |:---:    |:---:    |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| CAKE Allocated to Farm & Lottery     | 4.5    | 4.4     | 4.25     | 4    | 3.5    | 2.5    |
| CAKE Emissions / block     | 14.5     | 14.4     | 14.25    |14    |13.5    |12.5    |
| Est. CAKE-BNB APR (40x Multiplier)     | 36%    | 35%    | 33%    | 30%    | 24%    | 13%    |

Many projects’ farms with lower multipliers will also have their APRs significantly reduced.

#### But we need to become deflationary! Inflation is too high already!!!

We agree. It’s absolutely still the goal to keep CAKE “emission neutral” or “deflationary”. 
That said, given the current state of the market, it might be time to ease up on the aggressive emission reduction… for now. There’s a fine line between supply reduction, and damaging the farm APR.

We hear lot of voices pointing to CAKE inflation as a reason for recent price action, which is an understandable hypothesis. However, when you take a look at CAKE’s price trends in comparison to other AMM-related tokens, the similar charts suggest that there’s a more macro element at play here than just CAKE inflation.

So. To make sure we keep supply low, we’re working on more ideas that will instead contribute to bigger and bigger weekly CAKE burns. Stay tuned!

#### What's the current supply?

So far, effective CAKE emission per block has already dropped from 40 CAKE / block to only 14.5 CAKE / block.

We also burn CAKE from an increasingly wide number of sources every week. Check out the list here:

189,"*Summary*

Despite being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols, Uniswap’s outstanding voting power does not necessarily translate into active governance participation. In fact, many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50% vote participation rate, and some even as low as 10% or 0%. While there have been previous [campaigns ](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1653077861706739714?s=20) to encourage delegation by large UNI holders, we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated, if at all.

In healthy governance environments, proactive delegates wield significant voting power, ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met.

Therefore, this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate 2.5 million UNI to each of 4 active yet underrepresented delegates selected based on the criteria outlined below. To ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum (as explained further in Participation Requirements) or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will 1 year term so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without fulling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.

*Landscape of Uniswap Governance*

*Source: Butter*

Despite numerous improvements to Uniswap’s governance, there are still several areas that require further improvement. One prominent area is governance participation, which has witnessed a downward trend compared to late 2022 and early 2023.

Another issue is many large delegates are now inactive, and the delegators who entrusted them with delegation are either unaware about this inactivity or simply do not care. For example, there is currently several delegates with more than 2.5 million UNI delegated who never even voted onchain according to Tally, see the screenshot below.

*Source: Tally*

Therefore, further distributing governance power to active but underrepresented delegates is a positive step forward ensuring governance is more active, resilient, and robust.

**Participation Requirements**

* Must have voted on 80% (or more) of proposals (minus the proposals that were canceled) over the last 3 months (as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot). This includes both Snapshot and Onchain proposals (such as Tally or Agora)
* Must have actively participated in proposal voting for more than 3 months and have a Delegate Platform on Uniswap Forum under Delegation Pitch

**Application Criteria**

* Meets the above Participation Requirements
* Voting Power is less than 2.5 million UNI (as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot).

**Next Steps**

* Should this proposal pass on Snapshot, a 5-day period will begin where delegates that meet the above criterias are encouraged to post their application to be considered for delegation. In cases where there are more than Four qualified applicants, there will be an additional Snapshot vote to determine the top Four. Once Four or fewer applicants are selected (in case there are not enough delegates that meet the criteria), it will proceed to an onchain vote.

**Other Clarification**

-The term will be 1 year from when 2.5 M UNI is delegated.

-Should the onchain vote be approved but there are three or fewer qualified applicants because there are not enough qualified applicants, there WON'T be a subsequent application period and Snapshot vote after the initial vote to fill the remaining available recipients.

-Should the onchain vote be approved and there are qualified applicants but one or more of them are disqualified in the future due to their low vote participation, there will NOT be a new application and snapshot vote to give the opportunity to another delegate.

-As mentioned by in a previous [proposal ](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-onboarding-ekubo-inc-as-a-core-developer-of-uniswap-protocol/22085/20) seeking UNI delegation, there will be deployment of at max four new [Franchiser ](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/blob/main/spec.md) contracts, each one funded with 2.5M UNI (10M UNI total). The owner of these Franchiser instance’s would be the Timelock, while the at max four delegates chosen through the voting process outlined above can act as the delegatees.",bullish

**Summary:**
This proposal suggests activating a Balancer gauge for the PRF/WETH (80/20) pool on Arbitrum.

**Protocol Description:**

Parifi is a novel perpetual protocol that introduces an innovative pricing mechanism for perpetual contracts. It leverages liquidity curves and on-chain oracles to dynamically adjust prices based on current market conditions. By using advanced mathematical models like parabolic and sigmoid functions, it offers more predictable and stable pricing and fees, considering factors such as liquidity and active trading positions.  

**Motivation:**

Parifi Finance aims to boost liquidity within its Balancer pool. Recent observations indicate that insufficient liquidity has led to price volatility for Parifi. Implementing a gauge and incentives through Hidden Hand could encourage greater liquidity within the Parifi Balancer pool. Parifi DAO initially provided liquidity for the pool and retains a share of the current liquidity. By introducing a gauge and incentives, Parifi DAO could also accumulate BAL tokens through gauge emissions. 

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:**                                                                                                                        Parifi currently operates with a multi-signature wallet [GnosisSafe | Address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x009ed9DF75B3426F8F082c02548fE9a03F6cCE75). The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to contributors and transition to decentralized governance in the future.     

2. **Oracles:**                                                                                                                             Parifi leverages the Pyth Network's oracle data in several ways:

- Adaptive Pricing: By using Pyth's real-time data, Parifi’s liquidity curves offer accurate and fair prices, adjusted according to market liquidity and volatility.
- Order Execution: Each trade is confirmed against the latest market data, ensuring that traders get the most current prices at execution time.
- EMA Integration:** Parifi uses Pyth’s exponentially weighted moving average (EMA) as a secondary check for price verification, ensuring trades are executed within predefined price deviation limits.

3. **Audits:**                                                                                                                                 The detailed audit reports for Parifi's current version are available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Parifi/audits)

4. **Centralization vectors:**                                                                                                       Parifi operates as a decentralized protocol, ensuring decision-making processes are distributed across its network, fostering transparency, resilience, and trust. This aligns with decentralization principles, creating a fair and open environment for all participants.

- Treasury is 2 of 3 multisig

193,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes unshETH ($USH) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with unshETH! 

unshETH is a DeFi protocol that allows users to deposit their Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) to mint unshETH, an “index” of ETH LSDs.

The goal is to improve validator decentralization among the different Liquid Staking Protocols via incentives. When the deposit ratio of the different LSDs is closer to the “optimal ratio” set by governance, unshETH holders will collectively earn higher yields as a result.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn USH tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 320,000 USH
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1400 UTC on 25 Apr 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1400 UTC on 24 Jun 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.1851 USH

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the USH Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing an **unshETH-USDT (0.25% fee tier)** and an **unshETH-USH (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm on BNB Chain.


The **unshETH-USDT (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm will have 35x CAKE rewards for the first week, followed by 23x CAKE rewards for the remaining 53 days. The **unshETH-USH (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm will have 12x CAKE rewards for the first week, followed by 8x CAKE rewards for the remaining 53 days. During and at the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1400 UTC on 24 Jun 2023 – the farms will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $unshETH?

unshETH is a diversified liquid staked ETH index that earns staking ETH yield and swap fees (not live yet), all wrapped in a single omnichain ERC-20 token available on ETH and BNB Chain.

Within the unshETH ecosystem, users can:

- Mint unshETH by depositing a supported ETH liquid staking derivative (e.g. wstETH, cbETH, rETH, sfrxETH)
- Redeem a mix of the underlying LSDs proportional to the current deposit ratio for each unshETH
- Earn ETH staking yield by simply holding unshETH

The team is also working on the following utilities, which are in development and are not live yet:

- Swap between LSDs up to their maximum weight as determined by the “optimal ratio” set by governance
- Earn swap fees by simply holding unshETH

For more information on how to interact with unshETH, visit **[here](https://docs.unsheth.xyz/)**

#### How do I get $unshETH on BNB Chain?

There are two ways to get unshETH on BNB Chain
- Deposit BNB or USDT on BNB Chain **[here](https://unsheth.xyz/deposit)** and receive unshETH. The protocol handles all the back-end work for users, read more **[here](https://mirror.xyz/0x749Dc728A68265e74754Ad8e6cc2649BD42a8f8a/t7vYrWdiqPycEhm956mqEDbPa8F6tNxeKCcxFP11_AQ)**
- Mint unshETH on Ethereum **[here](https://unsheth.xyz/deposit)** and bridge it over to BNB Chain **[here](https://unsheth.xyz/bridge)**

#### What is $USH?

USH is the governance and incentive token to accelerate the growth of unshETH’s TVL and liquidity, and to foster competition among liquid staking protocols through a convex-style ve-locked USH system. 

Staked USH (vdUSH) governs:
- Index composition of unshETH, such as the types of supported LSDs and their respective weights within the index
- Allocation of USH incentives and partner protocol incentives
- Fee curve parameters and fee switch

title: Add DPI on Aave V2
status: WIP
author: Matthew Graham (@MatthewGraham)
shortDescription: Add DPI on Aave V2
discussions:  https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3576
created: 2021-07-19
---

## Simple Summary

Add DPI as collateral support for DPI to the Aave market. 

## Abstract

Add DPI to Aave V2 market.

The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) is a capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of decentralized financial assets across the market.

DPI is an ERC20 token that enables users to gain exposure to a basket of DeFi protocols via single transaction. The reduced volatility and broad diversification is a great property for collateral.

The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. DPI aims to track the projects in DeFi that have significant usage and show a commitment to ongoing maintenance and development. At the time of writing there are 14 tokens included in DPI. 

## Motivation

Aave would be the first major lending protocol to integrate an index product into its platform. DPI is becoming a DeFi standard and adding DPI would dramatically increase support for these efforts. 

There are over 12,000 DPI holders and growing. Adding DPI as collateral would bring users into the Aave ecosystem allowing capital, yield and value to accrue to Aave participants.

## Specification

DPI is a market capitalization weighted index product that follows a predetermined qualitative and quantitative methodology. The composition of the DPI portfolio is maintained by DeFi Pulse. 

The DPI token has no governance characteristics and is predominantly traded via the V2 Uniswap DPI-ETH pool. DPI is supported and maintained by Index Coop and is built on TokenSets infrastructure. 

At the time of writing, DPI has a market capitalization of greater than $220M and is the most readily traded DeFi index product.

There is an annual 95 basis point fee for holders of DPI that is split 70/30 between Index Coop and DeFi Pulse respectively. 

DPI-ETH earns INDEX rewards through liquidity mining, currently yielding upwards of 20% APR, in addition to around 5% in trading fee income with limited impermanent loss.

## Rationale

By purchasing DPI, users are able to gain exposure to leading DeFi protocols in the form of a single ERC20 token. The risk of holding just a select few protocols within a portfolio is diversified away, giving holders broad theme based exposure to DeFi.  

With Aave currently making up 20.88% of DPI, there is no better way for Aave to support DPI’s widespread adoption, than to enable DPI being utilized for borrowing and lending. With DPI trading since October 2020 and 90 day average trading volume of around $7.2M.

Additional information see Index Coop’s website: https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi

## Test Cases

Being a standard ERC20, the Aave protocol test cases already cover everything needed to support DPI. 

## Implementation

The implementations must be completed before any AIP is given status ""Implemented"", but it need not be completed before the AIP is ""Approved"". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of ""rough consensus and running code"" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

## DPI - Aave Risk Assessment 

Details can be found on the Aave governance forum post linked below.
https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3576/9

# Overal Risk Score: B-

The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) is an index product managed by Index Coop. At the time of writing there are 324,355 DPI in circulation. DPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions.

# DPI Smart Contract Risk: C-

DPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions.

# DPI Counterparty Risk: C

DPI is a product whereby holders of DPI have no metagovernance influence on Index Coop or the protocol within the index. DPI trades on the ethereum network and inherits the trust of the network much like USDC. DPI has over 12,055 holders and the DPI-ETH pool is Uniswap’s 17th largest at $90M. Anyone can Mint, Trade and Redeem DPI.

The DPI utilises TokenSets V2 smart contract has been audited by Open Zeppelin audit [September 4th, 2020] which identified privilege roles in many of the contracts. The key findings are highlighted below:

* The Controller contract has an owner that chooses the contracts that comprise the system. This includes all of the modules, resources and the factories that can be used to make Sets. 

* The IntegrationRegistry tracks third party integrations that can be used in the system. It also has an owner that can add, remove and edit the integrations as desired. 

* The PriceOracle has a list of oracles and adapters that can be used to retrieve third party prices. It also has an owner role that can choose the supported oracles, adapters and price pairs.

# DPI Market Risk: B-

DPI’s price tracks the Net Asset Value of the underlying assets, by holding a basket of protocol tokens the volatility of a single asset is dampened. This is reflected by DPI having a standard deviation of 5.75% since exception compared to ETH and AAVE which has a standard deviation of 5.03% and 7.79% respectively over the same time period (03/10/2021 to 01/05/2021). When considering liquidity, the average daily trading volume is $7.19M, based on over a trailing 90 day trading period. However, DPI holders have the option to mint/redeem the underlying tokens within DPI which draws on the liquidity of the underlying assets and also allows for any deviation from NAV to be arbitraged away by traders.

195,"This proposal originally appeared on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-increase-defi-l-captier-from-cap1-to-cap2-1m-3m/808).

As outlined in the [updated whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the DEFI+L capTier from `cap1` to `cap2` ($1M → $3M).

# The Proposal

The total adjusted liquidity of DEFI+L has surpassed $3M, well over the imposed cap of $1M. The cap should be raised in order to distribute a more equal share of BAL tokens to DEFI+L pools via liquidity mining.

# What is DEFI+L?

DEFI+L is the most popular and liquid pie from PieDAO, a creator of tokenized ETFs which was among the earliest builders of Balancer smart pools. Blue chips only. DEFI+L represents DeFi’s biggest and best. Like all our pies DEFI+L actively rebalances, constantly locking in profits as market prices fluctuate.",bearish
196,"**TLDR**: This proposal adds Manta Pacific to the v3 deployments record and grants Manta an Onboarding Package, which includes $250k of UNI incentives for three months on four key markets and Angle Merkl’s integration of Manta. Separate from this proposal, Manta has arranged for Oku to support Manta, and the contracts have been deployed.

The following are the proposed pools for the program, but they can be amended for the onchain vote.
 * ETH/STONE 0.05% - 30%
 * ETH/USDC 0.05% - 40%
 * USDC/USDT 0.01% - 10%
 * MANTA/USDC 0.30% - 20%

The Manta team has committed to providing incentives alongside the Uniswap DAO and plans to solidify their exact plans once this Temperature is successful and prior to the onchain vote.

Key points:
* Manta has already contracted with Oku to support the new deployment.
* The contracts have been deployed and verified.
* The deployment is ready for immediate launch.

198,"#### Adjustment of Outer Ring MMO’s Liquidity Pair 

We were approached by Outer Ring MMO to shift Farm rewards from the current GQ-BUSD LP to the new GQ-USDT LP

We believe that transitioning to the GQ-USDT pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the GQ token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. 

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new Farm will have the same parameters as the existing Farm, with the same amount of CAKE incentives going towards the pair – the differences being the change of the liquidity pair and moving from v2 farm to v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake GQ-**BUSD** LP, earn CAKE
- 1x multiplier

New v3 Farm (0.25% fee tier):
- Stake GQ-**USDT** LP, earn CAKE
- 1x multiplier (no change)

The farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 1x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### What is GQ?

From the team: “Galactic Quadrant (GQ) is the governance token of Outer Ring MMO. It allows holders to influence the game through its governance platform directly. It is the main element of the player-driven economy, and can be obtained by completing quests, competing, or trading in-game assets with other players.”

200,"The prior snapshot on this topic was deemed to be invalid due to problems with the voting strategies causing users to be unable to vote. Badger believes all voices should be heard and the Council elected to re-run this vote.

Also, option 4 is new. It was requested by the victims of the hack. 

## TL;DR
There is ~$300k left in an ibBTC multi-sig from the yields generated by assets used to mint ibBTC. These funds are user funds but the users themselves cannot be identified. This BIP proposes options for how to allocate these funds for the benefit of the DAO and its users.

## Option 1: Seed Initial eBTC Liquidity

Sell the assets and place them into a tightly bound wBTC / eBTC Uniswap v3 pool with 0.01% fees. This would be provide for great initial and perpetual liquidity, allowing for Badger to have an initial pool to swap in and out of for many users that we don’t need to incentivize with further Badger tokens. This plan assists in the vision of eBTC as a permissionless and perpetual option by providing initial liquidity without any drain on Badger emissions. Once eBTC is deployed, this option would see the LP launched by the treasury in support of eBTC.

## Option 2: Extraordinary Bootstrapping Yield for eBTC
This option would see the funds sold and then used on the launch of eBTC to provide for extraordinary yield for the launch of eBTC liquidity pools. This would provide for a bootstrapping phase for eBTC of approximately 10% APR on $3M of initial liquidity. Note that this plan would see those funds distributed in conjunction with any other sources of yield and incentives as provided for in the treasury controlled launch of the eBTC token.

## Option 3: Community Council Controlled Yield Assets

This option seeks to place the funds at the discretion of the community council with the purpose of investing and stacking more yield assets. The Community council would decide on what assets to keep and what to sell and then seek to use those yield assets across de-fi to build out a larger control of governance tokens and positions. This idea does not seek to emit the principal at all, but instead to invest the funds and then keep a portion of the earned yield to reinvest and emit a portion of the earned yield to vault depositors.

In this model, the council will attempt to adhere to the following;

1. Invest in a variety of yield bearing assets and stack them perpetually until the launch of eBTC. This may include the market purchase of Badger tokens for depositing in LPs at a rate not to exceed 50% of the total yield being generated.
2. The yield and governance stacking phase will last for 6 months to allow for an optimum investment of yield bearing assets after which time emissions will begin.
3. Once the emissions phase begins, the council will seek to emit 50% of the monthly yield to vault depositors and retain the other 50% for the stacking of more governance and yield bearing tokens.

In this option, the community council will decide on the investment of all funds but will need to draft a new BIP to decide on where emissions go once the initial 6 month period has elapsed.

## Option 4: Allocate Funds to Restitution
Badger BIP 80(a), 80(b) and 80(c) outlined the terms of restitution. BIP 80(a) voted to allocate 2mm BADGER over a 24 month period.

If this option is selected, the assets in question will be sold into BADGER and allocated to the restitution program in addition to the 2mm BADGER allocated in BIP 80(a).

Timing of the sale will be coordinated by the Badger Treasury Council to minimize slippage of the sold assets, optimize purchase price of the BADGER tokens while concluding the allocation of BADGER tokens to restitution before the restitution program is scheduled to mature.

202,"# LONG TERM SYRUP POOL CAKE STAKING # 
It’s time for our vote to have locked CAKE staking! The end goal of locked staking is to become CAKE holder with earning profit for long period, that means more CAKE staking and burning.


**Why you should participate in long term staking?**

It enables CAKE holders to earn substantially higher APY's than short unlocked staking, traditional savings accounts or money market funds. With long term staking we can burn more cake and may effect reducing the amount of CAKE in circulation may have on the token’s price. 





**⚠️Please note⚠️**

CAKE hodlers should understand the potential effect of long term staking. Earlier redemption will be availbe with fees, which will burn.

***You can vote for any one of these three options!***

203,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-balancer-labs-to-emergency-pause/2399).

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable a multisig controlled by Balancer Labs team members to control the Boosted Pools emergency pause mechanism during its first 3 months.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) have an emergency pause period which is **hardcoded at 3 months** from the time the factories were deployed. During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. **Funds can always be withdrawn by users** , even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.

Since gathering 6/11 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also **authorizing a Balancer Labs controlled multisig to pause the system** . The [BLabs Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B) will be controlled by a handful of team members at Balancer Labs. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Governance Multisig nor the BLabs Multisig will have any pause power.

An important distinction between the pause mechanism in Boosted Pools and that of previous pool types and of the vault is that Boosted Pools are not supposed to be unpaused. In practice, after a pool is paused users should withdraw assets from the pool and a new pool should be deployed. In the event that the pause mechanism must be triggered, Balancer Labs will commit resources to draw attention from liquidity providers to the fact that they must withdraw their funds.

## Specification

The Balancer governance multisig on Ethereum Mainnet ( `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` ) would submit a transaction to the Authorizer ( `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` ) in order to grant the following roles to a Multisig controlled by Balancer Labs ( `0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B` ):

1. the ability to call the `setPaused` function on pools deployed from the `AaveLinearPool` factory ( `0xD7FAD3bd59D6477cbe1BE7f646F7f1BA25b230f8` )
2. the ability to call the `setPaused` function on pools deployed from the `StablePhantomPool` factory ( `0xb08E16cFc07C684dAA2f93C70323BAdb2A6CBFd2` )

208,"**Summary:**
> This pool uses the new composable stable pool factory which allows us to apply the protocol fee to yield bearing tokens. bb-rf-aWETH is `Beets Reaper Aave Boosted wETH`, which means we're using a linear pool to deposit weth into a Reaper WETH Vault which only deposits into Aave. Reaper handles the autocompounding of any OP rewards which adds additional yield. For reference, Reaper is a fork of Yearn v2 run by the Byte Masons who are talented developers in their own right. BeethovenX has a close working relationship with the Byte Masons. In the absence of an Aave v3 compatible atoken wrapper this arrangement represents the best path forward, and arguably it's better than using a wrapper since we get the additional compounding benefit. The kind of vault we're using has held 9 figures of TVL and been thoroughly battle tested so it should add a negligible risk premium. Combined with the wstETH staking yield this pool will be one of the highest ETH yields available, even before incentives.

**Protocol Description:**

> wstETH is liquid staked ETH. bb-rf-aWETH is Beets Reaper Aave Boosted wETH.

**Motivation:**

> We intend to become the number one liquidity destination for wstETH on Optimism. This pool is the cornerstone of that strategy - we will roll out additional pools with wstETH to help drive trading volume. This pool is also a great showcase for the power of boosted pools. It's time to show the world the power of yield. 

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Find more information about governance on Lido's [forum](https://research.lido.fi/).   

2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on a rate provider for wstETH which the Orb Collective integrations team graciously deployed. See [here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9aa3cd420f830E049e2b223D0b07D8c809C94d15).

3. **Audits:** See [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits).

4. **Centralization vectors:** See [here](https://lido.fi/faq) for information on this.

5. **Market History:** See [here]([https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth)). 
 
6. **Value:** We will earn the protocol fee on wstETH and bb-rf-aWETH yield. As a reminder, protocol fees on Optimism are split 50% to Balancer (passively to DAO & veBAL) and 50% to BeethovenX. Of BeethovenX's 50%, half is returned as incentives on Optimism pools either via bribes or direct LM. The other half is split between funding the team and accumulating veBAL/auraBAL/vlAURA per this [recent proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x3d6e0373f0f1c041a82e6108a01aee2e00a21be43667259126b70e5fd2a5f93a). Thus emissions towards this gauge both benefit passive veBAL *and* serve to help our flywheel accelerate our growth on Optimism.

209,"### PR with Payload
https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/754

**Summary & Motivation:**

The direct incentive infrastructure for Balancer pools is managed by the Balancer Maxis to facilitate rewards provided by partners as opposed by BAL from the gauge system. This is done via reward injectors which take a recipient list schedule that takes mainly the gauge address, amount of rewards per week, and number of weeks. Once an injection is executed; it adds the number of rewards per week to a gauge contract to be streamed to stakers.

During the most recent adjustment to the injection schedule for the [ggAVAX/wAVAX pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/avalanche/pool/0xc13546b97b9b1b15372368dc06529d7191081f5b00000000000000000000001d), the GoGoPool team requested to stream 4000 GGP over 4 weeks, at 1000 GGP per week. The transaction (can be seen [here](https://snowtrace.io/tx/0x6b1cf6ebcd19bca140c10a32d8e02d50957f6aae5b76ad1a080fdf621e8318dc?chainId=43114)) executed by the team was incorrectly configured and sent the full amount of 4000 GGP to the injector over a 1 week period which resulted in an undesired outcome for reward distribution.. To compensate the GGP team for this misconfiguration, we propose to supply the difference in incentives of 3000 GGP equivalent in BAL from the treasury at the time of execution.

This proposal requests Balancer DAO to provide 6545 BAL to be swapped to GGP and be distributed over the next 3 weeks as direct incentives to the ggAVAX/WAVAX gauge as the GoGoPool team intended. In order to facilitate this timeline; the Maxis pooled 1000 GGP to continue the injection cycle this upcoming week to not cause a break in emissions and poor user experience. The request is for a total of 6545 BAL to cover the the total 3000 GGP is to be sent to the LM Multisig for distribution.

**Future Mitigation Measures:**

The Maxi team was aware of this issue moments after it occurred and attempted to mitigate it by requeuing the recipient list in an effort to correct the misconfiguration prior to the inject sending funds to the gauge. This was done just several minutes late for the firing time, and it was clear to all team members that refining our process around internal communication, transaction loading, and transaction review must all be further improved. Diligence by all parties involved can and will be improved in coming weeks. A combination of tooling, scheduling, automation, and accountability will be pursued to improve everyone on the team’s transaction handling going forward.

**Specifications:**

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `transfer` on the BAL contract `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d` with the recipient as the LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` amount of 6545 BAL (`6545000000000000000000`).",neutral
210,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes UniWhale ($UNW) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re pleased to announce a new Syrup Pool with UniWhale! 

UniWhale is an oracle-based decentralized perpetual exchange, where users can trade BTC, ETH, and other top cryptocurrencies with leverage.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn UNW tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 2,000,000 UNW
 - **Distribution duration:** 90 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1005 UTC on 22 Mar 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1005 UTC on 20 Jun 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.7716 UNW

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the UNW Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a UNW-BNB farm.  


The farm will have 0.2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.1x rewards after that. During and at the end of the 90-day period – approx. 1005 UTC on 20 June 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 0.1x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $UNW?

From the team: “UNW is the utility token of the UniWhale ecosystem that can be traded and transferred. UNW allows users to stake and participate in the distribution of its trading fee revenues and token emissions.

Users can convert UNW into esUNW (Governance token). With esUNW, users can participate in the project's governance.”

#### To learn more, visit the project’s official channels:

211,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

Firstly, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to farms – the per block allocation to Farms and Lottery will remain at [**~2.01 CAKE/block**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics).

Importantly, the purpose of these proposals is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. In other words, redistributing farm rewards from the farms mentioned below will boost APRs for all other farms. 

By boosting APRs for higher-performing farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more capacity to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

Travala.com has published a proposal for the Venus community to integrate XVS as a payment option on their website. 

This partnership would provide significant benefits for the Venus community by expanding the utility of XVS in the real world through travel bookings. The marketing support and exposure provided by Travala, along with the convenience of booking with preferred cryptocurrencies, would further enhance the integration's appeal. 

Travala's established presence in the travel industry, with major partnerships and a Best Price Guarantee policy, offers a strong foundation for this collaboration. 

By leveraging Travala's platform, Venus can tap into a large user base that is already accustomed to using cryptocurrencies for travel bookings. The proposal's focus on boosting XVS's utility and accessibility aligns well with the strategic vision of both the Venus community and Travala.

216,"#### Proposal to Direct CAKE Emissions to Locker Protocols
![](https://i.imgur.com/B8wbReP.jpg)

In order to help bootstrap the veCAKE ecosystem and improve CAKE incentive efficiency, The Kitchen is proposing to redirect a portion of current CAKE emissions to participate in the veCAKE locker ecosystem (i.e., provide CAKE as bribes for strategic pools).

**Note:** no increase in overall CAKE emissions will occur under this proposal. Strategic pools include high volume and revenue driving pools such as: BNB-USDT, USDT-USDC, BTC-USDT, BNB-ETH, ETH-USDT, among others.

#### Summary: Redirection of CAKE Emissions to Bribes

The Kitchen is proposing to make the following modifications to current CAKE emissions:
* Reduce current emissions going to farming pools by 500 CAKE per day (from ~29,184 to ~28,684 CAKE per day).
* Allocate this 500 CAKE per day to participate in locker protocol bribes
* If this is successful in directing greater emissions to high volume pools to grow liquidity, then the Kitchen may request a larger amount in the future. The Kitchen will track these efforts to determine success based on pool volumes, TVL, and capital efficiency.
* This will not impact the deflationary status of CAKE as no emissions have been added or removed, only redirected.

How bribes will be allocated:
* The Kitchen will allocate bribes on a per epoch basis (i.e., every 14 days).
* The bribes will be distributed between any locker protocol built on veCAKE, including Cakepie, StakeDAO, and Hidden Hand.
* Bribe allocation will be based on bribe efficiency to get the best return on CAKE used in this effort. If the difference in bribe efficiency between locker protocols is within 10% of each other, then bribes will be split evenly among them to maximize value across the ecosystem and minimize risk. 

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and a portion of CAKE will be redirected to bribe across locker protocols.",neutral

221,"#### ABSTRACT

ApeClub is a social network for the ApeCoin & Yuga community, which was launched only several weeks ago. In such a short period of time we have managed to attract nearly 300 BAYC holders, proving that our community is very strong and eager to integrate.

We’ve received many positive reviews and amazing feedback from community members, which encouraged us to double down on our efforts and request an ApeCoin DAO grant to accelerate our growth.

Our goal is to unite us, the entire Yuga holders community (BAYC, ApeCoin, MAYC, BAKC, Otherdeed), on one platform giving you the following value:

- Enhanced ApeCoin utility both for signup and in app features
- New relationships through meeting fellow Apes in your area
- Feeling welcome in any country worldwide, by meeting Apes while you travel
- Create business relationships with other Apes across the world
- Easily organize and attend Ape events
- Promote projects you are working on and collaborate with other community members on their projects

We feel that our platform will perfectly complement The Otherside.

#### OVERALL COST

Our operations currently consume on average $88,000 per month. We would like to request funding for the next 9 months of operations at an increased burn rate of $125,000 per month in order to achieve the goals mentioned above.

This will give us the fuel needed to onboard & satisfy the needs of the Yuga holders community, and explore various means of monetisation to fund future development and maintenance.

So our total grant request is 225,000 $APE.

#### PROPOSAL

223,"***EDIT: Risk Labs Treasury has offered to provide the loan of 10K BAL tokens for the relayer.  So the proposal is being modified to only request 40K BAL tokens to be deposited into Across BAL LP from Balancer Treasury.***

This proposal suggests that Balancer treasury use 40,000 BAL to enable fast, cheap, and secure bridging between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism via Across Protocol (website: across.to ; Twitter: @AcrossProtocol).

**Motivation:**

Balancer currently is using Multichain for this bridging. Due to the design of Multichain, BAL tokens are getting stuck in destination chains due to bridging flows, and thus not allowing users to easily go back and forth between L1<>L2 and between L2’s.

For example, right now, the state of the Multichain pools are:

Ethereum: 484;

Optimism: 41,287;

Polygon: 18,728;

Arbitrum: 20,328

**note that 20k BAL was very recently added to Polygon and Arbitrum via BIP-37, so those are still close to original balances. The BIP-3 proposal that added 20k to each of Ethereum and Optimism is now completely out of balance with only ~1% of the supply remaining on Ethereum. This means users cannot exit to Ethereum until a bridger comes along to rebalance the pools!*

This has also made some bridging routes extremely expensive or not even possible.

For example, right now, if you want to bridge 100 BAL from Optimism to Ethereum. The charge to the user is 12% (they only get 88 tokens on the other side). If BAL was on Across, the charge would be 0.12%, which is 99% lower. The user would get 99.88 BAL on Ethereum instead of the 88 BAL offered by Multichain.

Also, if you wanted to transfer more than 484 BAL, it wouldn’t be possible. With Across, you could transfer up to the entire amount sitting in the relayer in 1-4 minutes, which is likely ~7,000 BAL (I’ll explain more about the relayer under specifications). And you could transfer the *entire amount available in the liquidity pool* within 2-4 hours, which is likely ~30,000 BAL! (subject to utilizations; it could be much more if other depositors participate in the LP).

**Extra Protocol Incentive (Referral Program):**

Across recently launched a referral program where referrers and referees are rewarded in (pre-launch) $ACX tokens.

Currently the rewards rate is between 40-80% of bridge fees being rebated back to the referrer/referee. There is an additional 2X boost bonus being paid at the moment as well. Since $ACX does not exist yet (but coming soon), the amount is calculated using $0.10 price (100mm FDV).

You can read more details on Across Doc site under 'Referral Program'

Balancer could add a link to Across on their site and earn referral rewards to the Balancer Treasury for everyone that bridges using Across. Note also the bridgers will share a portion of this reward as well.

**Risk:**

All the ‘typical’ smart contract risks. You can read the Across (v2) and other UMA audits here:  https://blog.openzeppelin.com/?s=UMA.  The UMA Optimistic Oracle (OO) is used to settle any disputes if/when they occur.  The OO has been battle tested on 100’s of millions (soon to be > 1B) worth of assets. Across itself just passed $500MM in transfer volume. It has been integrated into the front-ends of Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Boba.

**Specification:**

***
Add 40K BAL tokens to Across BAL LP as per the following steps:

1.  Get HubPool address from https://docs.across.to/v2/developers/contract-addresses/mainnet-chain-id-1

2. Approve HubPool contract to spend the right amount of BAL

3. Call addLiquidity on the HubPool contract https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/blob/master/contracts/HubPool.sol#L454

4. This will give them LP tokens back.

***

Across works using (1) relayers and (2) liquidity pools.

1. Relayers: The relayers facilitate fast bridging (1-4mins typically) by providing a short term loan to the bridger on the destination chain upon validating the bridgers deposit on the origin chain. The relayer is reimbursed by the liquidity pool (assuming the transfer is not disputed). The dispute period is 2hrs. Think of the relayer as providing ~2-4hr loans over and over.
2. Liquidity Pools: The liquidity pools are reimbursed what they pay the relayers once the bridger’s deposit on the origin chain makes its way over that chain's canonical (“official”) bridge, which typically takes 7days. Think of the liquidity pool as providing 7day loans over and over. Anyone can deposit BAL into the Across BAL LP.

It is our suggestion that Balancer treasury use 40,000 BAL to fund an Across BAL LP to set up bridging on Across.

Relayer: 10,000 BAL will be provided and used by Risk Labs (the foundation that built UMA and Across) to run a relayer.  Since the relayer is permissionless, if Balancer is comfortable running their own relayer, they are more than welcome to do this in the future. You can read about how to run a relayer here: https://docs.across.to/v2/developers/running-a-relayer

Liquidity Pool: Balancer Treasury will deposit 40,000 BAL into an Across BAL Liquidity Pool. It is able to be withdrawn at any time (assuming it is not being utilized. ‘Utilized’ means it is in the canonical bridge en route back to Ethereum, which can take up to 7days.).

**Case Study of Actual BAL pool on Multichain:**

Looking through the BAL pool on Ethereum in Multichain, it looks like it supported 34 transfers (14 withdrawals) over a period of 53 days, and is now effectively shutdown (since there is only 484 BAL available). The sizes of the 6 withdrawals over 1,000 BAL were: 12,323; 9,494; 3,740; 2,225; 1,688; 1,339. The other 8 were all < 1,000.

Given the relayer allocation I proposed above, if Balancer was using Across, all 14 withdrawals would have no trouble being completed, and most importantly *the relayer would be totally rebalanced within 2-4hrs and be ready to do more transfers*! For 12 of the 14 transfers the users would have received their BAL on Ethereum in 1-4 mins. For the 2 biggest transfers, it would have taken 2-4hrs. Since these transfers occurred over a period of 53 days, the Across LP would have been totally replenished ~7x. Said another way, with the same seed amount of 20k BAL, Across could have supported 140,000 BAL (7 x 20k) worth of transfers and restored back to original conditions vs Multichain only supported ~34k and is now effectively turned off until a bridger comes along to rebalance their pools.

The Balancer treasury currently has 80k BAL tokens in Multichain. If they switched to Across, the treasury could take back 40,000 tokens, be able to support >5x the volumes at a fraction of the cost, and always be operational.

Across also could do all of this at ~0.12% on each transaction. Right now, the Multichain fee on moving 100 BAL to Ethereum is 12% (100x more!).

![|624x288](upload://1eQeppVHQObOO2whuSXCdRX6pRY.png)

Out of fairness, the Multichain fee to move 100 BAL to Optimism from Ethereum is 0.10%. If Balancer treasury wanted Across to only be 0.10% (or lower) that is easy to do, Balancer could just specify a lower LP fee (explained in next section). It’s about striking a balance between low bridge fees for your users vs high BAL APYs to attract external LPs. Depending where Balancer treasury wants to be along that curve, we can set the LP fee model accordingly.

Fees:
Across has 3 fees in its system:

1. LP Fee: Fee paid to liquidity providers for proving passive liquidity that is utilized by the system to refund relayers. This fee is configurable via a rate model. Balancer treasury can specify what they would like it to be. Obviously, the higher the LP fee, the more the LPs make on each transaction, but the more expensive the transaction is to the user. We would suggest a 5% LP APY fee, which effectively results in the bridger paying 0.09% on each transfer. Our rate model does have an Aave style feature that at high utilizations of the LP, the 5% number will increase (in order to preserve some liquidity in the system), but this amount and slope of increase is configurable.
2. Relayer Fee: Fee paid to incentivize relayers to relay your bridge transaction quickly. This is currently 0.03% and gets paid to the relayer that fills the transfer.
3. Destination Gas Fee: Fee paid by bridger to cover the gas cost on their destination chain. Obviously going to a L2, this number will typically be quite small. Going to Ethereum, it’s subject to gas prices and can vary.

The ~0.12% total Across fee mentioned earlier is (1) + (2) = 0.09% + 0.03% = 0.12%. This number will be higher when going to Ethereum as fixed gas costs scale up quickly as a percentage of the transfer amount when the transfer amount is sufficiently small.",bearish

226,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to BNB Chain v3 Farm Rewards

As we continue to optimize CAKE rewards across all of our deployments, we are able to gradually lower the overall CAKE emission, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate a smooth trading experience. Ultimately, this enables us to contribute a greater amount of CAKE towards the weekly burn. 

The previous round of [**Adjustments to Farm Rewards**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x411b3e231d1da0c21890580449328c9a5a9cc50d1d0c7a33daab90df584779a4) increased the overall CAKE burn by approximately **1,700 CAKE per day** with minimal impact to trading volumes.

Given the traction and overall market share shown on our BNB Chain v3 deployments, this proposal aims to decrease emissions to the farms listed below and increase the overall CAKE burn by approximately **680 CAKE per day**.

These optimizations will add up over the coming months to 1) improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across farms and 2) redirect CAKE rewards towards the highest growth farms, ultimately accelerating the path towards ultrasound CAKE.

#### Adjustment Details

With the above in mind, we are proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below. Note, all other BNB Chain v3 farms will continue to earn the same level of rewards and even with these adjustments, the farms below will continue to have a healthy level of liquidity, volume, and APR.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their average daily volume, 14-day volume, capital efficiency, and alternatives available.

title: [ARFC] TokenLogic Hohmann Transfer
author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative
created: 2023-10-05
---

## Summary
This ARFC proposes the inclusion of TokenLogic in the ""Orbit"" delegate platform initiative for a period of 90 days, with a monthly compensation of 5k GHO and total budget of 15k GHO.

## Motivation
TokenLogic has been an active and valuable participant in the Aave ecosystem. While they were initially eligible and considered for the Orbit program, they opted to explore the possibility of becoming a service provider to the DAO. However, given their recent decision to re-organize internally and re-evaluate their proposed scope as a service provider, it's appropriate to reconsider their inclusion in the Orbit program.

## Specification

### TokenLogic Inclusion

- TokenLogic will be recognized as an official delegate within the Orbit program for a period of 90 days.
- They will receive a monthly compensation of 5k GHO, totaling 15k GHO over the three-month period.

### Funding and Emissions

TokenLogic's compensation will be in line with the Orbit program's guidelines, ensuring fairness and consistency with other delegates.

### Responsibilities and Conditions

- TokenLogic will actively participate in Aave governance, representing their delegators and contributing to the protocol's growth.
- If TokenLogic presents and successfully passes a proposal to become a service provider to the DAO, their Orbit funding stream will be terminated to prevent double compensation.

## Disclaimer
The Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The inclusion of TokenLogic is based on their merits and contributions to the Aave community.

## Next Steps:

1. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

## Summary

Proposal to add gauge support for the LUCHA/wMATIC pool on Polygon with a 2% cap:

* LUCHA 80%
* wMATIC 20%

## Protocol Description

Luchadores is an NFT collection and associated auto battler game, started originally on Ethereum. It features 10 000 Luchadores NFT, each of which can be played in the game.

Since the start, the Luchadores team has adhered to a “purist” ideal: the NFTs are fully onchain (svg art), attributes were allocated with provable randomness thanks to ChainLink VRF, and the game itself will live onchain too.

#### A flash of Luchadores history

Luchadores NFT - *mint_init 17/05/2021; mint_end 18/08/2021*

The Luchadores NFT were launched on 17 May 2021, with 10 000 Luchadores mintable for 2 LINK (VRF price) + gas costs in ETH. It took about three months for the full collection to be minted, with a sizable interest spike as the end of the mint was approaching.

##### **LUCHA token launch** *23/12/2021*

In December 2021, the LUCHA token was released on the Polygon network. 6,18% of the total supply was allocated to Luchadores NFT holders over 1 year. The amount of LUCHA tokens earned daily per Luchadores NFT owned depends on their rarity. Other incentives were distributed for tournament winners (prizes), and soon to be earned in the game.

##### **Piñatas *pinata_1_init: 31/01/2022; pinata_1_end: 01/02/2022***

Piñatas are ERC-1155 NFTs on Polygon containing random accessories for Luchadores. The first round of piñatas sold out in less than two days, as fellow Luchadores were hungry for gear.

##### **LUCHA_yield_extension** ([LIP-2](https://snapshot.org/#/luchadores.eth/proposal/0xd775ac6b9872533485de12e0b937909e8b9dc913cda77a8ff0addf65c543d4e4)) 15/12/2022

The daily yield allocated to Luchadores holders was extended for a one-year period with the LIP-2 vote

##### **LUCHA_yield_clawback** ([LIP-3](https://snapshot.org/#/luchadores.eth/proposal/0x117c3ba2abc60b9e52c26eaf00e8861c71aa42511999153789da3fb679461299)) *21/02/2023* & **POL_strategy** *24/03/2023* ([LIP-4](https://snapshot.org/#/luchadores.eth/proposal/0xef78874686c2cab4a16b72c0f95536d0be5fc755d8254e9bac1b0e21da2131d0))

14 months after the token release, and because of the LIP-2 results, the DAO decided to redeem the unclaimed $LUCHA of the first year and use it to fund the POL strategy.

2,25% of the total supply was retrieved (over the 6,18% for the first year rewards) and allocated to liquidity and vote incentives.

##### Tournaments

To date, 3 tournaments have been organized, offering a unique opportunity for Luchadores to prove their skills in the arena. Interested players can register their Luchadores, select their desired statistics and skills, and that’s it!

The grids are generated randomly; the matches are played automatically, and the player can check the results of his Luchadores the next day. Luchadores who perform well in tournaments can earn piñatas, LUCHA, accessories, and even Luchadores NFT.

***VRF full on-chain game, Independent team, no pre-mint, no team allocation.***

### Motivation

After more than one year of existence, the LUCHA token is now widely distributed; with the Fight-to-Earn component launch approaching, the team is also looking to improve the liquidity situation beforehand.

Thanks to LIP-3 and LIP-4 votes, the total liquidity available on the pool increased massively, with the vast majority of it being protocol-owned. The **LUCHA/wMATIC Balancer pool is already the main pool to exchange the token**, and its importance will accrue.



Side/Arbitrage pools are also available: 
- [ComethSwap LUCHA/wMATIC](https://charts.cometh.io/pair/0x5e1cd1b923674e99df95ce0f910dcf5a58a3ca2d)

- [Satin Exchange LUCHA/CASH](https://analytics.satin.exchange/pair/0x55f70935f4e8dd194bc2d56fb1c4d25db599cbc5) 

The Luchadores DAO owns a majority of the LUCHA-WMATIC LP (87% of the TVL is POL) and will accumulate & relock the rewards earned to build strategic holdings which will be used to vote on the gauge and sustain the strategy voted on [LIP-4](https://snapshot.org/#/luchadores.eth/proposal/0xef78874686c2cab4a16b72c0f95536d0be5fc755d8254e9bac1b0e21da2131d0).

Additionally, the LIP-4 also approved a budget to create vote incentives on Warden Quest to attract more veBAL & other wrappers voting power while building the DAO voting power. Independent vlAURA holders have also expressed their intent to support the voting on the gauge if obtained in its early days.

The governance is also considering switching the LUCHA staking model to a veLUCHA one, where holders can stake (and, if they want, lock) LUCHA/wMATIC BPT tokens to earn MASK, the non-transferable in-game currency, BAL rewards, and other benefits.

*Note: The initial post for this gauge was the [[BIP-242]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-242-enable-lucha-wmatic-gauge-polygon/4566/), which is resubmitted on this proposal. Considering the last results, there were discussions between the Luchadores Team, the Balancer Maxi and Aura delegates to share more informations on the project & the goals of this proposal for the Lucha DAO.The Balancer Maxi and Aura delegates are amenable to a new vote.*

### Specifications

1. **Governance**: There is no on-chain governance as the game and the token are still at an early stage. Voting via Snapshot covers treasury and token-related decisions, executed through a 2/4 multi-sig. As development progresses, the game and its related infrastructure will be increasingly on-chain (Polygon).
2. **Oracles**: The Luchadores do not rely on external oracles.
3. **Audits**: The LUCHA token is a standard ERC-20 token
4. **Centralization vectors**: The multisig mentioned above is the main centralization vector in the current stage. While the Luchadores NFT is built for resilience, the LUCHA token requires more guardrails until the game is finetuned and fight to earn is launched.
5. **Market history**: After significant volatility at first, the LUCHA price stabilized while the initial supply was being distributed.
6. **Value**: This pool is already the primary source of liquidity for the LUCHA token and is expected to scale up significantly as veLUCHA staking and locking are introduced.

title: Polygon Market - wMATIC Risk Parameter Changes
status: Proposal
author: @MatthewGraham @afromac
created: 04/11/2021

ARC: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-polygon-market-wmatic-risk-parameter-changes/6021

## Simple Summary
We propose adjusting two (2) MATIC risk parameters on the Aave Polygon Market: LTV and Liquidation Threshold.

## Abstract
This proposal updates two MATIC risk parameters on the Aave Polygon Market to align with the Moderate risk level chosen by the Aave community. Index Coop has compiled the following analysis for Gauntlet and the broader Aave community to review.

## Motivation
Updating the MATIC parameters seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

## Specification
The criteria for assessing market risk, as determined by the market size and changes in fluctuation in demand, is presented by the Aave community here. In line with the criteria, analysis of the MATIC token on Polygon network is presented below:

wMATIC Polygon Market Risk (Polygon Network Data)

Holders:	168,102	B+ to A-	B+
Transactions	100,240,631	A	
Mkt Cap	586,568,252	B+ to A-	
Av. Vol.	$50,675,854	C+ to B-	
Norm. Vol	0.06579	C+ to B-	

The MATIC token risk score compiled by Index Coop is B+. This matches the risk score cited here 1. However, the volatility score of B- (C+ to B-) is justified by the 0.06579 score compared to 0.064 in the table presented in the documentation 1. Further to this, assets like BAL and BAT on Ethereum have similar vol characteristics to wMATIC on Polygon. The Norm. Vol parameter is the average of the t=30 days and t=90 days as shown in the below table.

wMATIC Volatility Data (Polygon Network Data)

Time	S.D Vol
t=7 days	0.08475
t=30 days	0.06535
t= 90 days	0.06622
t= 180 days	0.09013
t= 365 days	NA

Based upon the volatility data share above, Index Coop suggests changing the Liquidation Threshold and Loan to Value parameters as shown below:

**Title:** [ARFC] Introducing ""Frontier"" - Staking as a Service for the Aave DAO

**Author:** Marc Zeller - ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

**Date:** 2024-01-15

---

## Summary

The Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) introduces ""Frontier,"" a 'Staking as a Service' product for the Aave DAO. This service aims to further decentralize the protocol's staking exposure and actively participate in network security. ACI will operate staking nodes and run validator nodes on behalf of the DAO, enhancing the DAO's passive income and promoting a diversified staking strategy.

## Motivation

Transitioning from simply acquiring Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) like stETH and rETH to actively running validator nodes, ""Frontier"" represents a significant step towards greater involvement in Ethereum's network decentralization and security. 

For this trial experiment, we propose to run 32 Stader minipools of 4 ETH.

This proactive approach will allow the Aave DAO to host community members in our minipools, providing them with staking exposure through ETHx.

## Specification

To initiate ""Frontier,"" we propose the creation of a 2/3 multisig controlled by:

- Aci.eth
- Tokenlogic
- Karpatkey

This multisig will be funded with 128 wETH, enabling ACI to set up 32 validator minipools on behalf of the Aave DAO.

**Benefits:**

- **Enhanced diversity**: The Aave DAO has been a pioneer in LST diversity, staking as a service can allow the DAO to increase this diversity with new ecosystems and assets that are not necessary onboarded on main pools yet.
- **Increased alignment**: Most DAO in our ecosystem to generate a passive income on their ETH holdings acquire stETH and call it a day. The Aave DAO was the first to actually push for diversity by adding exposure to rETH.

This ARFC proposes to take our ETH-alignment a step further by being the first ever DAO actually to run nodes. by operating minipools, the DAO reinforce its synergies with other protocols such as stader, and directly increases these LST alternative market shares by allowing passive investors to acquire ETHx (1 wETH stake by the DAO allows for 3 ETH to be “staked"" via ETHx)

The Aave DAO always pioneered and led, and we hope to inspire in the ecosystem; this is why this new service is named “Frontier.” (also as a reference to Ethereum's early days).

**Guarantees and Risk Mitigation:**

- **Yield Guarantee:** ACI will ensure a consistent yield, equivalent to the 'regular' ETHx returns, regardless of the actual performance of the nodes. mitigating Aave DAO performance risk.

From experience, while Yield is consistent over infinite timeframes and/or deposits, DAOs and humans have the bad habit of not having infinite time and money.

“Solo staking” or “minipool staking” are needed for decentralization, but when placed on the wrong side of variance, it can lead to underwhelming returns. As Frontier grows overtime this effect will be smoothen out, until then, ACI is confident in managing financial risk, even when luck isn't on our side. We are aligned and focused on long-term outcomes.

- **Slashing Protection:** ACI commits to covering any potential losses due to slashing, safeguarding the Aave DAO's wETH funds.
- **Stader SD Token Provision:** In partnership with Stader, ACI will obtain the necessary SD tokens, enabling the DAO to engage in staking without direct exposure to the SD asset.

This will remove all need for directional exposure to the SD token for the Aave DAO. The ACI will use related rewards to participate in Stader governance aligned with its “meta-governance” mission.

## Next Steps

1. If Snapshot Stage outcome is YAE, to mitigate governance burden, and reduce the amount of governance AIP, Aave Finance will be requested to include the staking multisig funding in their next treasury management AIP.
2. Implement ""Frontier"" by setting up the validator minipools

## Disclosure

The ACI, independently initiates ""Frontier"" without external compensation.
If Frontier is approved, The ACI will receive the necessary SD tokens to operate Pools from Stader.
The ACI already operates Ethereum validators, Rocketpool, & stader Minipools privately.

```

**Protocol Description:**

ether.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.

ETH staked through the ether.fi liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on ether.fi automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols. 

The eETH contract has been live since June 2023, with eETH launching to the open market on November 15th, 2023, and has approx. 515k ETH held within it. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.

Through these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.

**Motivation:**

ether.fi is looking to seed a weETH/rETH pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for weETH on Arbitrum. Incentivising a Balancer pool will continue to boost the liquidity of the LRT on Arbitrum. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the L2 DeFi ecosystem. 

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** - Currently, the protocol utilises a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed ether.fi executives. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token.

2. **Oracles:** - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the ether.fi team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however as the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee.

* The exchange rate feed for weETH-ETH on Arbitrum has been deployed by Chainlink. 

3. **Audits:** - Audit reports for the ether.fi protocol are found on the GitBook page - [Audits - ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits). The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.

4. **Centralization vectors:** - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team at ether.fi, however this will be upgraded with the implementation of the ether.fi DAO and governance.

5. **Market History:** - eETH was first deployed November 15, 2023. Market history and protocol information can be found here on the ether.fi Dune dashboard - https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi

6. **Value:** - The weETH/rETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum. The pairing of eETH with rETH will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers.

## Protocol Description:

**About Inverse Finance**

Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a DAO and started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.

Inverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;

* On the supply side of money markets, such as DAO-owned protocol FiRM, by Inverse Finance's “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.
* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA/FraxBP (currently $42.5M TVL), DOLA/USDC on Velodrome ($17.2M TVL), and soon to be DOLA/USDC and Balancer (replacing the DOLA/bb-a-USD pair that was killed due to a [disclosed bug](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1611363559685898247?s=20&t=4e6cn2cPCda1i1jWMfuWRw)).
* Via purchase with DAI stablecoin using[ The Stabilizer](https://www.inverse.finance/swap/DAI/DOLA).

DOLA is not ""algorithmic"" and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.

**About Coin98**

Coin98 is a DeFi product builder focusing on creating and developing an ecosystem of DeFi protocols, Web3 applications, and NFTs on multiple blockchains. Our mission is to fulfill untapped demand and enhance in-demand utilities in the DeFi space, helping people to access DeFi services effortlessly. The Coin98 universe is now consolidating Coin98 Super App, Coin98 Exchange, Coin98 SpaceGate (cross-chain bridge), Coin98 Dollar (CUSD) and many more incubating initiatives.

Coin98 Dollar (CUSD) is a fully-backed stablecoin that aims to become a cross-chain unit of account that fulfills the demand for cross-chain liquidity in DeFi.

In order to convert to 1 CUSD, a total of $1 worth of the collateralized assets must be sent into the CUSD Reserve smart contract. Specifically, in the initial phase, the collateral ratio to convert to 1 CUSD will be $1 worth of fiat-backed stablecoins - BUSD (on BNB Chain) and USDC (on Solana and Ethereum).

## Motivation:

This proposal aims to add the DOLA/CUSD pool to the Balancer Gauge controller.

CUSD is a stablecoin recently launched by Coin98. Coin98 has a wide range of products, including Coin98 Super App (aka Coin98 Multichain Wallet) that has 6 million users worldwide, especially popular in the Asia region, and is the best multichain wallet that supports more than 70 blockchains, including EVM and non-EVM chains.

Adding a gauge to this LP will onboard Coin98 and its users to the Balancer and Aura ecosystem via CUSD stablecoin, and consequently, get them to experience all other pairs available on Balancer. This also provides a platform for Coin98 to build and release further products and integration for CUSD on the Ethereum blockchain.

Both Inverse Finance DAO and Coin98 will jointly incentivize liquidity to the pool, allowing CUSD to access the already deep liquidity of DOLA.

This is a continuation of the already established partnership between Inverse Finance DAO and Coin98, with a jointly incentivised DOLA/CUSD pool already active on Thena, currently with a TVL of $2.5M and 7-day volume of $700k.

## Specifications:

You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.

>1. Governance: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.

**About Inverse Finance**

Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to pools such as the DOLA/FraxBP[ Curve](https://curve.fi/factory/27) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.

**About Coin98**

The CUSD protocol governance structure is currently managed by:

0x1db6ad727ae60d7b4dbee81f79c4bcbcff8759f8 - CUSD

0x6fd5991da792f09ed0ed0e9327f4c5164c66e1f3 - CUSD Mint Burn

Coin98 team has been maintaining the CUSD protocol with these addresses to ensure a smooth transition toward decentralization while having proper product development progress in the initial phase.

We have plans to decentralize the CUSD governance system via C98 token in the future.

>2. Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

**About Inverse Finance**

Inverse Finance’s new fixed-rate money market, FiRM, uses Chainlink price oracle for its WETH and stETH market. Inverse Finance's old lending market relied on both Chainlink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable.

**About Coin98**

No.

>3. Audits: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

**About Inverse Finance**

As part of our renewed smart-contract review process, Inverse Finance hosted [a bug bounty contest](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-10-inverse-finance-contest/) on the Code4rena platform to conduct a comprehensive audit of our fixed rate lending protocol, FiRM. Inverse has also recently expanded its bug bounty program by [launching a vault](https://app.hats.finance/vaults) on the Hats.finance platform. FiRM contracts were also reviewed by boutique auditing firm DefiMoon, who have been our [official security partners](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/new-security-layer-a-welcome-to-the-defi-moon-team) during Q4. In addition to providing security consulting and auditing services for FiRM, DefiMoon has also played a role in our recent deployments of [FraxBP Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/66), [Aura Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/71), and [Velo Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/68). In the immediate aftermath of our price manipulation incident, Inverse had hired leading security firm PeckShield in Q3 to perform an audit of our renewed INV oracle, as well as our [bad debt repayment product](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/How%20Inverse%20Is%20Thinking%20Outside%20The%20Box%20on%20Frontier%20Debt%20Repayments). Their report can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWNG08mib2GcI1WqnMt5IdFoW73QU2F8/view).

The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. An announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).

**About Coin98**

Security has always been our top priority since the beginning of product development There for Coin98 Dollar (CUSD) had been audited by multiple organizations such as SlowMist, PeckShield & Inspex previously before launch. All audit records can be found [here](https://docs.coin98.com/audits/coin98-dollar).

>4. Centralization Vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

**About Inverse Finance**

Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:

* Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.
* Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.
* Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 8 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.
* Fed Chair: 2 of 5 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts.

Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).

**About Coin98**

The CUSD protocol is currently managed by the Coin98 team. We have a plan to decentralize the protocol management in the future, starting with a multi-sign approach for the contract keys managed by multiple contributor groups.

>5. Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume

**About Inverse Finance**

Inverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the “Feds”, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLA’s Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. Please see our graph below of DOLA’s peg YTD.

Currently, the deepest liquidity pool for DOLA stablecoin is DOLA/FRAXBP on Curve, with a TVL of $41.8m at the time of writing.

**About Coin98**

Coin98 launched CUSD in September 2022. CUSD is a fully-backed stablecoin that you can redeem at 1:1 ratio for the collateralized assets in the smart contract, which currently supports USDC & BUSD.

CUSD has maintained a stable price with liquidity pools on multiple blockchain (Kyberswap Elastic for Ethereum, Baryon Network on BSC & Saros Finance on Solana) with no significant price change events. There was a price deviation display error on Coingecko, but it got fixed immediately.

239,"**Title:** [ARFC] Onboarding wstETH to Aave V3 on Base Network

**Author:** @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative

**Date:** 2023-11-12

It may sound harsh, but when it comes to crypto, let’s tickets, for example, the FTX situation. That is solely on the individual as far as responsibility goes, and on top of that they are receiving compensation, as there is a class action lawsuit.

I lost money from celsius, as well as Voyager when they defaulted, but did not go asking for handouts because I knew it was my responsibility, and it would be unethical to ask other people for money as well.

Last, our community would look a lot more professional, with these posts, not existing, and the voting options and proposals only consisting of matters related to pancakeswap and it’s actually technical features, impossible upgrades, etc.

there are plenty of crypto websites, and the apps, the victims of the Ukrainian, famine, and you name it that will provide relief to these people if they are actually suffering from what they claim to be. However, those organizations actually check and verify we’re all aware of how many scammers there are in the scene right now as it’s more now than ever.

**Title:** [ARFC] Onboard osETH to Aave V3 on Ethereum 
**Author:** ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-03-11

---
## Summary

This is a ARFC proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s new over-collateralized staked ETH token, osETH, on AAVE V3 Ethereum.

## Motivation

Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) have proven to be popular collateral assets on Aave, with Lido’s stETH the largest Reserve across all Aave deployments and rETH quickly reaching its supply caps. As productive assets, LSTs are high quality collateral to borrow against. Given their high correlation to ETH, LSTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.

osETH in particular is overcollateralized by design, providing in-built slashing protection and consequently an increased level of protection for the Aave protocol…

As StakeWise V3 provides solo stakers to ability to mint osETH against their own nodes, on-boarding osETH will benefit Aave, StakeWise, and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, and be an important step in the pursuit to diversify Ethereum staking and encourage staking from home.

The onboarding of osETH will consequently create increased osETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and StakeWise protocols, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of osETH.

## Chain to be deployed/listed

Ethereum mainnet

## Specification:

osETH contract address:

0x Labs would like to gather signal from the community on support for the proposed Metatransaction and Multiplex upgrades as proposed in [ZEIP-96](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/96).

## Scope

The forum post on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-96-metatransactionsfeaturev2-and-multiplex-upgrades/3543](https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-96-metatransactionsfeaturev2-and-multiplex-upgrades/3543).

In summary, the proposed changes will provide two main benefits: (1) improve gas efficiency of the metatransaction feature and (2) enable OTC order formats to be included in multihop transactions that would expand the sources of liquidity that can be considered and make meta-aggregation more price competitive.

A subsequent vote (ZEIP-96) will be conducted if this temperature check is successful to integrate the proposed smart contract changes to the `exchangeProxy`.

247,"## Introduction/Abstract

On April 18th the funding of the Balancer DAO for Q2 was ratified [[1](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xe05bc1a898797cd8f78f86bed25bac84efade2df1a959daee09f8dd7c69d3b36)]. As part of the proposal 21,250 BAL and $127,500 USDC was requested for contributor compensation. With the recent market downturn the ops multisig does not have sufficient BAL to pay the expected June Balaries (See here how discounted veBAL compensation is calculated [[2](https://balancergrants.notion.site/Compensation-cb303e0241d94d96bed110929947029d)] ). The proposal is to:

* ops subDAO Multisig [[3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325#tokentxns)] swaps its remaining USDC (expected to be 76892 USDC) after USDC Balaries for June with the treasury for the additional BAL required to pay out June Balaries in BAL (expected to be 22805 BAL ). This amount of BAL was calculated based on a BAL price of $3,66 on June 18th. After June has commenced the remaining BAL in the ops subDAO multisig will be sent back to treasury.

## Motivation

Preservation of USDC available for the Balancer DAO can be the prudent choice in the current market conditions. Therefore a swap of BAL (from the DAO treasury) <> USDC (from the ops subDAO Multisig ) with the Balancer DAO treasury would retain USDC on the DAO’s balance sheet and manage to pay the Balaries for June for people who are looking to get their Balary as discounted $veBAL.

## Risks (if applicable)

* While the ops subDAO made best efforts to poll contributors for their expected Balary, the official determination will happen at the end of the month via our monthly health-check.
* BAL price falls below 3,66 by the end of the month and a new proposal needs to be voted on to request the additional $BAL due to the decreased price of $BAL.

## Specification

* ops subDAO ( 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325 ) sends 76892 USDC to Balancer DAO treasury.
* Balancer DAO treasury ( 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f ) sends 22805 BAL to the ops subDAO multisig.",bullish

Title: [ARFC] Framework for ARFC and TEMP CHECK Proposals
Author: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative
Date: 2023-06-27
---

## Summary

This framework provides comprehensive guidelines for the Aave DAO community when creating and voting on ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) and TEMP CHECK proposals. It includes a template for crafting proposals and outlines the quorum and voting requirements.

## Motivation

### Distinction Between TEMP CHECK and ARFC

TEMP CHECKs serve as ""temperature checks"" to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.

Conversely, ARFCs are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.

### Proposal Template

Each proposal **must** include the following sections:

A header:
1. **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for the proposal, including the proposal type (ARFC or TEMP CHECK) in a [TAG] format.
2. **Author**: The name of the author and/or entity creating the proposal.
3. **Date**: The date the proposal is being made, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

A proposal body:

1. **Summary**: A succinct summary of the proposal.
2. **Motivation**: A detailed presentation of the proposal and potential benefits for the Aave protocol. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
3. **Specification**: A comprehensive description of the proposed change, including any relevant parameters or risk considerations. For ARFCs, this section should be technical, detailing the specific changes to be made. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
4. **Disclaimer**: Any necessary disclaimers, such as conflicts of interest or third-party involvement.
5. **Next Steps**: The proposed next steps if the proposal is approved.
6. **Copyright**: A statement defining proposal copyright. While Open-Source is **mandatory**, the choice of a specific license is left to the author.

### Voting Guidelines

1. **Vote Start Time**: The vote should commence 24 hours after the proposal is published on Snapshot.
2. **Proposal Age**: The governance thread related to the snapshot vote should be at least 5 days old before voting begins.
3. **Vote Duration**: The vote should last for a minimum of 3 days.
4. **Vote Options**: The vote should have at least three options: YAE (Yes), NAY (No), and ABSTAIN.
5. **Quorum**: The vote should reach a quorum of 320,000 YAE votes.
6. **Differential**: The YAE votes should exceed the second-largest vote option (either NAY or ABSTAIN) by at least 80,000.

### Proposal Cycle:

![image|1920x920](upload://fPsMYVukUCZ2OFHwDUzkFUgc9dw.jpeg)

### Special Considerations

This framework should be considered as a general template for general proposals. Specific proposals and/or frameworks, such as asset onboarding or caps updates, should follow specific guidelines as determined by the Aave DAO community.

This framework is designed to ensure that all proposals are thoroughly considered and that all votes are fair and representative of the Aave DAO community's views.

## Specification

As this proposal pertains to governance guidelines, it does not require any on-chain action or protocol change.

## Disclaimer

The ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.

## Next Steps 

1) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2) If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted.

As a team of very passionate ApeCoin DAO & Yuga community members, we want to play our part in the success of ApeChain. And we will not only support it, but even amplify it.

Introducing Blever, a cutting-edge web3 platform combining NFTs with social farming & incentivized content creation. The platform empowers teams to effortlessly bring their creations to life while enjoying unparalleled hype & attention. By leveraging social login and seamless FIAT payments, Blever provides easy access to ApeChain not only for experienced users but also for casual players and retail.

In addition to gaming, you also need fun, culture, memes, and PFPs to make ApeChain appealing and popular. Blever is designed to do just that. We see ourselves as an extended community-driven business development arm. We search for projects, support their launch, and bring them tremendous reach and engagement through social farming. Everyone wins!

With $APE being the native gas token of ApeChain we believe that bringing users/traffic/projects to the chain is probably the single most important thing the DAO can focus on in the near future.

**Driving demand for ApeChain = Driving demand for $APE**

Easy access to ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE Incentives on ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE More use cases on ApeChain → more use cases for $APE ApeChain hype → $APE hype

This is our biggest opportunity and we want to do everything we can with Blever to make the most of it.

Having already invested more than 2 months of our time and resources, we are now looking for funding from the DAO to help us achieve our goal. Let’s make ApeChain a success together

# Summary:

Enable a Balancer gauge for the paUSD/stataPolUSDCn (ECLP-paUSD-USDC-rh) E-CLP with a 2% cap on Polygon PoS.

paUSD is crypto-backed USD stablecoin issued by the Parallel Protocol.

stataPolUSDCn is the wrapped, static version of the rebasing Aave lending deposit token for aPolUSDCn on Polygon PoS.

The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP). E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.

# Protocol Description:

### Parallel Protocol

The Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol) is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon PoS and Fantom. Stablecoins (PAR & paUSD) are decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro/USD fiat currency.

# Motivation:

The role of the paUSD/stataPolUSDCn E-CLP pool is to increase the stability of paUSD and as well as its on-chain liquidity.

The capital efficiency of E-CLPs will help to quickly bootstrap a liquidity network for paUSD. This hub-and-spoke network will enable a liquid secondary market for paUSD & stataPolUSDCn to make it easier to exit from/ enter into paUSD.

By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for paUSD & stataPolUSDCn. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:

* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.

### A few notes:

* PAR (the Parallel EURO stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Polygon: [2eur (PAR)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x513cdee00251f39de280d9e5f771a6eafebcc88e000000000000000000000a6b)
* paUSD (the Parallel USD stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Ethereum: [e-cs-kp-USD ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x01536b22ea06e4a315e3daaf05a12683ed4dc14c0000000000000000000005fc)
* Mimo Labs has started building positions in AURA (±554k $vlAURA) & BAL and the Parallel [Protocol treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b) currently holds 23k $vlAURA.
* Mimo Labs is still buying AURA which will be locked to incentivize the liquidity.
* MIMO (the Parallel governance token) already gauges on Balancer Ethereum & Polygon: [p-MIMO/WETH 80/20](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x3dbb91bdd5fc74c49146819ed58d7d204cf5a016000200000000000000000cfb) / [MIMO/WETH 80/20](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xee3959fd00a0b996d801fc34b7ce566bd037f5f500020000000000000000063e)

# Specifications:

1. Governance:

* Parallel Protocol: none on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a ⅝ multi-sig (4 team members and 4 dao members [elected](https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/governance/dao-multisig) by vMIMO holders).
  * Polygon PoS: 0x2046c0416A558C40cb112E5ebB0Ca764c3C5c32a

  * Fantom: 0x174162ddecE9d0b7B68fd945e38c3372C4C818ba
* Aave ; stataPolUSDCn: Aave has onchain governance (more [here](https://docs.aave.com/governance))

2. Oracles:

* Parallel mainly uses Chainlink price feeds for all its collateral assets.
* stataPolUSDCn:
  - rateProvider (for stataPolUSDCn ): [0x7d10050F608c8EFFf118eDd1416D82a0EF2d7531](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x7d10050F608c8EFFf118eDd1416D82a0EF2d7531#code)
  - allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying.

title: [ARFC] Add CRV to Ethereum v3
Author:@Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham), @dydymoon
Dated: 2023-02-01

---

# Summary

This proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard CRV to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

# Abstract

CRV is a strategic asset to Aave and any CRV earned from the pool could be used by Aave to create veCRV for the purpose of bootstrapping the adoption of GHO, the new staked aToken being developed by @AaveCompanies and in the long term, might help incentivize the Safety Module too.

The risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the [initial forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum.

By presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.

# Motivation

Listing CRV on Aave v3 Ethereum compliments the community's recent on-market purchase of CRV to [repay the excessive debt](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-repay-excess-crv-debt-on-ethereum-v2/10955) created on v2 Ethereum. CRV is a material contributor to Aave’s revenue through the continual borrowing demand for CRV. Month on Month revenue has fallen significantly as a result of disabling borrowing on the Ethereum v2 deployment.

![|602x361](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jSbcyMZwGNrjEqPMIvbDcOE3ietLQ7rRlhQ6mZBaOfKG1JqGmja0Go6vE1KaUcVNM5Y6FiSBvXnNlj_i46gMo6LmAOnyPlpsgRBVRVtRvc2Zm3Lw1-NhE0lMZqHLEOsu2U8NqH3TMtxIKFvi30H1-w4)

There is strong ongoing borrowing demand for CRV due to the veTokenomics and the extrinsic use cases created by Convex Finance and projects built on top of veCRV. The chart below shows how freezing the CRV on [Polygon v2](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/124/) and disabling boring on [Ethereum v2](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/125/) during late November 2022 has affected deposit rates on Polygon v3. The Polygon v3 deployment is the only liquidity pool with Borrowing enabled, as a result there has been notable volatility in deposit rates.

![|602x193](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zp1IEca82kVsME-0-eMHhlakx58hbkG-3a10rCZX1eZE9Gll3Zpe6ocvSnpfnowIzML6p0_k3SkBBAExdoKN6icLKygWW7eOi7tRiDuz6785miZx8aRDRjrj3fNWT8U_sXgFv5qVhVQCHc9nPuoHNUY)

By listing CRV on Ethereum v3, with Borrowing Enabled and a suitable BorrowCap users will have the ability to migrate from v2 to v3 and borrow CRV, generating revenue for Aave. Any CRV earned by Aave can be used to create veCRV, assuming Aave has access to the Curve voter escrow contract, which can then be used to vote CRV incentives to any combination of pools chosen by the community. How the CRV will be used is open for Aave to discuss and implement via a future proposal.

For listing CRV, this proposal uses risk parameters suggested by Gauntlet on the original [[ARC] Aave v3 Ethereum Deployment: Assets and Configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) post. The interest rate curve parameters have been sourced from @Llamaxyz’s [[ARFC] CRV Interest Rate Curve Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-crv-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/11337) post, which is soon to be presented on Snapshot for voting.

### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard CDCETH to Aave V3 on Ethereum
### Author: Jlok & ACI
###  Date: 2024-07-15

---
### Summary:

This proposal is to explore community interest in adding [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH CDCETH) to Aave V3 on the Ethereum mainnet. CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.

### Motivation

[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet. As of June 2024, [Crypto.com (http://crypto.com/) has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.

[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform. 

To enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) introduced a Liquid Staking Token (LST) - [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).

Currently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues. 

Other liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers. 

The liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.

Integrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded.

Confidential banners/listings on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.
Onboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH & Aave adoption & increased revenues for both parties.

### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments

 [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.

Integration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.

### Specification

Contract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e
Rate Provider contract for current exchange rate:
0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)

260,"Dear Community,

BSCPAD-BNB LP was selected as part of the batch for multiplier reduction this week.
It was reduced from 1.0 to 0.1.It used to earn ~190% APY, now it is reduced to ~30%.

BSCPAD has great utility as the governance token for BSCPAD launchpad. There are predefined amounts that you can stake to acquire higher levels when participating in new token launches. The BSCPAD-BNB pool is a great place to keep your excess BSCPAD tokens that are momentarily not contributing to increasing your launchpad level.

Please consider increasing the multiplier either back to 1.0 or at least to 0.5 to help out users accumulating BSCPAD between their launchpad levels.

263,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-fund-vested-payments-for-ballers/2128).

The Ballers are a group of passionate Balancer advocates whose primary goal is to build an engaged community around the protocol. That can take many forms and I encourage anyone who wants more context to give this update I recently published a quick read: [https://davis-ramsey.medium.com/the-ballers-summer-update-b3fd24cf55b9](https://davis-ramsey.medium.com/the-ballers-summer-update-b3fd24cf55b9)

## Motivation

Recently Fernando suggested we increase the “Ballery” from 100 BAL/month to 500 BAL/month with 60% long term vested (1y cliff, 1y linear vest period via Sablier) and 40% liquid. This was met with broad support on an informal basis. Ballers have the option to take a full or half Ballery and you can see the current breakdown of who’s taking what here: [https://www.notion.so/63091677228841de9fa909139e60362f?v=a7852fc9da684a5a834934e5215edd6d](https://www.notion.so/63091677228841de9fa909139e60362f?v=a7852fc9da684a5a834934e5215edd6d)

This is the most members the Ballers have ever had, and commensurately I expect the program to execute and deliver positive results in the community more effectively than we ever have. It is important to have oversight and to be accountable for the spend - the grants committee is 3/5 Ballers so we wanted to avoid the appearance of impropriety by going to them.

On that note, grants committee members also get paid 200 BAL per month liquid. Given I selected a full Ballery for myself and I also plan to serve on the grants committee, I will forfeit my grants payment back to the grants pool as a full Ballery alone is a significant amount.

## Specification

The liquid portion of the Ballery has been fully funded for the next 3 months, we only need to fund the vested portion of the payments this time. **Three months from now, I will make a proposal to fund both the liquid AND vested portions for the following three months.**

We need 5,400 BAL to fully fund vested Balleries for the next 3 months. I think it’s also important for the Ballers to have a spending fund we can use to reward community members who distinguish themselves on an ad-hoc basis and to run some community events like the POAP design competition. **Thus I will ask for an even 6,000 BAL with 5,400 going towards vested Ballers and 600 going to the Baller spending fund** (requires 2 ballers to agree, I custody funds secured by my ledger wallet).

I will coordinate setting up the vesting contracts with Fernando.",bullish

270,"Summary 

The proposal to list weETH assets on Venus Protocol offers significant benefits to the Venus community, including the opportunity to add Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT) from ether.fi on ETH Mainnet. 

Users can stake their ETH, earn rewards, and enjoy additional benefits through restaking on EigenLayer. With approximately $2.7B in TVL already deposited into the ether.fi protocol, the addition of weETH to Venus can enhance asset diversity and liquidity on the platform.

By integrating weETH, Venus allows users to earn ether.fi
and EigenLayer points for future incentives, along with lending APY on their holdings. 

The proposed liquidity mining incentive offered by Ether.fi for weETH suppliers demonstrates a commitment to jumpstart the market on Venus and attract more users. This move positions Venus as a pioneer in capturing the restaking market, catering to the growing demand for LRTs and providing users with a wider range of opportunities. 

Overall, listing weETH on Venus Protocol aligns with the community's focus on decentralization, sustainability, and doing what is right for the Ethereum ecosystem. The proposal not only enhances asset diversity and liquidity but also strengthens the collaboration between Venus and ether.fi to drive innovation and value creation for users.",bullish

**Summary:**
> Balancer recently passed going forward with deployment on zkEVM [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-224-balancer-on-polygon-zkevm/4539). Given their launch, it is in the Balancer's best interest to add core liquidity on zkEVM and to support this with the approval of several gauges. This proposal will activate gauges for the following pools if passed: wstETH/WETH , rETH/WETH, rETH/wstETH, bb-o-USD (Ovix boosted) , bb-o-USD/rETH and bb-o-USD / wstETH. This pools all contain yield bearing assets and in turn will be added to the core pool cycle.

**Protocol Description:**

> The LST pools in this proposal are reiterations of pools Balancer has on several networks outside of the Ovix boosted addition. The 0VIX protocol enables users to effortlessly lend, borrow and earn interest with their digital assets. Depositors providing liquidity to the protocol may earn passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow using over-collateralization. The lending market is where boosted yield will be sourced from. 

**Motivation:**

> These pools will act as the initial base of liquidity for Balancer's zkEVM expansion. 

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Ovix governance is outlined [here](https://docs.0vix.com/dao/governance-dao-charter). Pending their token launch. 

2. **Oracles:** The rate providers utilized in these pools are powered by layer zero  and have been reviewed by the Balancer Labs integrations team.

Gauge Proposal Template:

**Summary:**
>Ankr proposes to the Balancer community the creation of a wstETH/ankrETH Gauge.
ankrETH is a form of ETH Liquid Staking from Ankr Staking that offers instant liquidity for your staked ETH, enabling you to connect your ankrETH tokens with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards.
Ankr is a leader in RPC nodes with projects like Aave, 1inch and SushiSwap as clients and has ~$200M TVL across the Liquid Staking Offering.

• Telegram: Contact @ankrnetwork

**Protocol Description:**

> Ethereum Liquid Staking as provided by Ankr Staking offers instant liquidity for your staked ETH, enabling you to connect your ankrETH tokens with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards.
ankrETH is a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 ankrETH token vs. ETH increases over time as staking rewards accumulate.


**Motivation:**

> The purpose of this proposal is to allow ankrETH/wstETH so as to qualify for BAL incentive distribution in order to deepen the liquidity on Balancer and allow for users to swap ankrETH, the ETH Liquid Staking Asset, for ETH.
The intuition behind this is to remedy the capital inefficiency associated with providing liquidity since ankrETH is generating a yield from the Staking Rewards of ETH. As a result, users have an opportunity cost when providing liquidity since the other half of the ETH they provide does not generate any yield.
In addition to this, part of the staking rewards will be taken in order to perform auto-bribes on Hidden Hand in order to further utilize BAL incentives and Swap Fees in order to mitigate this capital inefficiency effect.

**Specifications:**
 
>1. **Governance:** ANKR token-holders can propose and vote for changes to the Ankr Staking system. If a change receives enough votes, the Ankr team implement the agreed-upon changes to the platform. Further information may be found here: ANKR Governance Mechanics – Ankr
>2. **Oracles:** Does not apply
>3. **Audits:** Ethereum Liquid Staking smart contracts have undergone an external audit by Beosin Blockchain Security. The full audit report may be found below:
[Ethereum Liquid Staking – Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/eth/overview/#audit-details)
>4. **Centralization vectors:** Centralisation Vectors: The Ankr 2.0 whitepaper introduced the vision for Ankr Network as a decentralised system where independent node operators work alongside Ankr nodes to power the growth and development of Web3. Further detailed information may be found here:

https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/118
**Summary:**

The bb-ma2-USD pool is a Composable Stable Pool that facilitates trades between three US Dollar stablecoins (USDC, USDT and DAI). These are each wrapped through Morpho-Aave v2’s market, providing LPs with additional yield.

We propose adding a gauge to this pool.

**Protocol Description:**

Morpho-Aave is a peer-to-peer layer built on top of Aave. It is a lending pool optimizer: it improves the capital efficiency of positions on lending pools by seamlessly matching lenders and borrowers peer-to-peer. By doing so, Morpho-AaveV2 enhances the rates of AaveV2 while preserving the same experience, liquidity, and parameters (collateral factors, oracles, etc.) as the underlying pool.****

USDC is the dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Circle. USDT is the dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Tether. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO. 

**Motivation:**

The Morpho-Aave boosted pool enhances Balancer's capacity to improve capital efficiency through linear and boosted pool architecture. While Aave has been commonplace for Balancer boosted pools in the past, the bb-ma2-USD pool enables LPs to access improved yield compared to the original bb-a-USD pool. Encouraging liquidity on the pool through gauges will leverage this improved yield, making it even more appealing for LPs. This will ultimately result in better trading conditions for the three stablecoins.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** Morpho-Aave Core contracts are owned by a 5/9 multisig safe with a 24-hour timelock. Multisig decisions reflect the choices of the Morpho token holders. A 3/9 multisig can execute quick, non-critical actions, such as pausing a market when required. For more information on Governance, see [this page.](https://docs.morpho.xyz/usdmorpho-token/governance)
    
    USDC and USDT are centralized and do not have governance forums. DAI is collateralized by [MakerDAO.](https://makerdao.com/en/)
    
2. **Oracles:** Morpho-AaveV2 relies on the same oracles as AaveV2, used in bb-a-usd.
3. **Security:** 
    - [Audits:](https://docs.morpho.xyz/security/audits) The protocol has been audited numerous times by the best audit firms in the world
    - [Bug Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/morpho/): Moprho has a Bug bounty of $555,555, live since 17 June 2022
    - [Formal Proving](https://docs.morpho.xyz/security/formal-proving): Morpho formally proves its contracts using **[Certora](https://www.certora.com/)** and Morpho Labs’s internal formal prover.
4. **Centralization vectors:** USDT and USDC are inherently centralized.
5. **Market History:** See USDC [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/%5D(https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin)), USDT [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether), and DAI [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai).
6. **Value:** LPs will earn the yield on the idle liquidity deposited on Morpho-Aave. LPs & Balancer will earn the swap fees. Note that the Morpho-Aave protocol does not take any fees.

279,"Background
- Pancakeswap's DAO governance is considering altering Pancake Gold allocation rate. On December 1st, 2023, a newly approved function was implemented where 5% of swap volume fees are converted to $gCAKE. $gCAKE has the potential to increase swap transaction volume and reward holders, but will $CAKE face market cap reduction if a derivative token supply is increased, or will the increase in bridge volume contribute to greater value for users. 

Proposal
- Increase $gCAKE from 4% of swap fees to 8% swap fees to further incentive swap usage and reward the Pancakeswap community. Maintain $gCAKE biannual rewards distribution timeline to incentive swap prioritization and bolster market sentiment. Currently, for every $1M of swap fees generated, $50,000 will be allocated to the $gCAKE treasury. This proposal is suggesting to contribute $75,000 to $gCAKE for every $1M of swap fees, which will later be distributed to DEX users based on wallet activity. A majority vote of 51% or greater is required for the protocol to implement this new addition. 

What is $gCAKE and when is the first distribution?
- Pancakeswap DAO has voted to implement $gCAKE rewards for the first distribution which is live for users from December 1, 2023 to December 15, 2023. Each $CAKE holder is eligibility if their wallet is older than 7 days and they have made a txn with $CAKE. $gCAKE distribution rate will be based on wallet solvency levels and bridge volume. 

If you haven't already, check [HERE](https://gold-pancakeswap.org) if you are eligibility for the Phase 1 $gCAKE Rewards Distribution. 

Execution
- If this proposal receives a majority vote of 51% of greater, $gCAKE treasury allocation rate will be increase from 4% to 8% to further reward swap users and hopefully increase overall swap volume. 

If the new rewards allocation rate is accepted it will be implement in the 2024 Q2 distribution. 

Don't forget to check if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gCAKE distribution if you have been an active $CAKE trader and DEX user.

**Summary:**
Renzo Protocol proposes a Balancer Gauge for a ezETH-wstETH pool on Arbitrum, with uncapped emissions. This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.

* Dune Dashboards: https://dune.com/maybeYonas/renzo-protocol

**Protocol Description:**

[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer

Renzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.

Renzo introduces the Balancer Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.

**Motivation:**

Renzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.

**Specifications:**
 
Governance:

Renzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.

Oracles:

Renzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.

Audits:

Renzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)

Centralization vectors:

Centralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.

Market history:

Renzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a). Both pools are in the top 6 on Balancer on Ethereum by TVL.

Renzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects.

Value: The ezETH/wstETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum.

## Protocol Description

> ETHx is an ERC-20 token by Stader, a non-custodial liquid staking platform with [$650Mn+ TVL](https://defillama.com/protocol/stader) across Ethereum, Polygon, Bnb, Hedera… ETHx represents staked ETH; that appreciates in value over time due to the staking rewards and is represented in the exchange rate. Created to improve accessibility & support decentralization of Ethereum by allowing anyone to spin up a validator with just a 4 ETH bond (the lowest in the industry and 80% lower than solo staking), ETHx is currently at [$400M+ TVL (130K ETH)](https://dune.com/stader_labs/ethx-general-metrics) across [4,000+ validators spread over 250+ Node Operators](https://dune.com/stader_labs/node-operator-dashboard)

> stETH is a rebase token by Lido that also represents staked ether but instead of the exchange rate accumulation method, the staking rewards are given as extra stETH. Effectively, stETH always stays pegged 1:1 with ETH and stETH token balances are updated when the oracle reports the change in the total (initial deposit + staking rewards) every day. wstETH is the wrapped version of regular stETH which allows for stETH accumulation in the contract and turns the rebase model of stETH into the C-token model of other LSTs

## Motivation

> As an LST player, Stader is always on the lookout for more avenues to improve the liquidity depth in the market and it's Arbitrum's turn now. Driven by cheap gas & faster execution, L2s are the perfect avenue for DeFi and Arbitrum is slated to hold it's pole position amongst L2s; courtesy of the huge user base. Stader intends to capitalize on that growth trajectory and expand its current set of Balancer pools to Arbitrum to access the massive base.

## Specifications

1. **Governance:** Stader’s governance is led by the Stader DAO - a wide variety of $SD holders who participate in key decisions pertaining to the protocol. Here are the [Stader Governance Forum](https://forum.staderlabs.com/?_gl=1*3ops13*_ga*ODUwODI0OTEyLjE2NDkzMzkzOTE.*_ga_RJZMMEBJQ5*MTY4ODM5NDk2Mi4xNDMuMC4xNjg4Mzk0OTYyLjAuMC4w) & [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/staderdao.eth#/staderdao.eth) 

   ETHx has an Oracle Node Operator Genesis Committee of 7 distinguished community members composed of top validators and esteemed Ethereum community members. You can learn more about the ETHx ONO committee[ here](https://snapshot.org/#/staderdao.eth/proposal/0x704905672648882c229480d501ab7d59da94ade47762eda163e7a3919082b044)

3. **Audits:** Stader’s audit reports from Sigma Prime, Halborn & Code4rena can be found [here](https://staderlabs.gitbook.io/ethereum/ethx-security/audit-reports)

4. **Centralization vectors:** Stader is a non-custodial & decentralized liquid staking solution based on DAO governance. $SD is Stader’s native governance token. ETHx is based on the foundation of decentralizing Ethereum with permissionless node operators getting the majority of the TVL

   The ETHx contract upgrades are managed by Admin time-lock contract with a 6 on 9 Multi sig (2 Stader members and 7 external members) as the proposer. Composition of the committee can be found [here](https://www.staderlabs.com/blogs/ethereum/staders-ethx-now-live-on-mainnet/)

   You can learn more about how Stader envisions embracing the path of decentralization [here](https://blog.staderlabs.com/embracing-decentralization-for-ethx-5f863704b07)

5. **Market History:** ETHx, like all of Stader’s prior LSTs went live with redemptions enabled from Day 1. So, the ETH is not locked and can always be redeemed by unstaking & withdrawing on Stader Dapp anytime which ensures the peg at all times and can be observed [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stader-ethx)

6. **Value:** This is a Core Pool which will generate revenue for the DAO via the ETHx yield and through swap fees once the pool scales to a considerable TVL that can drive substantial trading volumes

288,"Title: [ARC] Add Support for cbETH
Author: @Fig Lead Governance Contributor at Flipside Crypto, with additional support from @AndrewA, a Protocol Specialist at Coinbase
Created: 10/27/2022

-------------------------------------------------------------

This Snapshot vote  is a temp check to add support for Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) to Aave v3 on Ethereum mainnet, once live. 

v3 offers unique features such as isolation mode, capped supply & borrowing, and e-mode which affords the community more optionality.

If passed, and once v3 is live on Ethereum, this will trigger a formal risk review by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs. Parameters will be set leading up to an AIP based on the findings of the risk managers.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Summary

This is a proposal to add Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) to the Aave protocol on Ethereum mainnet. cbETH is an ERC-20 compliant token on Ethereum that represents underlying staked ETH on the Coinbase platform.

Motivation

cbETH is a liquid staking token for ETH created by Coinbase with a goal of facilitating a more competitive liquid-staked ETH landscape.

There is a meaningful amount of demand for borrowing against liquid-staked ETH. Liquid-staked assets (such as cbETH) make for efficient collateral with underlying margins typically improving over time.

Specifications

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

@Fig is a Governance Contributor at Flipside Crypto, a leading delegate on Maker, Aave, Optimism, and Hop. Additional support provided by @AndrewA, who is employed by Coinbase. Andrew and Fig also help review grants as part of the Aave Grants DAO.
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

Coinbase is supporting liquid staking for its ETH stakers with Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH), where the staked asset is Ether (ETH), and the staking provider and token issuer is Coinbase. With cbETH, Coinbase aims to contribute to the broader crypto ecosystem by supporting high-utility wrapped tokens and open sourcing smart contracts.
cbETH follows the cToken model, which allows it to be ERC-20 compliant and easier to integrate with DeFi more broadly. cbETH can be unwrapped for staked ETH plus accrued rewards net of Coinbase staking fees and any network-imposed penalties. Rewards and penalties affecting Coinbase staked ETH change the conversion rate between cbETH and underlying staked ETH.

3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

With maturing volumes, integration of cbETH would allow those that have staked their ETH with Coinbase to borrow against their locked positions while continuing to earn rewards on the underlying staked ETH.
The introduction of cbETH into the Aave ecosystem could bring a new wave of retail users who learn about Aave through Coinbase and holding the cbETH token. Many of these new customers may become regular users of the Aave protocol.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO, is it live? Products, are they live? How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Coinbase, Inc. (Parent company NASDAQ: COIN) is a prominent cryptocurrency trading platform in the United States. As of 6/30/2022, the company and its global affiliates had 103M+ verified users, $96B assets on platform, and offered services in 100+ countries [source 1]. Coinbase is allowing customers who stake ETH to wrap it for an ERC20 utility token called Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (“cbETH”), which is a liquid representation of their staked-ETH.
Coinbase’s mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. In pursuit of this mission, Coinbase builds products to improve access to economic freedom, cbETH being one of these projects.
With ETH staked on Ethereum being illiquid and unstaking not being available until post-Shanghai, liquid staking solutions have been a natural development.

5. How is the asset currently used?

cbETH allows users who have staked with Coinbase to sell or transfer the ownership of their staked ETH. cbETH is currently traded on Uniswap, Curve, and the Coinbase trading platform.

6. Emission schedule

There is no emissions schedule. Customers who have staked ETH with Coinbase can wrap their staked ETH to obtain the cbETH token.

7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

Key roles of the contract:
    1. oracle  - updates the conversion rate for the token. Coinbase controls the oracle's address and updates the ‘exchangeRate’ every 24 hours at 4pm UTC. This update cadence may be changed in the future. 
    2. master Minter - can assign minters and their limits
    3. minter - can mint and burn tokens
    4. pauser - can pause all transfers, mints, and burns for the contract
    5. blacklister - can blacklist an address from transferring, minting, and burning
    6. owner - can assign all roles except the admin’s
    7. admin - can upgrade the contract, and re-assign itself
All privileged keys are controlled by Coinbase using best practices

291,"# Simple Summary

A proposal to grant Chaos Labs and Gauntlet the authority to provide final recommendations and approve the use of the Grace Sentinel via the Aave Guardian.

# Motivation

In response to a reported security threat identified in the Aave bug bounty program on November 4th, 2023, the Aave Guardian has taken the precautionary measure of pausing several pools on both Aave V2 and V3. A comprehensive governance discussion detailing the events and the measures implemented can be accessed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v2-v3-security-incident-04-11-2023/15335).

A governance proposal has been initiated to address and rectify the identified vulnerability. If approved, this proposal will facilitate the unpause of the affected pools.

In preparation for the unpausing of the pools, @bgdlabs has developed the Liquidations Grace Sentinel mechanism for Aave V2, designed to be activated by the Aave Guardian. The primary objective of this mechanism is to safeguard users who were unable to refill or repay their positions during the pause, protecting them from liquidation upon the resumption of normal protocol operations.

[quote=""bgdlabs, post:26, topic:15335""]
Whenever an asset is paused, no action can be done on it by design of the Aave protocol, including liquidations. Once the asset gets unpaused, all actions will be available again, which means that positions that couldn’t be refilled or repaid before, would be under immediate liquidation conditions. The Liquidations Grace Sentinel is a type of emergency oracle (Aave Guardian controlled) that allows to activate a “liquidations grace period” for any asset listed in a pool.
*Whenever this grace period is on, even with the asset unpaused, liquidations involving it will not be allowed*.
[/quote]

# Specification

This proposal suggests authorizing the DAO risk providers (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) to **recommend the grace period and approve the use** of the Liquidations Grace Sentinel by the Aave Guardian. V2 is planned to be unpaused on November 13th, 2023.

The recommendations and unpause plan will be communicated via the Aave governance forum and executed accordingly via the Aave Guardian.

For reference, market risk analysis has been provided by Gauntlet [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v2-v3-security-incident-04-11-2023/15335/37?u=gauntlet) for the community’s consideration.

# Next Steps

1. Due to the time sensitivity of this proposal, we will follow the Direct-to-AIP framework, utilizing Snapshot as the voting platform.
2. A Snapshot will be posted immediately.
3. If the Snapshot passes, the proposal will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted.

292,"**Introduction**

Tracer DAO has recently rebranded to Mycelium and expanded its strategic direction as part of a recent [governance proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0x2f2103cc31a01e36f94d488ae5c3ea9a9d57b5f4543a8897fe2d74c9f8c3ec7c). Balancer has and will continue to be a significant part of the Mycelium ecosystem. With the Perpetual Pools, Balancer serves as the secondary market for pool token and we are building tools that will leverage BLP tokens to aggregate stable coin and other assets to serve as collateral in Perpetual Pool markets. 

Next week, Mycelium is releasing a Perpetual Swap product. The product is a generalised fork of GMX. If you’re familiar with the GMX model you are probably aware of their liquidity token, GLP. Mycelium will be releasing MLP which is effectively a yield bearing index of stablecoins and bluechip crypto tokens that acts as the universal counter-party for leveraged traders. MLP will introduce a number of new assets relative to GLP, one of which is BAL. BAL will be used in the MLP pool to collateralise trader’s long BAL positions, which are executed at the oracle price with no slippage. The MLP pool will also act as an AMM allowing traders to buy and sell BAL. 

The token weights in the pool are adjusted to help hedge the holders of MLP against trader open positions. For example, if a large number of traders are long BAL, the MLP pool target weighting would be adjusted to have a higher BAL holding. Initially, BAL will have a target weighting of 1% of the MLP Pool. 

Please find more information here: [Perpetual Swap and MLP background](https://tracerdao.medium.com/mycelium-perpetual-swaps-5f0cf94a456b) 

**Motivation**

The following proposal is for the Balancer community to allocate a percentage of the BAL held in the Balancer treasury towards the MLP liquidity pool. To provide [incentives to LPs](https://tracerdao.medium.com/lp-incentives-8587a4ee7fc8), Mycelium will be targeting a 25% APR to LPs for the first month after launch. 70% of fees generated by traders will be distributed to MLP holders. These fees will be paid out to MLP holders in ETH. If the APR derived from ETH rewards is under the targeted 25% APR, the shortfall will be subsidised with escrowed MYC, Mycelium’s native token, that vests over a 6 month period. 

The goal of this proposal is to diversify the Balancer treasury, deposit BAL into the MLP liquidity pool and, earn ETH and MYC rewards. As a result, the Balancer community would generate yield on liquid treasury assets. $200,000 worth of BAL would help seed liquidity into MLP to allow traders to go long BAL in an meaningful as we launch Mycelium Perpetual Swaps.

**Risks**

* Single sided asset supplied; LPs are protected against impermanent loss seen in traditional AMM models. Despite only depositing BAL, the treasury would be exposed to every asset in the MLP pool (see the chart above).

* Smart Contract risk; Mycelium Perpetual Swap contracts are unaudited, but are a direct fork of the GMX codebase, which has been audited. GMX code has facilitated 10’s of billions in volume via their codebase and has hundreds of millions locked in its contracts.

* Oracle risk; all transactions are executed at the oracle price feed. If the oracle price feed were to be manipulated in some way LPs may realise losses. To mitigate this risk, Mycelium Perpetual Swaps is using an aggregated oracle pricing system pulling in data feeds directly from Chainlink, Binance, Bitfinex and FTX. By aggregating these feeds prices are normalised, eliminating the risk of exchange specific volatility.

* Trader’s profits; LPs are providing assets for traders to go long and short. If traders are profitable, that would cause a portion of LPs capital to be lost in the form of trader’s gains. Historically, as seen with GMX, traders have suffered consistent losses against the pools.

I’m eager to get the discussion going and hear what the community thinks.

### Specification

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will transfer 30,800 BAL (~$200k) to the LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`. From there, the BAL will be bridged to Arbitrum and deposited into MLP.",bearish

294,"Checking past lottery results its becoming widely apparent that Match 5 and Match 6 are hardly ever won.. i checked the last 20 draws and there were only 2 instances where Match 5 had been achieve and there were no Match 6.. Match 4 is also a rarity with this only being achieved by 20 tickets across 20 Draws (However 4 Draws achieved 11 of these tickets) so thats only 13 draws out of 20 where a Match 4 was achieved.
Going off the above information:
Match 4: 13/20
Match 5: 2:20
Match 6: 0/20

The Lottery win ratio for the larger prizes seems to me to be off balanced and require fixing.

Im not 100% sure the best way in which this could be fixed but potentially upping the prizes for the smaller wins (Match 1, 2, 3 and 4) - Or losing a number - Making Match 5 the Top prize (Instead of Match 6) which would also in turn make the prize pots larger for the other numbers but make Matching less numbers a bigger accomplishment.",neutral

Author: @0xlide, @SaucyBlock and ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

Date: 2024-01-18

# Summary
This publication presents the community an opportunity to add sFRAX to the Ethereum Aave V3 Liquidity Pool.

# Motivation
Staked FRAX (sFRAX) is an ERC-4626 staking vault that distributes a portion of the Frax Protocol yield. sFRAX APY attempts to roughly track the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate of the United States Federal Reserve.

Integrating sFRAX as collateral asset in the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool has the potential to create new demand for borrowable assets on Aave V3, such as stablecoins and FXS.

300,"# Summary
1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.

# Motivations
Launched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):

Total trading volume: $160B
Total swaps: 5.91M
Total users: 1.25M

1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.

The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.

In December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.

# Benefits to Aave Community

1INCH is highly liquid.
1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.
1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.
1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.

# Specification
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
RoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3

3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.

1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.

1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.

On the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

The 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.

1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.

1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.

P2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.
1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.

Supported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.

# How is the asset currently used?

1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3

#Emission schedule

The 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.

Of the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).

Uncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).

# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability

The smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.

The 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.

## General

The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.

* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.
* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.
* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.
  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.
  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.
  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.

The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.

## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:

The 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M

The 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.

The 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.

On April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.

There is an extensive list of audits available on Github.

## 1INCH Counterparty Risk:

1inch is a permissionless protocol where 1INCH holders do not have a say in how the protocol or DAO is governed.

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program.

The st1INCH token is used for governing the DAO and although there is no revenue sharing like with xSUSHI there are economic rewards/incentives for those who hold the token. st1INCH token holders receive up to 100% of gas expenses refunded, depending on your stake size. Under this program, 1INCH tokens are distributed as a gas refund to Ethereum users who stake 1INCH tokens through the 1INCH dApp. Borrowing 1INCH with the intent to receive a gas refund is a useful utility.

Users who stake 1INCH receive st1INCH which is non transferrable and used for governance. If a malicious actor was to borrow 1INCH, stake to receive st1INCH and then try attack the DAO’s treasury, then the Treasury Multisig 7 of 12 can veto the proposal during the 72 hour timelock period post successful Snapshot vote. This measure provides a level of protection for the DAO’s Treasury funds which are nominated in USDC. Any malicious attack on the DAO Treasury would not lead to the actor selling 1INCH on-market and this scenario would not create bad debt by moving the spot price of 1INCH.

301,"title: Aave V3 Harmony - Freeze Reserves
status: Proposal
author: 3SE Holdings

Simple Summary
This ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmony’s Horizon Bridge.

This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts.

Motivation
The Aave DAO Community, through the governance forum, has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users, Protocol, and DAO. (Harmony Horizon bridge exploit. Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1

This proposed action is a first step that will protect users.It will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue, by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop.

Specification
If passed, this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze() function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony. In addition, passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change (disabling supply and borrow) as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony.",bullish

## Background
The BAL for Gas initiative was introduced as a measure to entice and help users interested in trading ERC-20 tokens through the Balancer trading platform.

The introduction of the Gnosis partnership, however, will allow users to trade without requiring ETH for gas, so the gas reimbursement program becomes obsolete.

## Risk Assessment
The halting of this program might result in a reduction in trading activity, from those first-time users not familiar with Balancer inner mechanisms (claiming function and Gnosis).

305,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust twelve (12) total risk parameters across eight (8) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

In addition, we propose to enable utilizing FEI as a collateral on Aave. The initial parameters for FEI will be an LTV of 50%, a Liquidation Threshold of 60%, and a Liquidation Bonus of 6.5%. Most of the stablecoins that can be used as collateral are more liquid, and our platform's analysis recommends initially capping the amount of collateral that can be liquidatable to the average daily trading volume. If user behavior and market conditions over the coming months continue to show safe conditions for increasing capital efficiency on FEI, we shall recommend ramping up the LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus incrementally.


## Specification

This past week did not see outsized changes in market conditions nor within the Aave protocol. There were slight volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets. Our platform recommends the following set of parameter changes that will decrease liquidation bonuses on several less-utilized assets.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAL Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |
| DPI Loan To Value     | 65%     | 70%     |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| DPI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |
| ENJ Loan To Value    | 60%     | 70%     |
| FEI Loan To Value    | 0%     | 50%     |
| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 0%     | 60%     |
| FEI Liquidation Bonus    | 0%     | 6.5%     |
| MANA Loan To Value    | 65%     | 70%     |
| MKR Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| UNI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |

307,"Abstract:

Aave and Curve are two of the main DeFi protocols in constant evolution and growth with synergies between.
One way of increasing these synergies would be to give each protocol some voting power in the other governance.
A few weeks ago, i posted an ARC about a strategy using Curve to increase the revenues earned by Aave DAO. However, to benefit from the Curve system in the most efficient way, it requires to lock CRV.

Aave DAO is accumulating some CRV with the ecosystem collector, but not enough to boost the treasury from the ecosystem collector considering it’s now around 11.8M$ (or 753.3M$ including the ecosystem reserve). So how could the DAO get more CRV?

- Buy CRV using part of the funds from the ecosystem collector, but this would require approximately 850k$ to get the maximum boost on the Curve pools.

- Propose a token exchange between AAVE and CRV that increase the synergies created between both communities over the last year.

I would like to support the second option, especially because it would allow both communities to diversify their treasury without selling either Aave & Crv or spending additional stablecoins for this deal.

Treasury state:

AAVE:

Stablecoins: 1.3% of the DAO treasury worth 9.8M$
Ecosystem Reserve: 98.4% of the DAO treasury worth 741M$ in AAVE tokens
ETH/BTC & Governance tokens earned with the ecosystem collector including: 0.23% worth 2.05M$ (including CRV: 0.007% of the treasury worth 53K$)
CURVE:
Curve DAO also mostly hold $CRV with 123.9M tokens worth 191M$, there is probably other addresses with stablecoins & other tokens, but I couldn't find it.

If Aave DAO propose to exchange 2M of CRV (currently worth 3.06M$) it would cost around 10710 $AAVE from the ecosystem reserve (0.41% of the ER) at the current rates.

Purpose:

Aave and Curve are two main protocols in Defi. Both communities have aligned interests to see this exchange approved:

• Collaborate on a shared vision through governance in each other’s communities: The token exchange makes Aave and Curve governance stakeholders in one another’s communities. Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate

• Develop synergistic features: This could help create new Aave pools on Curve for the other money markets and using Curve pools as a collateral on Aave while earning Curve rewards for example.

• Positive alliance: This exchange can increase the synergies, the TVL and the revenues for both protocols. If Aave can vote to get more CRV distributed to Aave pools through the gauges, it should raise the Aave pools APR and so, increase the capital deposited in the pool which increase Curve revenues. Adding AAVE to the Curve war would also increase the difficulty for other players to increase their gauges.

Benefits for AAVE:

Be a part of Curve governance (Vote on governance proposals, gauges vote to increase the CRV distribution on Aave current and future pools)
Increase Aave DAO revenues by using Curve to deposit the treasury on boosted pools
Earn trading fees in 3CRV tokens by locking CRV 4 years
Earn EPS & other airdrops for veCRV holders
Diversify the treasury
Benefits for CURVE:

Be a part of Aave governance (Vote on governance proposals, create AIPs)
Support of the “CRV lockening” by AAVE -> Increase % of locked supply
Possibility to earn more AAVE (+BAL) by staking on the safety module
Opportunity to create a pool AAVE/StkAAVE or AAVE/sAAVE/StkAAVE
Use the AAVE tokens as a collateral
Diversify the treasury
What think the community about this? Please share your opinions on the governance forum & vote on snapshot

If Aave DAO support this proposal and think we should propose it to Curve DAO, I will post this on Curve forum to get a feedback from their community.",bullish

title: [ARFC] Optimism Create ETH E-Mode
discussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-optimism-create-eth-e-mode/13144
shortDescription: Create an ETH nomiated E-Mode on Aave Optimism v3.
author: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic
created: 2023-05-20

---

# Summary

This publication proposes creating an ETH nominated E-Mode on the Aave Optimism v3 deployment.

# Abstract

Creation of an E-Mode on Aave Optimism v3 will grant users the ability to enter yield maximising strategies with greater capital efficient.

With the introduction of an ETH E-Mode, Aave Protocol is expected to experience greater borrowing demand for wETH, leading to enhanced revenue generation.

# Motivation

Upon reviewing how several of the largest wallets holding aoptwstETH are interacting with Aave Protocol, there is a clear demand for yield generation by borrowing wETH and acquiring more wstETH to loop.

The below shows how the largest variableDebtOptwETH holder is interacting with Aave Protocol. Deposit wstETH and borrow wETH. This users generates 23.90% of the wETH debt, 23.90% of the wETH revenue for Aave DAO on Optimism. 

 ![Screenshot 2023-05-28 at 19.36.02.png](ipfs://bafkreib3bb54pvjnmi5m7yl35n3tiguvpup2beawqjci4qwvkzmpbayyju)
    
Creating an ETH E-Mode, will enable this user to borrow more wETH and also entice other users to enter into similar strategies. 

 ![Screenshot 2023-05-28 at 19.36.26.png](ipfs://bafkreidnbagdmu55ogzxfutdedkwplomcur5ky72ltljjual6ykpq6mm3a)
    
Checking on-chain liquidity, a 4,950 wstETH to wETH swap incurs 0.91%, this will enable the strategies to deleverage whilst giving back minimal yield. The wETH to wstETH swaps, increasing leverage, incur more price impact than deleveraging swaps. This will increase the pay back period of the strategy which is beyond Aave's control.
 
![Screenshot 2023-05-28 at 19.36.47.png](ipfs://QmZLvWhXTo2E7fwjVGXKyVSYbpRwWAT96FKGUkp9N8xdm2)
    
It is worth noting that the near 1% price impact swap lot size is considerably larger than existing users of Aave Optimism v3. However, this is more applicable to structured products which pool deposit capital leading to larger swap sizes.

## Oracle

There are several Chainlink oracle available:

* Exchange Rate wstETH/stETH: [`optimism: 0xe59EBa0D492cA53C6f46015EEa00517F2707dc77`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xe59EBa0D492cA53C6f46015EEa00517F2707dc77)
* wstETH/USD: [`optimism: 0x698B585CbC4407e2D54aa898B2600B53C68958f7`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x698B585CbC4407e2D54aa898B2600B53C68958f7)
    * Deployed: [2023.02.03](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x7e9fbb5524121c8bf1ec7469e51e1f973c6b619d4951db345d1dca7d659851c7)
* wstETH/ETH: [`optimism: 0x524299Ab0987a7c4B3c8022a35669DdcdC715a10`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x524299Ab0987a7c4B3c8022a35669DdcdC715a10)
    * Deployed: [2023-04-23](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xd30ad432410d8044f1359bd2428ed9bec500d57c61c504cda5f6d27f6e596b63)
* stETH/USD: [`optimism: 0x41878779a388585509657CE5Fb95a80050502186`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x41878779a388585509657CE5Fb95a80050502186)

The wstETH oracle on Optimism draws upon the price of stETH across several networks. This means the oracle is subject to what wstETH is trading at on other networks. This acts to de-risk the Optimism E-Mode as the wstETH price is not as exposed to the wstETH/ETH price on Optimism as it otherwise could have been.

Creation of the E-Mode will enable the wstETH price on Optimism to be arbitraged against the wsETH oracle price which is expected to lead to a tighter price correlation with wstETH true value. Such strategies are potential yield sources for more sophisticated users.

Something to consider is the stETH & wstETH yield is updated every 24 hours. This affects the exchange rate wstETH/stETH. The stETH oracle is also spot market based and not calculated. This created [caution](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x0ddd9784d8ac59ffcabc8ce86d2993179e044eeb102df1644b5b58d04ff25e63) when the original proposal to add wstETH as collateral with ETH E-Mode was proposed. 

Since the original [Add wstETH to Aave Optimism v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-wsteth-to-aave-v3-on-optimism/10932/7) proposal, the wstETH/USD and wstETH/ETH oracles have been published. The later is most applicable to the ETH E-Mode category. There is sufficient permutations of oracles to facilitate using either [BGD and/or Gauntlet + Chainlink](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-and-bgd-chainlink-synchronicity-price-adapter-2-0/13046) price synchronised adapters. The most optimal oracle solution will be used at time of deployment with input from risk providers and @bgdlabs.

This proposal provides accommodation at the AAA 4 Diamond Hotel ‘Wyndham Grand Clearwater Beach’.

Providing an extravaganza stay (for up to 300 $APE holders on a first-come first-served basis) by the scenic gulf shore. With crystal clear blue water and white sand beaches, this could be an annual gathering space for ApeCoin DAO members to party. This proposal gives up to 300 community members a place to stay in the AAA 4 Diamond hotel “Wyndham Grand Clearwater Beach” for hosting Apecoin and Bored Apes parties, just in case someone is seasick of the Yacht Club parties.

Ownership of ApeCoin will be verified through a digital wallet check at registration, minimum ApeCoin requirements are as follows:
* 1 $APE = entry to conference and party.
* 1000 $APE staked = 1 hotel room based on a first come first basis.
* 2 Presidential suites will be giveaways for two lucky ApeCoin holders during the event.

### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Ape Hospitality Group aims to host a DAO only conference with $ape holders and partner communities under one roof focused on the DAO brand apart from Yuga Labs. There’s a huge misconception that still exist, many people hesitate to get involve with the DAO because they still think its just for BAYC holders. Such conferences without a high barrier of entry will create a more welcoming and IRL impact for all $ape holders.

Through this, people can interact with each other directly as well as various working groups, create bonds and get a wider idea of what we as Apecoin DAO are doing. Everyone (pending capacity) who holds $APE gets to experience the club parties at the hotel. We’ve seen a major fomo among every community outside Bored Apes during Apefest, even with the recent announcement. With this proposal, Ape Hospitality Group aims to make a place for all $ape holders to meet, party and hang out with fellow DAO members. This will help the DAO grow the unique number of holders, and give a sense of belongingness.

The main attraction will be Apecoin DAO panels with different Working Groups (who may opt in to participate), pop-up stalls for MBA licensees and booths.This will be an exclusive DAO conference for community members and builders to get together and interact with each other. Share alphas, create memories and build.

Key Benefits Summary
* Conference and get together for $Ape holders
* Panel discussion
* Networking with a wider $ape ecosystem
* Pop up stalls and booth for MBA products
* Party!


### OVERALL COST 
The total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $300,000 USD to be paid in $APE.

Breakdown:
* Booking: $184,000 (Rooms: $109,000 & Conference Hall: $75,000)
* Media and Entertainment: $50,000
    * Photography/Videography
    * Music/DJ
    * Lights
    * Merchandise
    * Catering
* Operations: $66,000
    * Administration
    * Marketing
    * Contingency
    * Insurance
* Additional costs are included in each implementation step as detailed above.

The AIP covers a 1-night stay for 300 $APE holders, first come first served. The author will check proof of holding $APE for interested people within the DAO.

312,"### Summary

The [Balancer Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth) currently safe-guards the posting of proposals with a 200k veBAL minimum delegation threshold as per the erc20-balance-of strategy for veBAL. The Balancer Maxis are usually assisting partners and are posting snapshot proposals. With this proposal we seek to give a set of trusted core contributors the author role removing the 200k veBAL threshold so they can always post to snapshot. Other than this setting, nothing else changes and the same delegation rules apply. 
Note that the author role only allows to post and edit self-made proposals.

### Motivation

As per [[BIP-163]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-163-restructure-governance-process-disband-governance-council/4244) the DAO restructured the governance process and introduced a 200,000 veBAL in delegation threshold to be able to post to snapshot. Several entities, including some delegates hold said power to post votes to snapshot (https://dune.com/balancer/vebal). However, most frequently, core contributors such as the Balancer Maxis SP are assisting partners in navigating governance by posting votes and making sure their technical specifications meet the DAOs minimal requirements.

Therefore, I propose to add a set of trusted core contributors theough the author role in the balancer.eth snapshot space, removing a minimum veBAL delegation threshold for those individuals. These are the following:

|Contributor name|Address|Role|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Xeonus|0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516|Author|
|Zen Dragon|0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17|Author|
|Zekraken|0xff0281256B2A478905B79895c1A2038A679E1751|Author|

Some of the addresses can be verified [here](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/main/extras/signers.json).

An example vote with an author role enabled in our testing snapshot space can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/balancerquadraticvoting.eth/proposal/0x83d94df2ad3f98327d719fb663e33a1e3257fd67b6c6c7c84d59d9a03f886d7e)

### Risks

The above mentioned contributors have proven themselves as trustworthy individuals with a track-record of serving the DAO for more than 2.5 years. The main risk associated with granting the author role on snapshot is posting of a proposal that is not fit for vote, although that can already happen with the veBAL threshold of 200k in place. Our trusted voters and delegates are a safeguard against any malicious potential attempts that could be performed by said individuals, although the risk for such actions is extremely low. Note that the Author role can only post snapshot votes and doesn’t have any other privileges set, further reducing overall risk of potential malicious activity with the granted role.

### Technical Specification

The Balancer DAO multi-sig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will grant the Author role to following addresses

* 0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516
* 0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17
* 0xff0281256B2A478905B79895c1A2038A679E1751

This will be done by interacting with the snapshot app over the DAO multisig, which will go to the members section of the [snapshot settings](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/settings) page and complete the following actions:

* Remove the current admin (0x6cd1), it is unclear where this address came from and is not listed in governance. The DAO multisig is the owner of the balancer.eth NFT and therefore maintains rights to manage snapshot. All recent changes to snapshot have been made by this address.
* Add the following 3 addresses author:

313,"I propose we add a Zapper function for the liquity pools so liquidity providers can add or remove liquidity in any pool while using 1 type of coin. 


Right now if an investor wants to add liquidity to the CAKE-BNB pool, they would need to hold both CAKE and BNB in their wallet. And when they remove liquidity they will get paid out CAKE and BNB tokens. 

If we add a zapper function the investor would only need to hold 1 type of coin in there wallet and could use this coin to add liquidity to any pool pancake offers. 

We could also add the zapper function for withdrawing tokens and the CAKE rewards from the liquidity pool.


If we add this function then adding liquidity would be simpler for investors as it reduces the amount of operations needed to add / remove liquidity and makes it easier to work out the gains / losses from each investment. 


For example, 
If i held BUSD and i wanted to invest in the CAKE-BNB pool, i would need to convert BUSD to CAKE and BNB (2 transactions), add liquidity (1 transaction) .. wait a few months  then withdraw (1 transaction) and convert the CAKE and BNB back to BUSD (2 transactions). for a total of 6 onchain transactions and more time / effot needed to make the investment.  


With a Zapper function I could use BUSD to add liquidity to the CAKE-BNB pool and then a few months later i could withdraw my investment in the form of BUSD. This would only take 2 transactions and would make investing more simple. 


The zapper fee. 
We could add a fee for using the Zapper function and use the funds generated to help burn more CAKE. 
I think a fee of 0.05% would be a fair amount to charge for this service.",neutral

317,"# CAKE EMISSION REDUCTION
It’s time for our monthly vote to reduce CAKE emissions! 
The end goal of reducing emissions is to become **emission neutral**: that means more CAKE leaving circulation than the amount of CAKE that's produced.

# Why become emission neutral??
CAKE hodlers should understand the potential effect that reducing the amount of CAKE in circulation may have on the token’s price. Supply vs. demand. Although reducing farm rewards may lower farms’ APR a little at first, in the long term, the goal is to keep supply low to keep demand high.


![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GaI0vObXn8VGYxTCYrsGwA.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GaI0vObXn8VGYxTCYrsGwA.png)


CAKE is currently burned in the following ways:
- 0.05% of every trade made on PancakeSwap V2
- 100% of CAKE sent to the Dev address
- 100% of CAKE raised in IFOs
- 100% of CAKE spent on Profile Creation and NFT minting
- 🆕 100% of CAKE bid by farm auction winners
- 20% of CAKE spent on lottery tickets
- 45,000 CAKE per day (historically assigned to the lottery)
- 3% of every Prediction round is used to buy CAKE for burning
- 2% of every yield harvest in the Auto CAKE Pool
And we’ve got more burning mechanisms in store for the future.

### **Here are this month’s proposals:**

You can vote for any one of these five options!

# ❌ No change:
- 9 CAKE per block go to yield farms
- Total emissions = 19 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pool)


# 🔥 1 CAKE per block (11%) reduction to farm rewards:
- 8 CAKE per block go to yield farms
- New total emissions = 18 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pool)


# 🔥🔥 2 CAKE per block (22%) reduction to farm rewards:
- 7 CAKE per block go to yield farms
- New total emissions = 17 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pool)


# 🔥🔥🔥 3 CAKE per block (33%) reduction to farm rewards:
- 6 CAKE per block go to yield farms
- New total emissions = 16 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pool)


# 🔥🔥🔥🔥 4 CAKE per block (44%) reduction to farm rewards:
- 5 CAKE per block go to yield farms
- New total emissions = 15 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pool)

## ⚠️Please note⚠️

**One option must have a majority of 50%+** at the end snapshot in order to win the vote and be executed.

If none of the options get over 50% of the vote, we will create a new proposal.

A 44% reduction to farms may impact APRs a lot initially, but we’ll propose further farm reward adjustments later, which will help balance things out and sustain the most high-value farms.",neutral

**Summary:**
> Gains Network (gTrade) is a decentralized perpetual futures trading platform on Arbitrum. Gains Network aims to list gUSDC, a token that benefits from protocol fees, on Balancer to establish significant liquidity and integrations within the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem.


**References/Useful links:**

> Link to:
    • Website: https://gains.trade/ 
    • Documentation: https://gains-network.gitbook.io/docs-home 
    • Github Page: https://github.com/GainsNetwork-org    
    • Other useful links: https://dune.com/gains/gtrade_stats 

**Protocol Description:**

>Gains Network [(gTrade)](https://gains.trade/trading#BTC-USD) is a decentralized perpetual futures trading platform with a robust infrastructure featuring 181 trading pairs with high leverage [up to 150x for crypto, 250x for commodities, and 1000x on forex], deep liquidity, guaranteed order execution, and accurate pricing. Since inception, the protocol has generated $73B lifetime volume.
The asset Gains Network would like to list on Balancer is gUSDC. gUSDC is one of the gVault tokens that receives a share of the protocol fees by serving as a counterparty to trader wins & losses.
The history price of gUSDC can be publicly viewed on our dune dashboard linked above. It has generally been an “up-only” asset with the exception of a few dips shortly after the launch of the asset back in January.
The historical price of gUSDC can be found here: https://dune.com/queries/3385617/5681244

**Motivation:**

> Gains Network aims to enable a gauge for a gUSDC / USDC pool to significantly increase the liquidity for gUSDC on secondary markets to set the foundation for more integrations with the purpose of expanding its utility across Arbitrum DeFi.

**Specifications:**
 
>Gains Network will utilize a part of its STIP.B LP incentives budget to bootstrap more (sticky) liquidity for the [gUSDC](https://gains.trade/vaults/gUSDC) vault as it anticipates more USDC-collateral usage on gTrade over the coming months. Initially, the focus will be on building liquidity on partner DEXs for gUSDC/USDC pools, including this Balancer pool. This strategy aims to unlock various partnership opportunities, creating an ecosystem around gUSDC through lending markets, LP-strategy protocols, and more.
Gains Network is seeking to co-incentivize this pool with Balancer to establish the required liquidity as a foundation for said gUSDC integrations and consecutively form a long-term partnership with Balancer as one of the main venues for gUSDC since Gains Network believes Balancer is a pool that can largely be maintained beyond incentives through swapping fees post the bootstrapping phase.

1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    

>The incentives distributor is governed by the following Multisig address: [0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D
](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D)And, Gains Network is actively working towards being a DAO governed through the $GNS token.

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

> gTrade leverages their own custom-built Chainlink decentralized oracle network (DON) to provide real-time, aggregated prices for their leveraged trading products. Their oracle architecture uses a custom DON to supply on-demand prices to an aggregator contract while the official Chainlink Price Feeds serve as anchors, meaning if their price differs by more than 1.5% from Chainlink Price Feeds, a circuit breaker is triggered.

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

> Audits are conducted with each upgrade Gains Network undergoes. With the release of [V8 in May](https://medium.com/gains-network/introducing-gtrade-v8-diamond-refactor-and-smart-contract-integration-a175b96ccb82), the entire codebase has been audited. Moreover, the release of [V9](https://x.com/GainsNetwork_io/status/1807877092836610406) [current version] has been audited as well.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

> We will state our centralization vectors by giving insights into our most centralized facet: the DON. The current custom decentralized oracle network is operated by 8 independent chainlink node operators & 1 price feed from StorkOracle.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

>There’s no information available on the Balancer pool yet as it’s yet to be launched. 
However, the gUSDC asset is tradeable on a Ramses CL pool as per June 15th and started to get incentivized with $ARB from June 27th onwards. The pool is currently sitting at $2M TVL and can be found here: https://ramses.exchange/liquidity/v2/0xe9e3ef12f1f9dbaf7b7f57ab262c54117448884b 
Since the inception of this secondary market pool, Gains Network vaults have been consistently overcollateralized while the gUSDC asset has never been below peg and has not experienced significant volatility. Considering the ‘up-only’ nature of gTokens and gUSDC currently sitting at a 124.1% collateralization ratio, the price of gUSDC is expected to continue its upwards price action as time passes. 

 
6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) 

>The pool will not serve as the primary source of liquidity in the bootstrapping phase, but will be leveraged as the primary source of liquidity once the bootstrapping phase has passed. 
The pool can generate consistent fees due to gUSDC depositors only being able to use Balancer as a means of exiting before our epoch system, looping through lending markets & liquidations through lending markets.

319,"**Summary** :

sUSD is a decentralized stable coin over collateralized by the SNX token. sUSD is already listed on AAVE markets as a lendable asset as well as SNX which can be used as collateral in addition to borrow/lending. There is significant liquidity for sUSD on both Mainnet and Optimism. I am proposing for it to be enabled as collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism with a 10 million sUSD supply cap.

**Risk Parameters**
- set sUSD max LTV to 60%
- set liquidation threshold to 75%
- set liquidation penalty to 5%
- upgrade the interest rate curve to that of DAI/TUSD
- Fixed lending is not enabled.

**Motivation**

sUSD market cap has grown tremendously over the past year, and the steady demand for decentralized stable coins has contributed to its growth. sUSD is highly over collateralized by SNX, the governance token, and backstop for the Synthetix protocol.

The rise in its liquidity on major dexes has contributed to sUSD stability over the past year, and allowing collateral use would promote its liquidity in aave markets.

**Rationale**

SNX stakers are incentivized to actively manage their debt relative to their SNX stake and sometimes cause spikes in demand for sUSD on markets including AAVE (especially when there are other Yield generating opportunities with sUSD), this may cause small deviations from the peg but with low volatility.

From a counter-party risk perspective, all underlying functions in relation to sUSD are fundamentally the same as that of SNX.

The SNX and sUSD contracts are fully upgradeable. Still, all changes must go through a formal governance process from SIP to deployment, which would be announced well before the upgrades are made and thus does not present a substantial counter-party risk.

The sUSDv2CRV pool has deep liquidity on L1, and with incentivizes, the L2 pool will soon have deep liquidity. 

In addition to sUSD, there are other synth pools on Curve with emission gauges to supplement sUSD liquidity (sBTC, sETH ). All synths are redeemable at their dollar value in sUSD at the ChainLink quoted price through the Synthetix protocol or Curve (via cross-asset swaps); thus they help facilitate the arbitrage sUSD peg deviations.

### Motivation

Since the Maxi Q2 funding proposal gas prices on Ethereum have significantly increased. The course of our regular on-chain operations now easily consume more than half an ETH on a weekly basis. We've tried to cut some costs by offloading as much ethereum pool creation as possible onto third parties - zekraken even spun up this [simple UI](https://pool-creator.web.app/) to make that easier so balpy isn't required. That said, most things we do simply have to be done by us.

As this is becoming a more significant cost it's important to bring transparency to how this is being spent. We will commit to exploring a framework for reporting how gas is spent to the community - a dune dashboard is probably the ideal solution. If for some reason this is not possible some alternative will be presented in follow on funding requests. 

For now we request 10 WETH from the treasury which we hope will last until the end of Q2. 

### Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will transfer 10 WETH to the Maxi Operations safe `eth:0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`",neutral

Title: [ARFC-Addendum] Update Merit for Round 4
Date: 2024-05-09
Author: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)
---

### Simple Summary

We propose updating Merit parameters and rewarded actions to increase program efficiency, as well as evolving the wETH part of the merit program with a new program called “Ahab”.

###  Motivation

Merit’s first quarter and three initial rounds have been a clear success. Morpho Optimizers are now a dead product with zombie remaining TVL, and GHO grew to $54M despite unfavorable market conditions. The Aave protocol maintained and developed its market share in DeFi in a highly competitive landscape thanks to the Merit program. While “Merit is Forever” has been approved by governance, we aim to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program.

### Specification

#### Boosters Update

Removal of “Second-degree user of aligned protocol”: due to lack of demand from second-degree protocols and investment in positioning Aave at the front row, this booster is no longer justified. We will reconsider reintroduction if some protocols show signs of Aave-alignment.
Introducing weETH in the “Diversity supporter” boost: weETH is the fastest-growing reserve in Aave V3 Ethereum, and this boost was designed to favor alternatives to main LST. It might be worth introducing a LRT to this boost.
Removal of OG DAO participant: this boost was designed to reward early participants in the Aave DAO, but it seems unfair for new users to keep having this boost after more than a quarter. We propose doubling the “Active in governance” boost to favor users supporting the DAO voting activity.

#### Diluters Update

StkGHO Cooldown users: we consider users declaring their intent to leave the safety module should not receive Merit rewards. A full dilution is seen as punitive and not in line with Aave’s ethos, so we propose stopping the points meter when these users call the cooldown method, allowing them to accumulate points until the cooldown activation.
Morpho Users: The Morpho protocol continues to show direct hostility towards the Aave ecosystem onchain & offchain. We propose including all present and future Morpho products.

#### Merit wETH Program

The merit wETH program has both been a total success and below expectations. This program has factually been the opportunity for >250k ETH to leave other protocols to join Aave, but these results are almost exclusively due to direct coordinated BD actions from Aave Finance & ACI with a small subset of “whale” users.

We consider it an inefficient allocation of resources to continue the program as it is. To upgrade this program, we propose focusing on the most efficient aspect and focusing on the BD “whale hunter” efforts. We propose rebranding this new part of the program as the “Ahab” program, which is expected to be significantly more budget-efficient than the current program.

### Next Steps

1. Gather community consensus on this proposed path.
2. If there is agreement, escalate this ARFC-Addendum proposal to a snapshot vote for formal approval.

### Disclamer

The Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes “Merit” without external compensation.

325,"## Summary   
  

Aave Companies is proposing to the DAO the introduction of GHO, which was outlined in this initial proposal. 

 
With community approval, GHO can be launched on the Aave Protocol, allowing users to mint GHO against their supplied collaterals.   
  
GHO can be minted by users against a diversified set of crypto-assets. Borrowers of GHO will continue earning interest on the underlying supplied collateral, just as in all other borrow transactions on the Aave Protocol.   
  

If approved, the introduction of GHO will provide benefits for the community via the AaveDAO by sending 100% of interest payments on GHO borrows to the DAO.  
  

If approved and implemented through an AIP, GHO will be administered by Aave governance.  
 
It will be up to the AaveDAO to decide whether they are willing to support Aave Companies for the costs and work associated with GHO. 
 
## Community Feedback 
 
The community was very engaged with the GHO proposal, providing incredibly helpful and informative feedback. 
 

Some of the most notable feedback includes (but is not limited to): 
 

- Attention to potential pitfalls around DAO-set interest rates. 

- The importance of supply caps. 

- The value that a peg stability module could bring. 

- The necessity for properly vetting potential facilitators. 

 

This snapshot, if approved, will assign the Ethereum V2 Market on the Aave Protocol as the first facilitator for GHO, whilst also greenlighting the GHO proposal more generally, allowing for audits to take place in the context of broad community approval. It will be followed by a separate proposal that outlines a proposed strong starting state for GHO, which incorporates and builds upon the aforementioned feedback while helping to ensure that GHO is community driven from the get-gho. 

  

## Snapshot  
  

This preliminary Snapshot vote serves to:  
  
- Receive community approval for the pursuit of the GHO project.  

- Whitelist the Aave V2 Ethereum Market as the first facilitator for GHO. 
- Signal community approval to kick off discussions around starting parameters. 

 

Our proposal for this starting state will be informed by community feedback regarding the initial proposal and will aim to provide a strong initiation point for the AaveDAO to oversee GHOs development and parameters moving forward.",bullish

328,"# Summary

This is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s sETH2 on AAVE.

# Motivation

Staking is foundational to the Ethereum network, with liquid staking specifically providing users with the opportunity to unlock the power of their staked capital. One of the most requested features within our protocol is the ability to utilise sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.

sETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH specifically, given the high correlation between asset prices. Following the launch of eMode within Aave V3, sETH2 would allow for leveraged ETH staking without taking on a lot of risk. Lido’s stETH has proven to be a valuable collateral asset within the Aave ecosystem and it’s time to explore adding sETH2, the second most liquid ETH staking token. This integration would benefit both StakeWise and Aave, bringing new users to both platforms.

StakeWise is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry, such as requiring 32 ETH and the expertise needed for maintaining staking infrastructure, allowing anyone to benefit from the rewards of the Beacon Chain.

ETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenised into sETH2, representing users’ interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2 (note this application will focus solely on sETH2).

As a liquid staking platform, users are free to un-stake at any time by trading their sETH2 back into ETH utilising the protocol’s deep liquidity pools.

Dmitri Tsumak first announced StakeWise was under development in April 2020. StakeWise launched on mainnet in March 2021, following a 9-month beta phase. StakeWise was the first staking pool to move to non-custodial staking in April 2021 and has since grown to over 70k ETH staked, helping DAOs, whales and individuals alike. In January 2022, the StakeWise Metro upgrade was announced, commencing the decentralisation of the protocol. Further information on Metro can be found [here](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8).

StakeWise has been audited by [Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits).

->*sETH2 Overview*

sETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenised staking deposit into StakeWise’s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1-to-1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts as an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH (not re-pricing or rebalancing), providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2.

sETH2 supply sits at [59,266](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a) (~$200M), held by ~3k individual users. The main liquidity pool for sETH2 is on UniSwap ([here](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)). This pool has ~$160M TVL, consisting of ~26k ETH and ~30k sETH2. StakeWise is in the process of launching a second liquidity pool on Curve, with further details provided below.

**Explain the positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**

sETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH, given the high correlation and the proven peg stability of sETH2 (detailed further below). This makes sETH2 a prime candidate for Aave’s new eMode to enable leveraged staking.

sETH2 collateral would also allow holders to take speculative positions, such as shorting an asset or taking a leveraged long position on ETH, for example.

sETH2 has deep liquidity with ~$160M TVL, soon to be spread across multiple pools.

**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**

StakeWise’s background is detailed above.

StakeWise DAO is live and manages the protocol. Whether it is changing the protocol fees, adding node operators to the network or making amendments to smart contracts, all changes require DAO approval. The StakeWise DAO is [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.

Investors in the StakeWise DAO consist of Blockdaemon, boldstart Ventures, Greenfield One, Collider Ventures, Lionschain Capital and gumi Cryptos.

The StakeWise product suite consists of liquid staking on both Ethereum and Gnosis chain, branching out into other PoS networks over time.

**How is the asset currently used?**

First and foremost, sETH2 provides holders, from individual retail stakers to DAOs, the rights to staking rewards from the Beacon Chain.

Creating utility for sETH2 is of the highest priority. Currently, sETH2 can be used to provide liquidity on AMMs, such as UniSwap and Curve. Multiple other integrations are lined up involving sETH2, such as using sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.

**Emission schedule**

There is no emission schedule. sETH2 is minted only when ETH is deposited into the StakeWise staking pool.

**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**

-> *Multi-sigs*

StakeWise has run non-custodial ETH staking since April 2021. Prior to April 2021, a multi-sig was used, named the Horcrux, with ~18k ETH of the StakeWise pool currently controlled by the Horcrux. More info can be found [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/stakewise-pool#the-horcrux).

The DAO treasury is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x144a98cb1CdBb23610501fE6108858D9B7D24934) with a DAO committee of 7 persons. The goal of the DAO committee is to monitor transactions voted upon via Snapshot and reject malicious transactions that would harm the protocol. In order to reject a transaction, a threshold of 4 out of 7 committee members must sign the rejection.

-> *Upgradable Contracts:* Yes (DAO approval only)

A successful Snapshot vote is required to make any changes to StakeWise smart contracts. The DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) and all voting rights fall to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.

**Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**

Market Cap ~$167M

Volatility -

sETH2 has proven peg stability. Superimposing stETH / ETH with sETH2 / ETH highlights this stability when compared against stETH which is already whitelisted for Aave.

![|624x205](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iV-tgDKkGvUmpr9MP6D9-qWNApCsLGrTiBqlIGL3K4IfXl2MB--glv35OerGGzZteAOZaAtbKVkCsGhGUuzgxD4JWBDpv76zk0QkfRaEMpIGAuuOuo1Ot6Ey8GF6qRC6c3JHTA60)

Note that StakeWise will soon be adjusting the main UniSwap pool by reducing the fee tier from 0.3% to 0.01%, which is expected to close the remaining gap between sETH2 and ETH. StakeWise is also in the process of launching a new pool on Curve which will further increase sETH2’s peg resilience.

# Risk Assessment

**![|602x79](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A1EiT5B6h4uSCMG9uVA_jYnHWf9ANliGl5jvj2cBiTxHd3hmc1fkpX8Lh3GD8LDvK6CQFF78lG99LXcqEPh1T03isgjiF1NdEYPlkn4hBMQ5Oh9cfaLlpvzNj4LJ_mrLtUoKAHDB8O6oHeqwBQ)**

# Security Considerations

-> *Counterparty risks*

StakeWise relies on an Oracle network to accurately report daily staking rewards to the rETH2 smart contract in order to mint and distribute the correct amount of rETH2. Currently, there are 5 oracles live with details provided [here](https://launchpad.eatsteakbewise.com/oraclestatus-mainnet.html). Note that the number of oracles on the network will be increasing from 5 to 10 over the coming months.

4 out of the 5 oracles are required to submit the same rewards data for the total supply of rETH2 is updated. Further information is found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/oracle/blob/master/README.md).

As previously detailed, the protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO. Extra security features are in place to stop malicious transactions from passing through the DAO. For example, each successful on-chain proposal must undergo two days of escalation game, before entering one day of the multi-sig backstop period.

-> *Staking risks*

sETH2 holders are exposed to risks associated with staking, such as slashing events and downtime penalties. The StakeWise DAO has taken steps to mitigate these risks:

* Prospective node operators are vetted by the validator committee, required to enter a testnet and must pass situational stress testing. Only then will the StakeWise DAO vote for whether an operator can join the network. StakeWise only on-boards leading node operators to ensure the highest security and yield for its users.
* StakeWise provides node operators with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, such as the ability to quickly transition between staking clients on demand.
* There is no staking insurance currently in place, however we are working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance as a high priority (expected to be in place by early May).

Note that hostage risks are common in liquid staking pools, however this does not apply to StakeWise. The StakeWise DAO controls the exit signatures for its operators, allowing the DAO to force exit validators from the network should the situation arise. This makes it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage and will ensure that all future staking rewards, such as MEV and tips, flow to the pool.

StakeWise has experienced no slashing or downtime penalties to date.

-> *Smart Contract Risks*

Stakers are exposed to smart contract risk. To mitigate this, the protocol has undergone audits by 3 separate auditors: Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)). Our code is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts).

Despite having no security concerns to date, StakeWise is committed to reducing the risk for its users and is in the process of adding a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI.

-> *Price Oracles*

sETH2 currently relies on a UniSwap TWAP oracle. With the addition of new liquidity pools, we will be upgrading our oracle to a Chainlink oracle over the coming months.

# Proposed Risk Parameters

* LTV: 70% (vs 82.5% for ETH)
* Liquidation Threshold: 75% (vs 85% for ETH)
* Liquidation Bonus: 7.5% (vs 5% for ETH)
* Reserve Factor: 10% (vs 10% for ETH)

The proposed sETH2 risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH. ETH and sETH2 are highly correlated, and as such, have similar volatility profiles. The LTV and liquidity threshold below that of ETH account for the extra risks associated with liquidating sETH2.

333,"**Summary**

This proposal would see the addition of an [mBTC, [sBTC]] Metapool.

**Abstract**

mStable’s new mAsset, mBTC, unites various Bitcoin-pegged ERC20 tokens. The mBTC token can be minted with wBTC, RenBTC and sBTC, and you can redeem it for those three Bitcoin tokens. mAssets benefit from capped risk, with max-weights and an incoming insurance policy provided by the system token MTA. mBTC would be the second mAsset with a Metapool on Curve, with the [mUSD, [3Pool]] having been an active and relatively high yielding pool over the past few months ([https://www.curve.fi/musd](https://www.curve.fi/musd)), with multiple active derivatives on yEarn.


**Motivation**

mBTC has been launched for 3 weeks, and has been seeing consistent demand since launch which is set to continue as the system matures. There is an exponentially increasing TVL cap, which is set to expire after 7 full weeks (source: Dune [https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/mbtc](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/mbtc)).

While there is demand, there are a lack of liquid/efficient markets for mBTC. Having mBTC listed on Curve would provide mStable users with an on-ramp and provide the following for Curve users:

- Another option for yield seekers on Curve
- Increased revenue for sBTC LP holders from a meta pool with a positive growth trajectory
- Increased fee revenue for veCRV holders

**Summary**:

Back when Aura launched, a portion of the supply was allocated to the Balancer DAO.  That vested Aura exists in the following vesting contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422#code

**Motivation**:

At the time of writing, 1.4m Aura has vested with 600k Aura left unvested. We are proposing to lock this into vlAura to begin earning rewards and eventually start allocating vote weight towards revenue generating or strategically important pools that lack a proper means of bootstrapping without ecosystem stakeholders voting philanthropically.  A proposal for how the DAO will deal with allocating this vlAura voting power will be presented in the coming weeks, but we think it is prudent to initiate the locking now.

title: [ARFC] Migrate Holdings from v2 to v3 and acquire wstETH and rETH
author: @llamaxyz - @TokenLogic
created: 2023-05-13

---

# Summary

This publication proposes migrating assets from Aave v2 to v3 on Ethereum and acquiring wstETH and rETH.

# Abstract

After ensuring there is sufficient aUSDC to fund Service Providers, this publication Part 2 of 3, involves redeeming v2 aTokens and depositing the underlying assets in Aave v3.

In addition, ETH & wETH is to be used for acquiring wstETH and rETH. This is intended to boost the productivity of Aave's assets and provide potential flexibility for potential GHO liquidity positions. 

# Motivation

The following considerations have been accommodated:

* v2 aUSDT required for Signma Prime's and ACI's streaming contracts.
* v2 aUSDC required for Service Providers streaming contracts.
* wETH required for B-80BAL-20WETH (326.3 wETH).
* BAL required for B-80BAL-20WETH.
* CRV required for sdCRV.
* Exclude Assets not listed on Aave v3.
* Exclude wETH to be converted to wstETH (800 wETH).
* Exclude wETH to be converted to rETH (800 wETH).

Swapping wETH or ETH to wstETH incurs minimal slippage at the proposed size via Cowswap. However, when wETH is swapped to rETH slippage is >1% at size.

Llama will optimise for maximising Aave return. In doing so swaps and direct deposits into the respective protocol, Lido and/or Rocket Pool, will be considered.

Given the amount of time that has passed since the original proposal, Aave's ETH nominated asset holding has grown. Aave v2 generates around 30 wETH per week from the v2 deployment alone. Aave holds around 158.2 wETH in Aave v3.

This publication will deposit aroud 140.23. wETH in Aave v3, retain 326.3 wETH in Aave v2 to be used for B-80BAL-20WETH and will acquire 800 wETH/ETH worth of wstETH and rETH.

There are hundreds of NFT projects popping up, all with some volume. Why not change the structure and have a page added where it is able to sell & buy all NFT's, without getting the PCS approval first.

Proposal for the new structure:

Lets's make 1 ''free for all'' page where everything can be sold and bought. I think this will bring huge NFT volume to the PCS NFT marketplace, also contributing to the weekly cake burn. Besides this page we keep the current ''whitelisting'' structure to give projects a spotlight for their own NFT project. This can be free, or a paid option, decided bij PCS. You can even take this further and implement a ''bid'' structure like the weekly farm bid to give project some additional exposure for their NFT project. But this can be different topics to vote on.

342,"# Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider Proposal Q2 2023

## Overview

This proposal is to continue Balancer Grants within the Balancer DAO, as an independent community-owned grants program for the Balancer ecosystem as a Service Provider (SP). The program aims to accelerate the development of the BAL ecosystem while optimizing contributor rewards in the Balancer ecosystem. Grants are an alternative pathway for projects aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects up to $100k USD that don’t fit the Foundation Service Provider funding model.

The current Balancer Grants team has been working together under the previous [snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x8e20d769b9674fbea2f749844525bdddb8afcd874ab8b3aafb17c91a46cf7bca) passed on Jan 9, 2023. To date, the grants program has successfully delivered 7 waves of funding and mentoring, expanding the Balancer ecosystem by encouraging building to increase TVL and bring more quality teams into the Balancer ecosystem. This proposal is to continue the operation of the grants program as per [BIP-76](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-144-fund-balancer-grants-q1-2023/4203/7) and [BIP-144](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-144-fund-balancer-grants-q1-2023/4203).

Only significant changes to the previous proposal are:

1. Co-lead positions changing to Burns as a single lead due to Zen Dragon’s external commitments. Zen Dragon’s contributions as a co-lead have been invaluable to the grants program’s success to date. Fortunately, he will be remaining on the grants team as a highly valuable committee member.
2. Addition of Steve0xp in place of ZeKraken. ZeKraken stepped down in Q1 with other commitments and Steve0xp has shown immediate commitment and value to the grants committee over the previous 2 months through knowledge as a smart contract dev and creation/publication of marketing materials. As a long standing committee member with vast Balancer and DeFi knowledge generally, ZeKraken will be a welcome contributor in the future if circumstances change.

Due to rise in BAL price since previous funding proposal, no funds are requested to top up the treasury (currently 65,469 BAL uncommitted) for 55,719 BAL to future grantees and 9,750 BAL for committee/support.

As always, we welcome comments and recommendations from the community on how to better develop the Balancer grants program.

## Previous Performance

Managing between 16-18 live grantees providing cross-functional support between BLabs, Orb and grantees.
Championed co-funding arrangements with Aura Grants (Notional and Sturdy)
Two TWAMM implementations, one in Beta (longswap.xyz) and a second due to be live next quarter
Notional Finance adding >$3m TVL from $70k grant. More pools to be launched with Aura co-funding

Funding custom managed pools controller development with novel use cases. (Kassandra, Autonolas)

Bringing Yearn’s yBAL into Balancer ecosystem
Funding development of Xeonus’ analytics site
Expanding Balancer docs and SDK
Dedication to transparent approvals process and reporting
Recovered Funds from stale grantees to redistribute to new projects.

## Domain of Operation

The grant program provides support and funding (up to $100K USD, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem. While the Foundation SP model is aimed at long term engagements or those with a cost beyond $100k USD, grants are an alternative pathway aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects.

The Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee are below

## Grants Committee

The Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds. One major change is moving from co-leads to a single lead due to external commitments. With this change, the committee remains an equal democracy. While we rely on individuals expertise in different areas to help make informed decisions, no individual has a greater authority on what is approved or not.

Burns - Committee Coordination Lead

Zen Dragon - Committee Member/Mentor

Jay Napier - Committee Member/Mentor

John Grant - Committee Member/Mentor

Mike B - Committee Member/Mentor

Steve0xp - Committee Member/Mentor

Xeonus - Committee Member/Mentor

The committee has the ability to onboard/offboard members as individual circumstances change throughout the quarter between funding proposals. Given the authority to approve and distribute grant funding, the committee can also self manage members within the approved budget.

The Grants Committee will continue to work closely with Balancer Labs, Orb Collective and Ballers to amplify and support grantees.

By having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi.

## Length of Engagement and Budget breakdown

This budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants DAO for the period January 1st, 2023 until March 31st, 2023. At the end of this cycle (March 31st), any unallocated resources will be sent back to the Balancer Treasury or kept to offset the next quarter budget request. A new proposal for the next cycle will be submitted at the end of this cycle.

Compensation will continue to be paid out in BAL to assist the DAO in becoming sustainable from protocol fees. Due to the inconsistent nature of grants and the associated workload, grants team members will self-assess their level of contribution against defined Tiers each month to determine their compensation which is reviewed by the grants co-leads and committee.

Tiers are:

Committee Lead - $7,500 USD paid in BAL - significant administration of grants docs, prepare and present monthly reports/community calls, wave round up, grantee announcements, budget preparation and SP proposals, .

High Level Contributor - $3,500 USD paid in BAL - as per Low Contributor plus mentor 5+ low assistance grantees or 3+ high assistance grantees.

Medium Level Contributor - $2,500 USD paid in BAL - as per Low Contributor plus mentor 2-4 low assistance grantees or 1-2 high assistance grantees.

Low Level Contributor - $1,250 USD paid in BAL - contribute to weekly grants meeting, follow up call for 1-2 grant applications, mentor at least 1 grantee with low level assistance required (generally self-sufficient grantee with no major coordination with BLabs).

|Total request for quarter|0 BAL||

## Service Provider Pledge

The Grant DAO service provider agrees to operate under the existing Balancer DAO’s Code of Conduct, as listed [here](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88)

The Grant DAO service also pledges to be held accountable by the Balancer Token Holder in accordance with the Balancer DAO [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1). This will include the Grant’s Committee:

* Holding an open community call quarterly and keeping a recording available for 3 months
* Developing a monthly report detailing key objective progress which is posted to the Balancer Forum
* Attending and presenting during the Baller weekly meeting (mandatory attendance by a least 1 representative)

## Specification

There is no on-chain action required. If approved, the Grants Committee multi-sig (currently 3 out of 7) will continue to operate with the remaining funds in the Grants treasury (0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597) carried over and approved to be delegated to the grantees.

All transactions will be recorded in a Sheet maintained by the committee and on chain.

## Title : [ARFC] wGHO Aave V3 Onboarding

## Author : Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs

## Date: 2023-09-15
---
## Summary

This proposal aims to onboard wGHO, an ERC-20 token wrapper of GHO, as a collateral-only asset in a newly created stablecoin emode within the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.

## Motivation

The onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.

This integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.

Alongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.

It's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.

wGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. 

## Specification

The ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:

- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset & isolation mode asset.
- wGHO parameters:

| LTV | 77% |
| --- | --- |
| LT | 80%  |
| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |
| Supply Cap | 1M |
| Borrow Cap | 0 |
| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |

### Note:

wGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.

Onboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.

## Disclaimer

The Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The he author have both large GHO debt & GHO holdings. The ACI uses GHO to fund the [Orbit program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241).

## Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback and consensus on this ARFC.
2. Escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot Stage.
3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE approved, escalate to AIP stage.

title: [ARFC] Add fUSDC to Ethereum v3
author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative
created: 2023-05-23
---

## Summary

This ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add fUSDC to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Abstract

fUSDC is a yield-bearing token representing USDC deposits in Flux, a fork of Compound V2. Adding fUSDC to Ethereum v3 would allow fUSDC holders to borrow stablecoins on Aave and leverage their fUSDC position, boosting the stablecoin utilization rate on Aave, while attracting new stablecoin deposits thanks to boosted supply rates.

## Motivation

fUSDC is a new financial primitive with arguably the best risk-adjusted yield available in DeFi. Adding support for fUSDC on Ethereum V3 in isolated mode would allow fUSDC holders to borrow stablecoins on Aave and leverage their fUSDC position, boosting the stablecoin utilization rate on Aave, while attracting new stablecoin deposits thanks to boosted supply rates.

## Specification

Ticker: fUSDC

Contract Address: `[0x465a5a630482f3abd6d3b84b39b29b07214d19e5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x465a5a630482f3abd6d3b84b39b29b07214d19e5)`

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Isolation Mode | Yes |
| Borrowable | No |
| Collateral Enabled | Yes |
| Supply Cap | 220M (~$4.45M) |
| Borrow Cap | N/A |
| Debt Ceiling | $1M |
| LTV | 77% |
| LT | 79% |
| Liquidation Bonus | 4.5% |
| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 20% |

352,"Summary

It has been approximately one year since the last revision to Venus Tokenomics and given the continuing evolution of the market, it’s time to reevaluate an optimal distribution of income given the protocol’s current and future needs.

This proposal seeks to address the unequal distribution of income between rewards and treasury reserves. It lays out a comprehensive plan to optimize the income distribution, in order to better cater to the protocol’s needs and safeguard its sustainability.

The key highlights of the proposed changes are as follows:

Redistribute protocol reserve revenue allocation to:
40% Risk Fund
40% Treasury Reserve
10% XVS Vault Rewards (Buyback)
10% Venus Prime Token Program

Redistribute liquidation and other product development distribution to:
50% Risk Fund
40% Treasury Reserves
10% XVS Vault Rewards (Buyback)

Make use of the savings from the two rounds of 50% XVS emissions reduction to double the XVS vault legacy rewards currently set at 525 XVS/Day to 1050 XVS/Day, with the aim of maintaining or even enhancing the vault rewards.

Adjust the Venus Prime program (Soulbound Token) rewards. Initial rewards for this program have been 20% of accumulated product revenues since Q4, 2022. These rewards currently exceed $750K, which are expected to significantly increase the APYs for eligible participants. 

We propose to reduce the program’s revenue allocation to 10% to balance rewards while preserving attractive APYs and incentivizing user participation.

The expected outcomes are an increase in treasury reserves, sustainable reward emission rates, sustainable Venus Prime (SBT) reward incentives, and maintenance of an attractive APR to reward XVS Vault stakers.

Methodology of Analysis

To bring forth these recommendations, the proposal has assessed the existing tokenomics of the Venus Protocol, considered the past changes and their impact on the ecosystem, and analyzed the market dynamics and trends.

This change is possible if we consider the savings from the protocol’s October and February 50% XVS emission reduction, which accounted for an estimated amount of more than $2.7M. With this, we propose re-allocating these savings towards XVS vault stakers, enhancing rewards without compromising on the token emission rate.

Results and Conclusions

The proposed revisions in Venus Protocol Tokenomics are expected to yield positive results for the Venus ecosystem, ensuring a fairer distribution of income and enhancing the platform’s sustainability.

*Cake IFO pool ticket - Increase unlimited  Sale to 75% - Every 10 cake staked for at least 2 weeks before the IFO, gives you 1 IFO ticket and each ticket grants you a 100 busd (not cake to remove the need to unstake) allocation.

**Protocol Description:**

See here: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708

Centered around [@BalancerLabs](https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs)’s veBAL, Aura coordinates incentives around vote-escrowed tokens to boost yield potential and governance power of DeFi liquidity providers, governance token stakers and voters.

**Motivation:**

The synergies between Balancer and Aura are widely known. The approval of this gauge for the 80/20 AURA/ETH pool will set Aura up for a successful launch period and continue to provide deep liquidity for AURA in the years to come.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

No

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

https://docs.aura.finance/aura/security#audits

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

Aura is a non custodial, non pausable platform.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

355,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes BitTorrent ($BTT) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with BitTorrent! BitTorrent Chain is the first scalable cross-chain interoperability protocol on TRON, BSC and Ethereum. 

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $BTT tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 272,730,000,000 BTT
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on February 12th 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on April 13th 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 157,829 BTT 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the $BTT Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide an BTT-BUSD farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

#### What is $BTT?

From the team: “BitTorrent Chain (BTTC) supports smart contract extension through sidechains and is compatible with Ethereum-based smart contracts. Together with many other functions it boasts, it enables developers to migrate and develop DApps on the chain without a hitch. 

BTT can be brought onto BitTorrent Chain via BitTorrent Bridge and then be used to pay for gas fees and participate in projects as a native token. Any participant on BTTC can vote and receive voting rewards.

BTT token plays a crucial role in the following functions of BitTorrent: 

1. BTTC: Multi-chain layer 2 solution bridging BSC, ETH and TRON. 
2. BTFS: Decentralized storage protocol 
3. BitTorrent Speed: Decentralized Web 3 file sharing protocol 
4. Dlive: Decentralized live streaming”

title: [TEMP CHECK] Safety Module Upgrade Part V - veToken Holding Management Framework
author: @Llamaxyz - @dydymoon & @TokenLogic
created: 2023-04-13

---

# Summary

This directional publication presents an opportunity for the community to elect a voting committee and define a framework to manage the DAO’s strategic assets holdings.

# Abstract

This publication presents the community with the opportunity to introduce a voting framework & committee that will conduct votes on veToken and other strategic assets holdings on Aave DAO’s behalf. There are several types of votes in other communities which are high context and time sensitive that can not be automated.

Aave would benefit from optimizing these resources in the most efficient way (i.e: Avoid Curve & Balancer gauges votes weekly on the Aave snapshot and/or management by AIP), and this publication presents the community with an opportunity to establish a voting framework and electing a voting committee.

How the committee is to vote wouldl be determined by an overall global strategy that is agreed/voted upon, by Aave governance.

# Rationale:

As a reminder, veBAL positions offer the following benefits:

* Gauge-weight Power: Voting power which influences emissions on the gauges.

* Governance Power: Voting power in the DAO proposals

* veBoost: Holding veBAL earns a boost up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided.

* Protocol Fees: Part of the trading fees sold for bb-a-USD and claimable by lockers.

This proposal assumes that the veBAL position will be locked from the collector contract, and aims to define how these benefits should be managed.

## Managing strategic assets on Collector Contract

Most of the strategic assets are held on the Reserve Factor Mainnet, which is also where the treasury strategies will be deployed, so it makes sense to focus the whitelist proposals on this contract: `0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c` (which is the same for v2 and v3).

However, DAO process are changing from one project to another, which can create incompatibilities:

* Aave Governance is fully on-chain and only focused on protocols decisions, requiring most proposal to be approved by an AIP (which usually takes more than 1 week to be implemented)

* Balancer Governance is also different (up to 1 year lock), governance power is off-chain, veBoost, gauge power and protocol fees claim are on-chain.

Main benefits

* bb-a-USD & BAL claim function from veBAL rewards is easy to add & automate on the collector contract
* Governance is off-chain, and can be delegated via Snapshot.
* veBoost can be utilized.
* Aave holds a bigger supply share than CRV holdings

Main issues

* It’s not possible to delegate the gauge power on-chain which means that the collector contract would need to cast a new vote each time the veBAL allocation on gauges is updated.
* New functions should be added on the collector contract to claim BAL from several gauges.where the Treasury could deposit.
* As the voting power linearly decreases, the position requires to be relocked frequently to retain the max benefits. This part can be automated by Llama.
* The potential locked holdings would represent ~1,48% of the veBAL supply (good but not enough to sustain Aave DAO various plans mentioned in Part IV)

Moreover, the DAO could decide to allocate some funds on Balancer/Aura to optimize the yield, so these protocols should also be accessible from the reserve factor contract.

### Collector Contract Considerations

As it would be very inefficient to require AIP for each transaction, this option considers whitelisting the voting committee to manage the strategic positions on the collector contract from the multisig.

This solution keeps the decentralized ethos of the Aave DAO but is also the most complex to implement than simply delegating the management of the assets to the committee multisig.

* Implement all missing functions to interact with strategic protocols contracts such as Balancer/Aura, allowing to lock / periodically relock, claim, stake/unstake, updateBoost, add/remove liquidity, cast/update gauge votes
* Elect the voting committee and create the associated multisig
* Implement whitelists on the collector contract allowing the voting committee to handle the operations without requiring AIP for each transaction

### Voting Committee

The voting committee would manage the following tasks by having its multisig whitelisted on the collector contract:

* Lock/Relock the veTokens positions
* Cast votes on gauges
* Claim protocol fees
* Claim gauges rewards
* Update/sell veBoost
* Follow the strategy profitability
* Optimize amounts and create votes incentives
* Claim unspent rewards & DAO vote incentives
* Compound all strategic assets
* Transfer all yield (or remaining yield to the collector contract)

# Technical Implementation

* Elect the voting committee
* Deploy the multisig

# Voting Options

YAE - Proceed with Committee

NAE - No Committee

**Summary:**
> DFX Finance's proposal to add gauges for the DFX/ETH 50/50 [ETH] and DFX/TEL/USDC 40/40/20 [POL] pools

**References/Useful links:**

> Link to:
    • Website: [Main Website](https://dfx.finance/), [dApp](https://app.dfx.finance/)

    • Github Page: [Github](https://github.com/dfx-finance)
    • Communities [Telegram](https://t.me/DFX_Finance), [Discord](https://discord.dfx.finance/)

**Protocol Description:**

> DFX Finance is a decentralized foreign exchange (FX) protocol that facilitates the seamless exchange of fiat-backed stablecoins denominated in a growing number of currencies. Using a hyper-efficient AMM, optimized for low volatility trading, DFX provides FX swaps with rates that will beat any bank, money changer, or FX platform. DFX Pools currently have over $40M in TVL. DFX is the governance token of DFX Finance which allows users to vote on protocol changes and initiatives of the DAO, and also allows users to receive boosted emissions on deposits within the DFX ecosystem.

**Price History DFX:**

>Price History for DFX can be found on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dfx-finance)

**Motivation:**

> The DFX/ETH 50/50, and DFX/TEL/USDC 40/40/20, needs incentivization to migrate meaningful amounts of liquidity over to the Balancer ecosystem, and to bring higher trading volumes to Balancer. As well, DFX Finance is committed to engage in the Hiddenhand Finance ecosystem in a meaningful way to further deepen DFX liquidity onchain.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** DFX tokens serve as the governance token for the DFX Finance protocol. DFX token holders can vote on governance proposals through DFX’s snapshot. DFX forum is also used to discuss potential protocol changes and improvements.DFX Finance also has plans to transition to a veDFX model to further improve on decentralizing governance of the protocol.   

2. **Oracles:** DFX token does not rely on any external oracles. The DFX stablecoin pools uses Chainlink for its real world forex price feeds to facilitate efficient stablecoin swaps close to the spot price. The feeds can be found here: [Decentralized Price Reference Data | Chainlink](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/fiat)

3. **Audits:** DFX has engaged with multiple auditors including engagements with Trail of Bits, Haechi, and Zellic to audit the DFX smart contracts.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Treasury functions are controlled by a 2/4 multisig including treasury yield farming, and paying bribes.

5. **Market History:** DFX has been transferable since March 2021. The oldest DFX pool on Balancer is 230 days old, with the highest daily volume of $4M. There is currently $420,000 worth of DFX liquidity on Balancer.

Summary:

This ARC presents the community with the opportunity to add rETH to the Ethereum V3 market as a reserve.

Motivation

The stETH Reserve on Aave V2 is the largest Reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.47B in deposits, exceeding ETH ($1.33B) and USDC ($885M). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximizing strategy The demand for stETH has increased as a result of listing stETH on Aave V2, which has increased the revenue of both Aave & Lido protocols while increasing liquidity & stability of stETH.

LSDs (liquid staking derivative) assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets.

Onboarding LSDs is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience.

Aave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization.

Rocket Pool is a prime candidate to add diversity to Aave, being the second most liquid LSD asset in the ecosystem.

Specification
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

The Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Rocket Pool to push this proposal.
Increasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform.

The ACI received support from the rocket pool team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer rETH-related questions.

the ACI took inspiration from @Marceau previous ARC attempt work 5 and updated data & did edits

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?

Rocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol with permissionless Node Operators.
Rocket Pool provides a liquid staking experience for Ethereum stakers; they do not need to run a validator, and they can contribute any amount of ETH
rETH is a LSD token representing staked ETH.
The rETH liquid staking token accumulates value against ETH over time.
Simply swapping ETH for rETH (or buying it on a secondary market) provides access to Ethereum staking rewards.
Without a stake pool service, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions.
Rocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service which lowers the collateral threshold.
Abstracting staked ETH as rETH participants are able to retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership).
3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

rETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Rocket Pool node operators… Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, rETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value.
rETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens.
rETH is a good long term holding collateral but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans.
rETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave.
rETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave.
4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Rocket Pool has been active in the Ethereum community for over 5 years.
The Rocket Pool protocol went live on 9th November 2021. It was a staged rollout with full unlimited opening on 22 November 2021.
rETH supply has grown to 176k rETH backed by 185.6k ETH 2
The Rocket Pool protocol has a two DAO structure. More information on the Rocket Pool DAOs can be found here: Rocket Pool — Staking Protocol Part 2 | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium 2
5. How is the rETH token currently used?

Balancer LP of rETH/wETH 6 is the current primary use case of rETH with a liquidity of $53M

Uniswap V3 is second with $4.57M of liquidity

rETH is also used as collateral on makerDAO to mint DAI

image
1231×203 17.2 KB
It’s likely a Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of rETH holding.

See the community-maintained Defi Opportunities 7 document for additional use cases.

6. Emission schedule

There is no emission schedule.

rETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.

7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

rETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.

The Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities.
8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

Market capitalisation: $287 118 738
24H Volume ~$3.75M

Risk Analysis
A comprehensive risk analysis has been conducted by the Maker DAO risk team here is their report:

[rETH] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation 9

Risk parameters
The Following Risk parameters are the result of Chaos Labs & Gauntlet risk teams joint work.

As such, we recommend the following parameters:

Isolation Mode - No

While isolation mode provides newer, untested assets a safe backdrop to evolve, by only allowing stablecoin borrowing, in the context of rETH however, it excludes potentially the largest use case of rETH collateral, which is to borrow correlated assets in WETH or wstETH. Enabling in isolation mode will likely not capture how rETH collateral will likely be used, and as a result, only delays the path towards understanding rETH dynamics on the Aave markets. Unless the definition of Isolation Mode includes correlated assets to rETH, we recommend against initializing in isolation mode.

Borrowable - Yes

We are aware of the risk that comes with enabling small LSD borrowing. However, disabling borrowing for rETH (given the profile shown above) may be excessive and misses out on likely use cases for rETH. As demand for liquidity for liquid staking derivatives increases, disabling borrowing cuts off a potential revenue opportunity for Aave v3 - specifically WETH/wstETH supply + rETH borrowing. We believe a better way to balance this intrinsic risk and opportunity would be to allow borrowing rETH, thus giving the protocol an opportunity to explore this potential form of usage but mitigate tail risks via stringent borrow caps. This will allow rETH more time to evolve in the context of Aave’s markets.

LT - 74%; LTV 67%

We recommend lower parameters compared to wstETH of 79.5% to capture this difference in collateral quality that we’ve identified above.

LB - 7.5%

We recommend initializing with an LB of 7.5% to give liquidators slightly more incentive to liquidate rETH collateral, as compared to wstETH.

RF - 15%

LPF - 0.1

Debt Ceiling - NA

Supply Cap - 10K

Borrow Cap - 1200

Our analysis shows that initializing rETH with borrows enabled but with a stringent borrow cap - would be most beneficial to see how rETH evolves on the v3 markets.

| Symbol | Isolation Mode | Borrowable | Collateral Enabled | LTV | LT | LB | RF | LPF | Debt Ceiling | Supply Cap | Borrow Cap |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --- | -- | -- | -- | --- | ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| rETH   | NO             | YES        | YES                | 67% | 74%| 7.5%| 15%| 0.10| N/A         | 10K       | 1200      |


## Interest Rate Curve and Reserve Factor

rETH is similar to stETH, which has been listed on Ethereum v2 since last Spring, but since borrowing has always been disabled for stETH, we have no data about how users respond to changes in interest rates. As such, we recommend starting with conservative parameters that can be optimized later.

Parameter | Recommendation
--------- | -------------
Base | 0
Slope 1 | 0.07
Uoptimal | 0.45
Slope 2 | 3.0
Reserve Factor | 0.15

Under these parameters, the borrower interest rate increases linearly from 0% at 0% utilization to 7% at 45% utilization, and then linearly to 307% at 100% utilization. This interest rate curve matches that of the more volatile assets on Aave (1INCH, CRV, ENS, LINK, MKR, UNI). From a risk perspective, interest rate curves need to be designed to reduce the chances of utilization reaching 100%, which would prevent stakers from withdrawing rETH and prevent liquidators from seizing rETH collateral when performing liquidations. The proposed interest rate curve is thus desirable because it uses a low optimal utilization and has a high maximum interest rate.",neutral

### Title: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market
### Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
###  Date: 2024-06-04

---

### **Summary**
This proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. 

### **Motivation**

Artemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.

artMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).

artMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.

### Benefits of listing artMETIS

We believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.

- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.
- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.
- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.
- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.

### Chain to be deployed/listed

artMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.

Ticker: artMETIS

The Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.

Furthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.

Artemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.

In recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.

In summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.

373,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes XCAD Network ($XCAD) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new **90 days** Syrup Pool with XCAD Network! 

XCAD Network is a content creator tokenization platform where users can earn and trade their favourite creators' tokens.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn XCAD tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 285,800 XCAD
 - **Distribution duration:** 90 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 9 Nov 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 7 Feb 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.1102 XCAD

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the XCAD Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing an XCAD-CAKE farm.  


The farm will have 0.5x CAKE rewards for the first 7 days, then 0.2x rewards after that. At the end of the 90-day period – approx. 1100 UTC on 7 Feb 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0.1x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.2x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $XCAD?

From the team: “The use cases of XCAD are as follows:

- Govern creator’s decisions via a plugin which works directly on YouTube
- Stake to get access to Creator Liquidity Offering (CLO) - Launchpad for creators
- Stake to earn fan tokens on the Google Chrome Plug-in”

377,"# Summary

A proposal to increase stablecoin Interest Rate parameters across all Aave deployments.

## Motivation

Following the implementation of [AIP-375](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/375/) to increase stablecoin borrow rates across Aave V2 and V3 deployments, we continue to observe volatility in borrow rates across Aave deployments. As we [highlighted](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096/3) in the recent proposal, we recommend a more aggressive increase of the Slope1 parameter to stabilize borrows under the UOptimal point.

### Previous IR Curve modification impact analysis

**Stablecoins Total Supply and Borrow:** The data from the charts reflects an overall increase in both the supply and borrowing of stablecoins on the Ethereum V3 platform. From November 25th to December 12th we observed the following increases in supply and borrow across USDC, USDT, and DAI:
 
![image](ipfs://Qma9SeLwfVs7v6gFVLdQsGR8pHWVkiK8xnNjncMLFmmKEe)
    
We’ve observed an overall $49M increase (20.8%) in supply across USDC, USDT and DAI on Ethereum V3, and a $104M increase (45.4%) in borrows.
This general uptrend suggests that the AIP's changes were well received, with higher utilization for the assets following the parameter updates.

![Frame 78017.png](ipfs://QmZrFJXLiYdXkHazHzhQU9ztciMZhbmZW91fosSsPbS2k3)

 
![Frame 78018.png](ipfs://QmapwiVXKY9F8LAToEgAJMLTJUTD8qaHjM4jvHCtyCPfAF)
    

**Utilization Rate Analysis:** Our continuous monitoring of the utilization rates post AIP-375, setting Slope1 at 5%, shows sustained demand. When looking at the percentage of times in which utilization was above UOptimal, we can see that the AIP-375 increase didn’t stabilize the utilization at or below the UOptimal. This could also be due to changing market dynamics with the recent increase in crypto asset prices.

During two distinct 16-day intervals, we observed the following:

- **Pre-AIP-375 Period (11.09.23 - 11.25.23)**
- **Post-AIP-375 Period (11.25.23 - 12.12.23)**

**Percentage of Time of Utilization Above UOptimal:**

| Asset | Before AIP-375 | After AIP-375 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USDC | 69.53% | 77.34% |
| USDT | 63.02% | 33.09% |
| DAI | 48.70% | 63.24% |

 
![Frame 78019 (1).png](ipfs://QmeVmhQjvUfCyx8X1Dioriz5rmcMQNVP4xRr1bcGomF3Ye)
    
The data demonstrates strong borrowing activity persisting after the interest rate curve adjustments, supporting a move towards higher interest rates. This pattern reflects a consistent, resilient demand among the top stablecoins on Ethereum V3.

**Borrow Rate Analysis:** After executing the previous proposal, we continue to observe fluctuations in borrow rates, suggesting the previous increase did not achieve the anticipated stabilization. This situation suggests that further adjustments of the interest rate parameters are necessary to achieve more consistent and stable borrowing rates.

### Recommendation

**Adjust Slope1 of stablecoins to 6%**

The analysis indicates a necessity for further refinement of stablecoin interest rates, to achieve a more predictable and stable borrowing rate with an equilibrium utilization under the UOptimal point. 
Therefore, we propose increasing Slope1 to 6% for stablecoins across all Aave deployments, in this iteration. Following this increase, we will continue monitoring the usage and equilibrium rate and make additional recommendations as necessary.

379,"As there has been renewed interest for buy and burn and the original discussion didn't allow for a choice between the two (governance participants had made a choice for distribution to veCRV holders), community members have asked us to resubmit those two options for a signalling vote.

**Important to note, the outcome of this signalling tool does not change the implementation of the admin fee (and its current vote https://dao.curve.fi/vote/parameter/2 ) , only how it will be distributed.**

**In light of recent manipulation in two different discourse polls (gold + buy and burn vs veCRV distribution), it's worth nothing discourse polls will not be considered anymore going forward.**

Read more and discuss: https://gov.curve.fi/t/cip-14-buy-and-burn-vs-distribution-to-vecrv-holders/759

Options:

1. **Buy and burn**  - Buy and burn would currently destroy around 5% (1.75% of daily circulation inflow) of the daily CRV inflation.

2. **veCRV holders Distribution** - Current locked supply is around 10% which could result in APY of over 250% meaning rough calculations suggest distribution to veCRV holders will likely remove selling pressure more effectively as people vote lock for their boost and receive fees. Seeing the total vote locked double from 10% to 20% seems realistic which would remove over 10% of the daily inflation against 1.75% for the buy and burn option.",bullish

Graphic tees transform into motion graphic tees; street art unlocks interactive NFTs; trading cards become living highlight reels; album covers reveal hidden songs & lyrics; IRL events bring digital to the physical. All powered by ApeCoin.

#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:
##### Community Benefit #1: Access to State-of-the-Art Technology, Tools & Resources for Creative Entrepreneurs
- State-of-the-art AR technology is cost prohibitive for most independent artists & creatives. Since 2019, my company has been powering app-less AR experiences for brands, solving friction-laden user experience problems. Therefore, this proposal would fund the ability to empower accepted applicants with our already built zero-code, zero-download AR software used by brands from Paramount Pictures to Compass Real Estate.
- Along with this technology, we provide the advisory resources for the Launchpad participants to follow best practices & achieve success with their physical-meets-digital releases.
- This proposal then empowers creatives & furthers the entrepreneurial ecosystem that is Web3. Each project that emerges from the Ape.AR Launchpad
will produce an augmented product or experience, with a requisite to incorporate $APE as its exclusive currency.

##### Community Benefit #2: Augmented Utility for Collectors
- Through collecting NFTs, I quickly realized that AR technology can even further solve key problems endemic to the Web3 ecosystem. Specifically, it can be leveraged to bridge multiple divides: between physical and digital, between story and product, between online & IRL. In aggregate, this also solves the collector’s greatest concern by offering cohesive, comprehensive, continual utility.
- Both a connection to and extension of the jpeg itself, our AR technology can take any still object, location, or image, regardless of where it appears, bringing it to life with motion and sound. 2D & 3D animations, video, audio, rich text, 360 portals. Once static artworks become dynamic & life-like with personality, stories & journeys.
- Even further, all of the digital layers can be updated anytime, over time, real-time. This presents the potential for utility, or continuous value, in perpetuity. Augmented, unfolding stories. These stories can be strictly narrative, practical like early access to NFT drops, or a combination. Content drops layered onto physical product drops.

##### Community Benefit #3: Onboarding New Web3 Participants
- An indirect consequence of bridging the physical & digital divide with AR may eventually become its most important Web3 legacy: bridging the world of NFT early adopters & the rest of the world.
- Products like motion graphic tees & experiences like interactive murals expose new audiences to the digital art we experience daily in Web3. But instead of leading with the technicalities of NFTs & blockchain, we lead with the visual stories - what the tokens represent - as digital layers to our physical realities. Newcomers get immersed in the intrinsic value of art before the financial value of art. Actual appreciation before financial appreciation. True, authentic, sustainable onboarding.
- Then, given our layered approach to AR, newcomers can be presented with options to collect the motion art at the point of experience via available frictionless NFT solutions.
- This expansive & inclusive worldview results in expanding the Web3 ecosystem to include new, interested & eventually active participants.

##### Community Benefit #4: ApeCoin Commerce
- $APE will be the exclusive payment method for all of the Ape.AR Launchpad collections. All of the resulting products will also include a “Powered by ApeCoin” logo.
- Through this physical-meets-digital new use case, Ape.AR will generate new demand for $APE. This benefits the entire community, serving the vision of ApeCoin as the currency of choice for creative capital in Web3. A flywheel effect takes place when Ape.AR Launchpad projects successfully go to market & generate even greater interest for ApeCoin DAO.

#### OVERALL COST

Title: [ARFC] Deployment of Aave on zkSync
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-10

---

# **Summary**

The current ARFC proposes deploying Aave V3 on zkSync to leverage the scalability and cost-efficiency of zk-Rollups. By integrating with zkSync, Aave can offer users faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum mainnet. This ARFC seeks governance approval for the deployment of an Aave V3 instance on the zkSync Era L2.

## Motivation

zkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that utilizes zk-Rollups to batch multiple transactions off-chain and submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach significantly enhances transaction throughput and reduces gas fees. Deposit and borrowing activities can greatly benefit from the reduced transaction costs and increased throughput offered by zkSync.

### Benefits of deploying to zkSync

1. **Reduce Gas Fees:** By leveraging zkSync’s efficient transaction processing, users will incur significantly lower gas fees.
2. **Scalability:** zkSync’s high throughput will allow Aave to scale effectively, accommodating more users and transactions without compromising performance.
3. **New Frontier & Opportunities:** This deployment will offer the Aave DAO a new frontier for growth to explore and a new avenue path for GHO, our stablecoin.
4. **Interoperability:** Due to zkSync infrastructure, an Aave V3 deployment in the zkSync Era can benefit other Aave family products, such as Lens on a segregated layer with GHO, making it a mutually beneficial relationship.

## Specification

### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments
1. Aave DAO commits to redistribute to Aave users via liquidity mining, GHO secondary liquidity incentives, safety module deployments, or merit programs any airdrop provided by the zkSync ecosystem.
2. ACI, on behalf of the Aave DAO, will coordinate any liquidity mining campaign on a zkSync Aave V3 deployment.

### Introduction

There are some significant changes compared to the last funding proposal and I welcome community feedback as always.

After discussions with other leaders in the ecosystem in the wake of [BIP-149](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-149-funding-proposal-for-silverlight-labs-revised/4241)’s failure to pass it was decided that Maxis should step into the role of project management. This is in addition to Maxis assuming the role of partnerships & business development in Q4. Despite having significantly more responsibilities, we are not raising net compensation, but we are re-assessing how each Maxi is compensated. Please see the following table for monthly salary specifics.



Some Maxis have opted to take some or all of their compensation in liquid BAL for various reasons. While my salary is increasing to reflect the increased importance of Maxis in the ecosystem I will continue to lock 100% and max re-lock my previous salaries. This is to ensure I have skin in the game and remain highly motivated to ensure Maxis execute at a high level in all of our areas of operation. I’ll point out that net USD compensation is decreasing by nearly 3% while net BAL compensation is decreasing 20% to reflect a higher BAL price compared to last quarter.

Additionally, we are requesting an allocation of 1500 BAL to be used for 3rd party dev bounties. This will be led by Tritium as we look to expand the development capacity of Maxis and automate more of our routine tasks. We will present a detailed accounting of how these 1500 BAL are spent in our monthly updates and the next funding proposal.

Finally, instead of asking for BAL for gas expenses we’ll instead ask for 5 ETH from the treasury. We will also continue the 5000 BAL per month for Coordinape.

------------------------------------------------

**Service Provider Name:** Balancer Maxis

**Leader(s):** Solarcurve, joined by the returning cast of Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Danko, and Tritium.

**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** Yes

**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):** Yes

**Domains of Operation + Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**

As Balancer pursues its path for further decentralization, the Balancer Maxis workgroup presents community contributors aligned with the protocol's future and long-term sustainability. Whether proposing and executing innovative ideas, or protecting the interests of the ecosystem and helping third-party projects, Maxis have proven to be a key component of Balancer.

Our Q2 proposal is effectively asking veBAL Governance for the continuation of this decentralized collaboration group. Reading the previous [Q1 funding post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-145-fund-the-balancer-maxis-for-q1-2023/4208) might bring some additional context to the present proposal.The following will be kept brief and at a high level. More granular metrics can be found in our monthly updates for [January](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-january-2023-update/4333), [February](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-february-2023-update/4457), and March.

*Multisig Management*

* Linear (boosted) pool settings
* Swap fee and amplification adjustments
* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL
* Adding new reward tokens to gauges
* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees
* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig
* Together with Balancer Labs we operate the Emergency subDAO Multisig

These are some of the basic functions required to ensure smooth operation of the Balancer Protocol for all its end users. We believe the best metric for success is that most users are not even aware that these tasks exist – they simply observe a new gauge being approved by voters then appearing on the voting list or find protocol fees in the claim section every week, etc. Maxis ensure that the various multisigs and their relevant functions are used properly and promptly, and all transactions are verified for accuracy by at least two people.

*Governance*

* We act as verifiers of last resort for BIPs that require on-chain execution and we post BIPs ready for a vote on snapshot - though anyone with 200k veBAL can also post to snapshot.
* Active participants in Discord and the Forum on governance topics
* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)
* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process
* Manage admin of the Governance Forum
* We will pursue various strategic initiatives (such as BIP-19) at our discretion, either individually or as a group.

During Q1 Balancer governance passed [BIP-163](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-163-restructure-governance-process-disband-governance-council/4244) which represented a pivotal step forward in decentralization of the governance process. Anyone with at least 200k veBAL can now post proposals to snapshot. This BIP also introduced a new process for verifying mutlisig payloads for BIPs that require on-chain execution. Maxis fill the role of “verifier of last resort” to ensure Balancer governance can continue to operate, though anyone can submit a multisig payload and/or verify its accuracy.

*Partnerships*

* We manage Balancer’s Discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed
* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions
* We often deploy new pools for other projects
* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists
* We help with UI testing for Balancer
* Seek out new opportunities to apply Balancer’s technology, primarily in the DeFi realm
* Manage relationships with partners across the entire lifecycle from initial conversations to implementation to final results
* Coordinate partner needs with other teams in the Balancer ecosystem, e.g. integrations.

Maxis took the lead on partnerships in the Balancer ecosystem during Q4 2022 after the biz dev team at Orb was dissolved. The primary near term goals are expanding boosted pool offerings focused primarily on Aave v3, encouraging adoption of ve80/20 or similar systems, and increasing utilization of the veBAL flywheel (projects bribing, parking POL, etc). Generally we believe Balancer has made solid progress over the last few months despite the various issues we’ve faced like the read only reentrancy bug and the Euler hack.

*Community*

* We manage a monthly Coordinape circle, open to all DAO contributors
* Onboarding framework for new contributors
* Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO or between SPs

Having an open community for new contributors wanting to join the Balancer ecosystem is a great concern for us. By adopting an easy and seamless onboarding framework, every applicant is being reached through discovery calls and monthly follow-ups. We help contributors understand the DAO operating framework (BIP-1) and set in motion their ideas for Balancer. By keeping contributors engaged, we aim to retain talents in the Balancer ecosystem as Ballers, Grantees or shaping their own Service Provider.

*Project Management*

* Lead weekly meetings with team leads across the ecosystem to align on projects in flight
* Be the driving force behind the ecosystem’s top roadmap priorities and be accountable for their delivery
* Track project dependencies across the teams and coordinate among relevant parties

Maxis assumed the role of project management for the ecosystem in Q1. We are well positioned for this as we are the point of contact for outside teams & projects and we have established working relationships with all internal teams. Our experience in executing various initiatives in the last 9 months means we have a lot of insight into what it takes to take a project from start to finish.

*Record Keeping*

* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.

**Length of Engagement & Budget:**

3 months.

Budget of 8,550 BAL per month for salaries, of which 60% will be max locked in veBAL by contributors. We also request an additional monthly allocation of 5,000 BAL for Coordinape, a quarterly allocation of 
 1500 BAL for dev bounties, and a quarterly allocation of 5 ETH for gas expenses.

Total for 3 month engagement: 42,150 BAL+ 5 ETH

Impact on the Treasury: The Treasury currently holds ~4.4M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q2 would cost around 1% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~4% of the treasury’s BAL.

390,"Title: [Temp Check] - Community Preference for Supply Cap Limits for LSTs

Author: @ChaosLabs

Dated: 2023-04-18

## Summary

The current supply cap methodologies of the risk managers on Aave V3 incorporate a high-bound of 50% of an asset's on-chain circulating supply to mitigate counterparty and concentration risk.

In the discussion around supply cap increases for MaticX and stMatic, the community has questioned this limit due to these LSTs' price feeds and redeemability mechanisms,  making counterparty risk the primary concern.

## Mission

The following vote aims to gauge the community's preference concerning limiting the supply caps for LSTs, which will be considered in future supply cap recommendations. The options are:

* Option 1 - Limit supply cap to 50% of on-chain circulating supply
* Option 2 - Limit supply cap to 75% of on-chain circulating supply
* Option 3 - Do not limit the supply cap as a percentage of the circulating supply",bearish
391,"PanCakeSwap Improvement Protocol (PIP) XXX: Integration of Privacy Enhancing protocol for PancakeSwap

Abstract: This PcakeIP proposes the integration of privacy-enhancing technologies into the PancakeSwap decentralized exchange to improve the privacy and security of its users. The proposed technologies include Ring Signatures, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Stealth Addresses, and Coin Mixing using CoinJoin.

Motivation: Privacy is a crucial aspect of decentralized finance, and PancakeSwap is no exception. The lack of privacy in public blockchains is a significant limitation for users who wish to keep their transactions and balances private. The implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies can help users protect their privacy and improve the overall security of PancakeSwap. Pancake Swap's current level of privacy and anonymity is limited due to its public ledger, which allows anyone to view all transactions and trace them back to their source. This has led to concerns about the privacy and security of Pancake Swap users, as well as potential regulatory pressures and censorship. To address these issues, we propose the integration of privacy-enhancing technologies, similar to what Satoshi Nakamoto foresaw in the original Bitcoin white paper.

Proposal and Technical Specifications:

We propose the direct implementation of four privacy-enhancing features in the Pancake Swap protocol:

CoinJoin: CoinJoin is a technique that allows multiple Pancake Swap transactions to be combined into a single transaction, making it more difficult for outside observers to determine which inputs correspond to which outputs. By joining transactions together, CoinJoin can help obfuscate the origin and destination of Pancake Swap transactions. We propose that CoinJoin be implemented directly in the Pancake Swap protocol using a new opcode.
zk-SNARKs: zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) are a type of zero-knowledge proof that allows for private transactions on the Pancake Swap network. Using zk-SNARKs, users can prove that they own a certain amount of Pancake Swap tokens without revealing any details about the transaction or their identity. We propose that zk-SNARKs be implemented in the Pancake Swap protocol using a new transaction format.
Ring Signatures: Ring signatures allow users to sign a message without revealing which user actually signed it. This can help protect the privacy and anonymity of Pancake Swap users, as it makes it more difficult for third parties to determine who is behind a particular transaction. We propose that ring signatures be implemented in the Pancake Swap protocol using a new opcode.
Stealth Addresses: Stealth addresses allow users to generate a new address for each transaction, making it more difficult for outside observers to track the flow of Pancake Swap tokens. This can help enhance privacy on the network, as it makes it more difficult for third parties to link transactions together. We propose the implementation of stealth addresses in the Pancake Swap protocol by following the same process outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper.
Implementation

By implementing these privacy-enhancing features, Pancake Swap can offer its users a greater level of privacy and security while preserving the decentralized nature of the protocol. The implementation of these features would help to ensure that Pancake Swap remains a viable and competitive decentralized exchange in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. These technologies would greatly enhance the privacy and security of the PancakeSwap DEX. We recommend direct implementation into the protocol to preserve users' privacy and maintain a decentralized trustless permissionless system the true Financial freedom envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.",neutral

393,"This proposal is a continuation of the topic from VIP-51. Previously, several VRT Swap & XVS Vesting architecture designs were proposed that differed from the original design summarized in the Venus Tokenomics 2 published in August of 2021. One of these alternative designs, referred to as “fixed speed vesting” proposed a vesting schedule that would have allowed all XVS to vest very quickly if VRT was separated into a multitude of accounts and deposited separately. This potential workaround required a countermeasure in the form of a global daily limit on all deposits. Many in the community pointed out concerns regarding this daily limit from a technical and user experience perspective.

We considered feedback regarding the daily limit and how this unfairly allows those with bots to consume the daily quota before everyone else each day. There is no technically feasible way to prevent this issue with the fixed speed model, so we are proposing deployment of the original swap & vesting design.

This proposal is adapted from [its original](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-for-a-1m-cap-for-rpl/250) just so that the change would be a valid one according to the current rules described [here](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217).

======

RPL appears to be a coin with a purpose and a real use case.
The $26,465,785 70 RPL - 30 WETH pool is one of the biggest on Balancer and earns BAL at a rate of $10m worth of BAL/year.

Unfortunately it generates very little volume with 24h volumes oscilating in low tens of thousands of USD, last 24h volume: $30,891

A $2m pool would be enough to facilitate low slippage trading for such volumes so I propose reducing the BAL rewards cap to reduce from 10m *to 3m*. I think that the $10m yearly worth of rewards could be used to encourage other, more useful liquidity.

On top of the low trading volumes and low interest from traders, my subjective opinion is that the valuation is artificially inflated, I’m not happy about heavy concentration of this pool in hands of a single liquidity provider (90% single LP, recently >97%). CMC shows that this coin trades >$900k on Bilaxy and >300k on LBank within 24h which I find hard to believe. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rocket-pool/markets",bullish

### Goal of the vote
Establish policies and guidelines on Temperature Check Votes held on snapshot for 0x DAO. **This is a second iteration after a first vote on this matter, removing one of the requirements (minimum addresses).**

### Scope
The purpose of snapshot proposals is to gauge community sentiment on serious topics under consideration for onchain governance votes that impact 0x protocol.

Temperature checks are non-binding. For example, while a temperature check might indicate community support to introduce a change in smart contracts, a team will have to submit a complete ZEIP vote to come into effect. The same applies to Treasury proposals, which always require an onchain-binding vote.

The domain upon which the community of ZRX holders has decision-making power includes:

- 0x protocol (smart contracts and their deployments)
- [0x Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0bb1810061c2f5b2088054ee184e6c79e1591101)
- [ZRX Portal UI](https://0x.org/zrx)
- ZRX token

**Posts regarding airdrops and frontend integrators (such as Matcha) do not meet these criteria and will be deleted.**

### Process and requirements
- Temperature checks can be initiated by any ZRX holder or delegate with a voting power of **at least 10k (ten thousand) ZRX**.
- A link to an existing discussion on gov.0x.org must be provided in the description of the vote.
- The vote is considered valid once it reaches a **quorum of 1M (one million) ZRX** ~~with at least 50 addresses voting~~. The quorum is intended to be set on the winning option (not on the sum of votes on all options).
- A temperature check vote must last **at least 5 days**. In case of tighter deadlines, a 3 days (72 hours) duration could be accepted.
Any proposal that does not meet the criteria will be either ignored or deleted from the space.

399,"**Overview**

Since its founding via a timely Uniswap Governance governance proposal in 2021, the [DeFi Education Fund ](https://www.defieducationfund.org/) (DEF) has fought to advance and protect the potential of DeFi in the public policy sphere. The threat that misguided policies and overreaching regulators pose to DeFi has never been clearer. This proposal is to provide DEF with one million UNI tokens in two tranches to support them in fulfilling their mission.

DeFi promises to revolutionize how people engage in economic activities. In particular, the openly accessible and decentralized characteristics of DeFi protocols means that anyone with an internet connection and a wallet can participate in the global economy in a way that would not be possible without DeFi. To do so, DeFi upends the structure of traditional financial services and related policy making approaches. That upending has brought with it intense interest, suspicion, and hostility from entrenched interests and regulatory bodies around the world.

DEF has defended DeFi from legislative threats that would require DeFi developers to implement protocol access restrictions or requirements designed for CeFi businesses; regulatory proposals that would mandate centralization if finalized; and in the courts against overzealous regulators. In late March, we sued the SEC over its policy on airdrops and its campaign of regulation by enforcement that is crippling DeFi and crypto development and participation in the United States.

Over the last few years, DeFi’s policy challenges have become more real, more imminent, and more numerous. For example, in the U.S. alone, there are at least half a dozen bills actively under consideration in Congress and two rulemakings pending finalization that would effectively prohibit DeFi development. Luckily, public policy education and advocacy has borne—and can continue to bear—fruit for DeFi.

Without doubt, building a public policy environment welcoming of DeFi and decentralized governance will be a long and arduous struggle, but we know that Uniswap Governance shares our commitment to winning that debate—and it is winnable—so that the benefits of DeFi can be felt and enjoyed by as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.

DEF is eager to continue leading the fight on behalf of DeFi. With additional resources, we can build out our team:

1. super charge our impact litigation efforts to reshape the legal landscape to DeFi and DAOs’ benefit;
2. expand our outreach to legislators and double down on our educational efforts;
3. more vigorously challenge the regulatory onslaught targeting DeFi; and
4. enhance our ability to engage in state-level debates and jurisdictions outside of the United States.

If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from the myriad policy risks it faces while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing and appreciate your consideration.

**Rationale**

DeFi’s policy challenges are immense and interest in DeFi has only grown since the DEF got to work in 2021. Following the collapse of FTX and with the return of the bull market, there is acute interest in DeFi on Capitol Hill and state legislatures, as well as inside federal and state government agencies. Providing meaningful educational outreach about DAOs and DeFi to lawmakers while also assisting in the legal defense of decentralized organizations is a role not played by anyone else in the US.

At this time, DAOs and DeFi protocols face several potentially catastrophic threats: a live IRS proposal would mandate the creation of intermediaries to conduct tax reporting (i.e., ban on disintermediated systems) and a live SEC rulemaking would define anyone loosely related to a DeFi protocol—including the underlying chain’s miners/validators—to be national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, bills written to regulate CeFi often inadvertently capture DeFi protocols and subject them to compliance obligations designed for CeFi businesses.

If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while laying the foundation for longterm proactive policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. There is a reason TradFi businesses collectively spend over $1 billion per year on U.S. lobbying and policy efforts: it works, and we’re making it work for DeFi.

DEF focuses specifically on fighting for policy outcomes favorable to decentralized finance developers and users on the ground in Washington, DC. A summary of our past work, which has included defending DAOs in court, as well as providing comment and consultation to regulators to avoid burdensome rules and regulations in the US and around the world, below. This proposal would expand our budget so that we can expand our legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy and education efforts on behalf of DeFi and DAO developers and users.

If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from policy risks while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing, and we appreciate your consideration.

**Conclusion**

The DeFi Education Fund is a nonprofit organization with a demonstrated history of being in the trenches fighting for DAOs and decentralized finance. Whether looking to provide legal assistance when DAOs and their members are targeted, providing educational resources, or fighting for policy changes, the DeFi Education Fund is the only major crypto advocate that focuses solely on decentralized web3.

**FAQs**

*Why are you raising money now if you have about two years of runway at your current burn?*

We are seeking Uniswap Governance’s further support now for three primary reasons.

First, we need a good sense of our longer term funding in order to expand our efforts and take on the long term projects that our work often requires, which can play out over several years. For example, our legal challenge of the patent covering oracle tech that is being used against DAOs will likely take a total of at least two years from start to finish. Our lawsuit against the SEC will probably last several years. If we did not have a good expectation of being able to operate two years after starting those efforts, we would not have been able to take them on at all. In addition, because we hold tokens long term, we are exposed to crypto market price fluctuations.

Second, unexpected, ad hoc projects that we are well-positioned to take on in defense of DeFi can be extremely expensive. For example, we expect the challenge to the oracle patent to cost nearly $500,000 over its entire course. A legal challenge to proposed rules that would de facto ban DeFi in the United States would cost well over $1m. We have no ability to predict with certainty when and if those expenditures will be necessary, and without a sense of our longer term funding situation, we can’t take on those types of unexpected, but critical, projects while also expanding our day to day efforts and team.

DeFi needs more dedicated advocates working on its behalf. With a larger budget, we can hire more people.

*When and how would you plan on selling this proposal’s tokens?*

It is important to us that DEF remains aligned with the DeFi community and our supporters over the long term. Upon passage, 500k $UNI tokens would be transferred to DEF’s on-chain Coinbase $UNI [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb39cb7Eb25CE07470Fb59F7548979Fae0Bb85824), and 500k would be locked up in a streaming contract that would “vest” linearly over 12 months. Governance could vote to stop the streaming of the remaining tokens at any time.

We will hold half of any tokens we receive for at least 12 months from the date we receive them, and we will pre-disclose all sales plans in writing.

*How are you going to keep Uniswap Governance up to date on your activities?*

The DEF team will host monthly community calls that Uniswap community members can join to hear updates on our work, learn about high priority policy and regulatory developers, and have questions answered. We’ll also keep a thread on the Uniswap governance forum up to date with our monthly updates.

*What about the tokens from the 2021 proposal?*

We received our initial grant of one million $UNI tokens from the Uniswap Governance in July 2021 and sold half of the tokens shortly thereafter. In February 2024, we began selling portions of the other half of the tokens according to an 18 month written [sales plan](https://www.defieducationfund.org/post/def-provides-update-on-our-funding). We will sell in July 2025 the last of the UNI tokens we received in July 2021.

*Why are you asking us for money and not other DAOs?*

We are, and we will definitely continue to “pass around the hat”! We seek Uni governance’s continued support as a community that is building for the long term. Uniswap Governance took a massive “leap of faith” in generously funding an organization that did not yet exist to do work that would benefit every DeFi project and DAO. We hope that our track record of work has proven valuable to DeFi projects and users such that Uni governance and other projects’ governance will continue to contribute to our work going forward.

403,"##### ABSTRACT
Ape Express aims to launch the ultimate toolkit for a thriving memecoin ecosystem on ApeChain, empowering users with the tools they need to create, customize and deploy tokens on ApeChain.

With Ape Express no technical skills are needed for safe, unruggable launches. Configure and deploy your token with multiple features in seconds.

Streamlined liquidity management: borrow, deploy, and lock liquidity effortlessly. Developers can deploy an LP using borrowed capital, and launch a coin with a starting market cap of $15K while spending only $300 out of pocket. 
Liquidity loans can be automatically repaid from token taxes, liquidity, or manual payment.

In one place users can create their brand identity, deploy tokens, manage liquidity, build and engage their community. (Think Pump.fun on ApeChain, but way better and less trash. For instance, on Pump.fun tokens start with 1K MC, and never have a chance to reach a DEX. With our system, every launch makes it to the DEX of choice and encourages a free open market on ApeChain.)

Token creators will have an option and be encouraged to airdrop portion of their supply to the holders of the blue chip collections of Yuga ecosystem. BAYC/MAYC/BAKC, CryptoPunks, Kodas, Moonbirds and Mocaverse holders.

This will bring benefit to the holders of these collections and, at the same time, give the upcoming projects an opportunity to reach the high quality user bases that are the lifeblood of these collections.

All of these processes are streamlined in the dapp so that anyone can do it with a few clicks of a button.

This project aims to expand the ApeCoin ecosystem, increase token velocity, TVL and offer new opportunities for the builders in the ApeChain ecosystem.

None of the funds requested in this proposal will be spent on development or team salary. This proposal aims to bootstrap platform liquidity and the Ape Express marketing budget.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
1. Ape Express will give 10% of all gross revenue from platform fees back to the Apecoin DAO’s treasury.
2. Onboarding memecoin degens from other chains and converting this liquidity into $APE.
3. Boosting APE liquidity pairs: Ape Express encourages users to pair their tokens with $APE by automatically converting ETH, USDT, and other assets used on the platform into $APE. By locking APE in LPs we contribute to the overall TVL of the ApeChain.
4. Amplifying on-chain activity: by facilitating fast and easy token creation and trading of memecoins, we drive overall transactions volume. Memecoin trading volume on Solana accounts for $1.2B daily, and over $120M in volume on Base chain. We drive transaction volume to the ApeChain native DEX.
5. Enhancing APE token velocity: gas fees, liquidity loans, and buybacks will all utilize $APE.

PLATFORMS & TECHNOLOGIES:
* Smart contracts for deploying tokens
* Smart contracts for lending liquidity & liquidity locker built-in
* Smart contracts and mechanisms for clawing back lent out liquidity

We have created our own set of contracts which interact with each other, giving as much fluidity and flexibility to the system as possible. Users simply pay for token minting, which is dependent on how many features they are including in the token. This acts as initial revenue for the product to safeguard minor expenses with regard to the deploying costs(the user’s token and other related contracts per product deployed), and liquidity rounding errors from the lending activities.

There are several ways for users to repay the loans:
* Direct payment: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, repay a direct 12,500 APE to receive ownership of LP tokens (albeit locked until the lock period is over)
* Tax Tokens: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and passively repay 12,500 APE as taxes are generated from the trading activity of the token. All taxes are diverted to repaying the loan until completed. The creator will then receive ownership of the LP, and release it to their creator’s address when the lock period is over.
* Liquidity Threshold: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and as the liquidity pool grows from net buying activity, a loan with interest is repaid via clawback. This means the user can select a 2x with a 25% interest to repay 12,500 APE when the liquidity pool contains at least 20,000 APE. This approach is generally regarded to be safest when a higher threshold is selected (as high as 5x is available). This process is an automated repayment method.

Another product is the liquidity locker. All created tokens are automatically opted into this feature with a minimum of 30 days, which begins when the loan is repaid in full. Tokens created outside the platform can also use this feature given they make a small payment in APE tokens. The lock period ranges from 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

Finally, Ape Express will be equipped with a mass sender contract and UI. This is for any creator wanting to do an airdrop or presale distribution manually.

Ape Express’ GTM strategy will include a referral/discount coupon program, initially to be issued by team members. In addition, APE stakers (10k tokens staked and up) will be able to generate their own referral and discount codes customizable up to 20% referral/discount mix.

An incentive program will also be put into action if approved for a grant. The tokens with the most activity, measured by volume and holders, will be awarded APE tokens every week for the token’s creator/treasury. These metrics are reset every week to further incentivize only currently active projects or new projects to receive such rewards.

Although we cant stop people from creating NSFW tickers on a permissionless blockchain we will have measures on our backend to hide any racist, hateful or pornographic material from our leaderboards. We can control what is represented on our platform and we will carefully monitor this to make sure we are in line with Apecoin guidelines

404,"Hi Team and fellow PCS users
This proposal aims to get the though process started(Add to roadmap) to support multiple smart chains on PCS. So far we are entirly locked to BSC which has given PCS its dominant position as #1 Defi platform on this chain. No problems at all with this and im sure PCS users are happy with the platform

I would like to propose that the planning start to allow for multiple chains(Solana, ETH2, Cardano etc) be supported on PCS which would open up an entirly new world of DEFI investing to PCS users. Why let these other platforms take users and their funds away from PCS when they can stay on the same familiar platform yet invest across chains

We got to #1 on BSC because the team behind this knows how to grow a platform. Lets spread our wings a little and dominate across multiple chains

How say you?!?",bearish

**Summary:**
> This proposal aims to approve the creation of a gauge with a 2% cap for baoUSD/LUSD Composable stable pool.
If the gauges are added, Bao intends to build on their locked BAL position as well as incentivise voters to vote for the pool and seed liquidity in the pool
The baoUSD/LUSD Balancer pool will act as a base pool for Bao USD liquidity gauges.

> * Github Page• https://github.com/baofinance 
> * Communities• https://discord.com/invite/BW3P62vJXT, https://twitter.com/BaoCommunity


**Protocol Description:**

> Bao Finance is a community-run protocol creating synthetic assets and markets for any data. Our first synth, baoUSD, is backed by debt positions created in our vaults, and stable assets via its PSM.
>
> BaoUSD is minted by whitelisted contracts, which currently are “the fed” and “the ballast”. The Bao multisig has control over which contracts are whitelisted. Changes are approved via governance.
>
> The fed mints baoUSD into our vaults, ready to be borrowed against highly liquid collaterals. Controlling the borrowable supply also affects the variable loan interest rate, helping maintain the peg.
>
> The baoUSD ballast mints baoUSD when supplied with DAI at a 1:1 ratio. While there is DAI available, baoUSD can be burned to claim DAI at a 1:1 ratio. The baoUSD “mint limit” is controlled by the BAO multisig.
>
> Bao also issues basket tokens, representing an index of underlying tokens with the option to a yield strategy. These underlying assets are not tradeable with each other, so don’t suffer from the same risk vectors as an LP position, where a single asset could destroy the value of the entire position, or pool balances can be manipulated into an exploitable state. Each basket token represents the holders’ share of underlying assets. It can be minted with a supply asset (ETH, DAI), which is traded for the underlying assets and deposited into their yield strategy. Underlying assets can be redeemed at any time by basket token holders. The composition of each basket is managed via governance.
>
>bSTBL is Bao's first basket and is designed to be ideal collateral for baoUSD, focusing on the industry’s lowest risk, most liquid stable-coins, and the safest yield strategies. Using bSTBL as collateral for baoUSD allows highly liquid, stable, and yield-bearing collateral whose underlying assets and strategies can be adapted over time with the market, without relying on users to alter their positions. The current composition of bSTBL is 50% DAI and 50% USDC.
>
>Further baskets and synthetics are planned in the future, beginning with the upcoming bETH and baoETH, which will work similarly to bSTBL and baoUSD.
>
>Currently the only exchange with baoUSD liquidity is curve. The baoUSD/3crv pool can be found here: https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-84/swap 5


**Motivation:**

> We would like Balancer to become an essential marketplace for our synthetics. Integrations outside our liquidity gauges are key to sustainability. Balancer was chosen to create Bao’s USD base pool, baoUSD/LUSD, because it is easy to pair with any other token whether stable or volatile. Bao intends to use this property to increase adoption of baoUSD by allowing other projects to pair with this pool and incentivise it with Bao emissions on the Bao Finance platform. If successful, the balancer community will benefit from their growing adoption through trading fees and boosts to liquidity in addition to bribes to vote for the pool.


**Specifications:**
 
> 1. Governance: Currently baoUSD is governed by the BAO community. Actions voted on are carried out by the community “council of guardians” via its 4/7 multi-sig. This multisig/ council of guardians controls various baoUSD parameters like it's mint limit and collaterals. The council of guardians includes at least one member of each permanent Galaxy (sub team), and any guardian can be recalled at any time via public vote. We plan on using governor bravo or similar in the future to improve decentralization.

> 2. Oracles: Chainlink oracles are used to find collateral prices.

> 3. Audits: Bao re-uses battle-tested compound, inverse, and curve code with some changes and is in the process of auditing

> 4. Centralization vectors: The 4/7 multisig controls the supply of baoUSD available in the PSM and lending market. Other parameters under the multisig control are collateral factors, IMF factor (CF factor reduces as loan size increases), liquidation incentive, ability to deposit collateral, price oracle, new collateral additions.

> 5. Market History: baoUSD has been closely pegged since its inception and has robust, battle-tested mechanisms to help it stay pegged. It did suffer a similar depeg to USDC recently, primarily due to most of the available liquidity being in pools containing USDC and DAI. Steps are being taken to reduce reliance on USDC.

> 6. Value: baoUSD is in its infancy, but balancer has an opportunity to become the primary source of liquidity for it and future synthetics. The Bao protocol gained a lot of exposure during 2021, attracting up to $200m in liquidity with only a vision, and now the community lead project is launching its first products.

406,"# Summary

To date, Uniswap has four deployments: Ethereum, Abritrum, Optimism, and Polygon. In addition to these deployments, there are proposals to deploy Uniswap on Harmony, Celo, and more chains expected soon. The protocol should continue to deploy to new markets, but as the protocol continues to grow, it is vital the protocol learns to manage each of the deployments. With each new chain, there is new infrastructure that needs to be adapted to so that UNI on Ethereum can govern all of these deployments.

GFX Labs has been researching the various deployments and has prepared the first Uniswap cross-chain proposal to demonstrate how mainnet UNI can manage deployments on other chains.

Polygon has a messaging mechanism between Ethereum and Polygon called the [Fx-Portal](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/l1-l2-communication/fx-portal/). The portal functions via three contracts: FxRoot, State Sender, & FxChild. Messages can be sent from Ethereum to Polygon by calling the sendMessageToChild(address, bytes) at the FxRoot contract on Ethereum, which calls the State Sender contract. The [validators](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/validate/polygon-basics/who-is-validator/) monitor the State Sender contract and relay messages to the FxChild on Polygon. Upon successful relay to the FxChild, the message is executed on Polygon by the validators.

The owner of the Uniswap v3 contracts on Polygon is the [Ethereum Proxy contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8a1b966ac46f42275860f905dbc75efbfdc12374#code). The proxy contract will only process transactions that originate from the [Timelock contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc#code) on Ethereum and are delivered by the [FxChild](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8397259c983751daf40400790063935a11afa28a). Every governance proposal targeting a change on Polygon should set the [FxRoot](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe5e5d361b2ad62c541bab87c45a0b9b018389a2#code) on Ethereum as the target and send the message (parameter change) via the contract. The message passed through the FxRoot must contain the target(s) contract on Polygon, the function(s) to call, the call data(s), similar to the proposal system.

For the pilot of cross-chain governance, we are implementing the 1 basis point/1 tick fee tier on Polygon. The 1bp pools on Ethereum have been incredibly successful and increased Uniswap’s market share significantly since GFX Labs’ successful proposal in November 2021.

Because governance has already approved it on Ethereum, the content of this proposal should not be controversial and puts the focus on the research and implementation.

408,"## [ARFC-Addendum] Update Boosters for Merit Round 7
## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
## Date: 2024-07-25
---
### Simple Summary
We propose updating Merit parameters and rewarded actions to increase program efficiency for Round 7.

### Motivation
The Aave protocol has maintained and developed its market share in DeFi in a highly competitive landscape thanks to the Merit program. Recent rounds of Merit have been successful, and we aim to build upon this success while adapting to new strategies and market conditions.

Merit aims to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program. Therefore, it needs to be updated and adapted when new strategies can be applied.

### Specification

**Boosters Update**

1. Retain and Expand:
   Expansion of Second Degree Aligned Users Booster: This booster will reward users of Defisaver and **now also Gnosis Safe**, recognizing their importance in the broader DeFi ecosystem and encouraging their integration with Aave.

2. Remove:
   - ""Diversity supporter"" LST boost. This will be replaced by a dedicated boost for the Etherfi Aave market, allowing for more targeted incentives.
   - **GHO minting rewards in favor of StkGHO**. With the recent policy to tap the GHO borrow rate to match the MakerDAO DSR, the cost of minting GHO was decreased significantly, leading to a ""Net"" borrow rate below markets, especially for users also benefiting from the StkAAVE discount. This has made the maintenance of the peg of GHO more difficult as the carry trade opportunity has been seen as attractive for some users. We consider it more efficient to focus Merit on StkGHO for Round 7.


3. New Addition:
   - **Etherfi Aave Market Boost**: A new, dedicated boost will be created to support and incentivize participation in the Etherfi Aave market, recognizing its unique position in the ecosystem This expansion is contingent on Governance approval of its deployment

### Next Steps
1 escalate this [ARFC-Addendum] proposal to a Snapshot vote for formal approval.
2. If [ARFC Addendum] is approved in the Snapshot phase, apply changes to Merit Round 7.

### Disclaimer
The Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes ""Merit"" without external compensation.

**Summary:**
Proposal to add gauge support for the newly created BetSwirl [80/20 BETS/wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x26cc136e9b8fd65466f193a8e5710661ed9a98270002000000000000000005ad).

    • Other useful links? [Dune](https://dune.com/betswirl), [Token Terminal](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/betswirl), [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocol/betswirl)

**Protocol Description:**

BetSwirl aims to be the web3 casino where users owns a share of the house, and are rewarded a share of its revenue (30%) via the BETS token.
The historic price prior to the migration is shown on the initial [QuickSwap LP](https://dexscreener.com/polygon/0x76bba00e6d8b037821538f61963e6922e17c98a8) or on [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/betswirl) ([CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/betswirl/) update is pending).

**Motivation:**

Due to the Multichain issue, we've recently migrated to [BETS v2](https://etherscan.io/token/0x94025780a1ab58868d9b2dbbb775f44b32e8e6e5) (same contract address on Ethereum, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Avalanche and Polygon). And to address BETS v1 liquidity fragmentation (we had 4 LP on each chains), we migrated 100% of BetSwirl's Owned Extractable Liquidity (from Polygon, Arbitrum, BNB Chain and Avalanche) to this pool on Balancer Ethereum.

We'd like **Core Pool** incentives because the pool is paired with 20% wstETH (with a rate provider) and we are providing direct [ETH incentives on our 80BETS/20wstETH Staking pool](https://app.betswirl.com/staking?c=1&pool=0xaeaf7948c38973908ffa97c92f3384595d057135). A 2% capped gauge would be appropriate for now given our AUM.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** BetSwirl isn't in DAO mode yet, but we're investigating the ways to transition. BetSwirl's treasuries multi-sigs ([Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f72820ee00d54330F9Ba31ff6006116D7ddFE67), [Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf14C79a7fA22c1f97C779F573c9bF39b6b43381c), [Avalanche](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x1a75280F832280Af93f588f715a5Fb4Ca7918430), [BNB Chain](https://bscscan.com/address/0xCD25325a6eF20BC5dF9bceAc0cC22a48d2e8f6eF) and [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xfA695010bF9e757a1abCd2703259F419217aa756)) are owning all contracts (BETS, Bankrolls, Games, Dividends, Staking). [Signers from the core team](https://documentation.betswirl.com/whitepaper/team) are Romuald, Nato, Addy and GFK.

2. **Oracles:** Relying on Chainlink VRF for the games of chance.

3. **Audits:** https://github.com/BetSwirl/Smart-Contracts

4. **Centralization vectors:** The core team is responsible to dispatch the staking rewards.

5. **Market History:** BETS v1 TGE was [date=2022-03-15]. Volatility on BETS v1 was due to our liquidity being fragmented ($200k of extractable liquidity was dispatched across 4 chains on 50/50 pairs).

411,"**Title:** Aave Treasury Proposal: Onboard with Centrifuge Prime to invest in RWA

**Author:** @Khan 

**Date:** Sep 12, 2023

---

### **Summary**

This proposal brings on Centrifuge as a service provider to the Aave DAO to setup a legal structure to support RWA investments, develop RWA specific management and governance processes, and allocate $1M of the Aave Treasury’s stablecoin holdings to a liquid US T-Bill fund on Centrifuge, as a proof of concept investment.

This is a first step towards a long term effort for Aave to develop and launch an RWA Facilitator that will back GHO with Real World Assets. With this proposal Aave can earn yield on idle stablecoins, establish long-term RWA infrastructure for the protocol, and allow the Aave DAO to begin building internal familiarity and expertise in the RWA industry.

The proposal minimizes upfront cost and completely recoups the initial investment within 6-12mo and starts earning yield for Aave within the first 3mo. It locks up no long term capital and leaves the DAO in full control over the treasury allocation.

The main results of this proposal:
1. Aave will onboard to Centrifuge Prime to establish the legal and technical infrastructure for the Aave protocol to invest in RWAs.
1. Through Prime, the Aave Treasury will allocate $1M of USDC to the Anemoy LTF, a short-duration US treasury bill pool on Centrifuge.

### **Motivation**

Aave has long been a contributor and supporter of RWA initiatives. Since the first announcement of GHO, the Aave community has consistently expressed its interest in expanding into this area. Treasury Management at Aave has historically been focused on strategic crypto assets, ignoring the returns and liquidity available in offchain markets for various reasons.

Today, with roughly 17% of the treasury in stablecoins (~13m USD), the Aave DAO is overlooking the 5% available interest in the risk-free rate of overnight financing of US treasury assets. This can offer $250,000 of recurring revenue a year at just 5m USD of investment. These markets can immediately become some of the highest earning revenue streams for the DAO.

Beyond just economics, this proposal would allow the Aave DAO to establish and begin developing the internal RWA expertise necessary to engage with these markets. Centrifuge Prime is purpose-built for DeFi native organizations, offering the critical services and infrastructure necessary to onboard a diverse portfolio of RWA through a single interface.

Centrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWA on as collateral, and pioneered the first Aave deployment into RWA with the joint development of the RWA Market. Onboarding Aave to Centrifuge Prime for liquid investment strategies is an optimal approach for scaling RWA with the Aave community. It will develop the legal and technical infrastructure necessary to interface with RWAs safely and efficiently, while allowing the Aave community to get comfortable and familiar with the processes and thinking around RWA. This will put Aave in a significantly improved position to be able to leverage RWA collateral for GHO in the long term, either to improve liquidity or develop additional revenue streams.

### **Specification**

#### **Setting up the Aave DAO Legal Conduit**
This proposal instructs Centrifuge to initiate the setup of a legal structure for the benefit of the Aave DAO that will be ratified and deployed by a subsequent Aave token holder vote.

The process for establishing the legal framework is as follows: The Centrifuge contributor team will retain external legal counsel in the Cayman Islands to represent the Aave DAOs interests. The legal structure itself will be established per the previously discussed legal framework developed by Centrifuge. The defining documents and legal agreement team will be created to incorporate specific processes around the DAOs interaction with the foundation company. The results of this work will be presented to the Aave DAO, an analysis from the external counsel will be provided, and the community will have time to process, provide feedback, and otherwise request changes in the legal structure. The structure will only be implemented and executed with DAO approval, likely via Snapshot or other requisite process as requested by the community.

The legal structure will be integrated with DAO governance through a process defined in the legal documents, is capable of investing and holding assets on behalf of the DAO, and ultimately allow the Aave DAO full legal recourse to their investments. The legal counsel, while required under local Cayman law, is retained for the purposes of having an independent legal party to protect Aave’s interest.

The structure defines the actions the foundation can take, such as initiating investments or redemptions. Any action can be made only with approval from the DAO and providing a DAO approved “resolution” to the Foundation entity described above instructing the Foundation to act in accordance with the resolution. The specific details of this process will be developed alongside the Aave community.

This framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar structures 1. There, the same structure is used to support a >$1.2B debt ceiling, with >600m+ actively deployed.

More information on the fund, the legal framework, and the processes described here can be found in the [on going FAQ discussion here.](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)

#### **Initial pilot investment in Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund**

Once the legal structure has been defined and implemented, a specific DAO resolution will be presented to the DAO that instructs the Foundation to perform a 1M investment into the Anemoy LTF and transfers 1M USDC from the DAOs treasury into the Anemoy pool onchain.
Centrifuge will work with Aave to do an initial test investment and then a partial redemption to test out the complete rails.

#### **Scaling beyond the first transaction**

It is best for Aave to deploy into RWAs slowly. This proposal creates an initial deployment into the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund of $1M (pending DAO approval at the time investment). It is up to the community to initiate further investments, but we recommend keeping RWA allocations at a fixed cap of the overall Aave balance sheet until the community is more comfortable.

From there on, further investment and redemption actions are in full control of the Aave DAO. The process can easily be integrated to support portfolio and allocation decisions made through a more formal treasury management process, either manually or programmatically. Centrifuge is committed to supporting these efforts for the duration of this proposal’s stream.

Outside of US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the Aave DAO to allocate into the following asset classes in the future:

| Bucket| Description | Target Return | Liquidity
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Liquid | Lowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds| 5-6% | Daily
| Preservation | Investments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc. | 6-8% | 3-6 months
| Acceleration | Trade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets | 8-20% | 3-24mo |

#### **Summary Process**
In summary, the following process will be executed through this proposal:
1. Acquire Caymans Legal Counsel
1. Conduct initial legal research and analysis alongside counsel, share to forum
1. Post proposed legal documents and legal arrangement to forum, host community call, gather and implement community feedback. Arrangement will include explicit processes for management of the foundation company (i.e. investments and redemptions).
1. DAO approval of legal implementation
1. Foundation company onboards to Anemoy LTF
1. DAO proposal request for 1m of USDC investment into Anemoy LTF


**Estimated Timeline & Project Phases**


| Activity | Description | Est. Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Legal setup | Creation of Foundation Company, passing of DAO resolutions to start deployment into RWAs | 1-2 months
| Initial Deployment | DAO instructs Foundation to deploy $1M into a US Treasuries Fund and transfers $1M in USDC Stablecoins into the Anemoy LTF | 2-3mo
| Scaling up / Ongoing Operation | DAO can vote on increase allocation to Prime and direct investments towards a variety of liquid lower yielding and more longer term investments at any time | After 3mo

#### **Fees**
While there are some legal setup costs that have to be covered by the DAO upfront we limit these as much as possible.

Even at a conservative deployment of just $2M and a portfolio return equal to current US Treasury yields Aave should break-even within the first 6mo and start generating revenue for the DAO thereafter.

The legal work will be useful far beyond this initial proposal and can be the basis on which Aave onboards RWAs into GHO.

**Fees**
| Fee | Amount | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legal Setup | up to 50,000 USDC | To be paid immediately into a Safe controlled by Centrifuge to pay for lawyers and Cayman service providers to set up a Cayman foundation company to the benefit of the Aave DAO, any unused budget will be returned to the Aave treasury.
|Portfolio Fee | 0.35% p.a. on assets in Prime up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M | Paid on an ongoing basis to Centrifuge for maintaining the portfolio
|Aave Reward | 500 stkAave streamed over 2 years into the Centrifuge treasury, starting with the first 1M UDSC Deployment into Centrifuge Prime |To cover costs of resource and facilitation time for the development of the infrastructure and processes. Centrifuge DAO intends for this to create better alignment with strong skin in the game incentives for success.

413,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal, entitled the “Exploring New Frontiers: Bring ApeCoin ($Ape) into the Mobile Gaming World,” also known as AIP-xxx brings the utilities and values of ApeCoin to thousands of new holders through its integration into the Meta Merge game – a pet collection and mobile evolution game powered by AIGC and Ultiverse.

By integrating ApeCoin into the game, $Ape becomes another in-game asset in Meta Merge for new holders and game players to enjoy gamified experiences based on real-world utility. We aim to reinforce and leverage ApeCoin and its ecosystem by creating new user experiences through the power of the game. Thus, this integration will provide an ecosystem where players can utilize APE tokens within the game, alongside the other benefits they know APE tokens for.

#### OVERALL COST

NO funds are needed from ApeCoin DAO. Meta Merge will be responsible for the cost of smart contract deployment, testing and auditing, and other fees and resources associated with AIP-xxx. We request support from the ApeCoin Community for implementing this integration and will be responsible for updating all progress.

417,"## Rationale

This VIP proposes a new set of parameters for VAI based on this discussion 1.

## Summary

Increase the steepness of the interest rate curve of VAI to incentivize VAI close to $1.

## Motivation

- Harden the peg by making it expensive to borrow VAI when the VAI price is low.
- Provide a better rate for borrowers when VAI is at $1.

## Specification

Modification of this VIP:
- baseRate: 3% (from 4%)
- floatRate: 4000% (from 225%)

We provide an exemple of the implication of the changes in the forum post.

This VIP doesn’t enable VAI borrowings, this will be enabled in a following VIP contingent to having a significant healthy buffer in the VAI USDT PSM.

## Risk Analysis

- Reduction of earnings if VAI stays at $1
- Increasing the VAI borrow rate might reduce VAI borrowings and TVL

**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)


# Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.

# About Jarvis Network
Synthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.

jFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.

The protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.

We have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).

Combined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).

We also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.

jEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.

We debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.

The protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:

- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).
- $78M of volume on our primary market.
- 33k swaps by 9k users.
- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).
- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).
- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.
- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.

# Benefits for Aave V3
### Fiat on and off-ramp
jEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.

We have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).

Having jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.

### Large addressable market
A part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).

### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins
jEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.

### DDM
jEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.

### Low risk collateral
As collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.

jEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.

jEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.


# Risk Parameters
With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:

1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.

# Security specification and risks

### Risks inherent to jEUR
Besides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.

jEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.


[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)


### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.
jEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.

There is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.

It does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.

425,"The objective of this proposal is to share ideas on how we can do the following. 

1. Increase rewards for farmers
2. Increase the utility of staked CAKE
3. Increase the protocol revenue 
4. Reduce CAKE emissions
5. Get closer to ultrasound money

Every few weeks we vote to change the rewards for each farm, reducing some and increaing others.  This method should be scraped and replaced with a ""ve"" type voting gauge. 

Staked CAKE holders could then vote on how the CAKE rewards should be split between the farms. 
If a farm get 5% of the vote then they get 5% of the CAKE rewards. 

Once a vote deadline has been hit, them reward amounts are locked in for 2 weeks and then votes are recounted every 2 weeks. 

On top of the Gauge voting system we build a UI for bribes, where farmers and 3rd party protocols can offer a payment to staked CAKE holders in exchange for their votes. 

As the bribe UI builds up and the bribes start coming in, we can start reducing the CAKE emissions being paid to the staked CAKE holders.  Replacing CAKE emissions with income from other protocols. 
The reduction of emissions to the staked CAKE pool should be at a slow and steady rate of 1 CAKE per block per month until the rewards are 0 CAKE emissions. 

After the first reduction in emissions to the staked CAKE pool the protocol will redirect 5% of the trading fees (from the 0.01% and 0.05% farms) to rewarding the staked CAKE pool.  

To kickstart the system the rewards to farmers should be increased by 0.25 CAKE per block per month over a 6 month time frame, increasing the emissions by 1.5 CAKE per block.  Once the ecosystem is up and running we can look at reducing these emissions. 



The expected outcome.

1. Emissions reduced by 0.75 CAKE per block a month with a total reduction of 5.15 CAKE per block after 7 months. a 55% reduction in emissions. 
2. Staked CAKE holders rewards switch from emissions to bribes + trading fees, avoiding a massive overnight cut in rewards. 
3. Farmers see an steady increase in the overall rewards allocated to farming. 
4. 3rd party protocols have the option to buy voting power with bribes, which should increase the liquidity in their farms. 
5. 3rd party protocols now have a reason to buy and hold staked CAKE so they can vote for their own liquidity pools. 
6. Staked CAKE voting power has an increased value,",neutral

428,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/2110/17).


## Simple Summary
The partnership aims to align the interests of GnosisDAO and BalancerDAO, by increasing the collaboration between both organizations. The technical teams of both DAOs would carry out developments in the best interest of both organizations, such as completing [Stage 3](https://medium.com/@gnosisPM/cowswap-upgrades-to-final-version-by-fully-integrating-with-balancer-v2-21f4d635da1#:~:text=and%20better%20UX.-,Stage%203%20(Soon),-Balancer%2DGnosis%2DProtocol) of the Balancer-Gnosis-Protocol integration, so that Balancer users are able to place trades in GPv2 via their UI. Traders on Balancer would then always get the best prices available on-chain -or better- if CoWs are found, eventually leading to better prices for all traders of CowSwap as trades are batched and a higher trade frequency leads to increased chances for coincidence of wants.

Also, joint marketing efforts will be made, together with a token swap, to align governance interests.

## Abstract
Even though GnosisDAO and BalancerDAO have common interests, their current level of collaboration and integration isn’t enough to achieve their common goals. A partnership agreement would be necessary to increase the depth and breadth of their joint efforts, improving coordination and resource allocation to common projects.

This improvement proposal has already passed phase 1 in both protocols:
https://forum.gnosis.io/t/treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/1440
https://balancergrants.notion.site/DAO-Agreement-Process-a871f46c41f043fd83bce34007eb14ab

## Motivation
We believe that achieving a greater synergy between BalancerDAO and GnosisDAO would significantly strengthen both organizations, allowing for a more efficient planning and execution of their joint projects, backed up by healthier treasuries, with increased token diversification.

## Specification
Both parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following towards this partnership:

**Technical**
Joint work of technical teams of both DAOs to carry out developments in the best interest of both DAOs, such as completing Stage 3 of the Balancer-Gnosis-Protocol integration, so that Balancer users are able to place trades in GPv2 via their UI. Traders on Balancer will then always get the best prices available on-chain -or better- if CoWs are found. This will eventually lead to better prices for all traders of CowSwap as trades are batched and a higher trade frequency leads to increased chances for coincidence of wants.

**Marketing**
To ensure both entities will profit from each other's reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where useful.

**Token Transaction**
To align governance interests, a Token Swap between the two organizations is initiated as part of this agreement.

200,000 BAL from the Ecosystem Fund would be exchanged for the equivalent USD value of GNO in equal proportions from DAO Treasury, using the 90 day smooth moving average price at the time that voting ends.

Both organizations commit to holding the received assets for a period of at least 1 year. No on-chain logic will be implemented to ensure this.

## Rationale
Gnosis and Balancer have worked together for the past years. The protocols have [integrated Cowswap with Balancer V2](https://medium.com/@gnosisPM/cowswap-upgrades-to-final-version-by-fully-integrating-with-balancer-v2-21f4d635da1) to enable better gas prices and UX, MEV protection, no gas fees for failed transactions, better prices due to the optimized pool settlements and use of the Balancer v2 single vault architecture.

**Partnership Term**
The Partnership is open-ended and does not have an expiry date.

**Partnership Governance**
The partnership is managed by representatives of the organizations directed by the respective governance processes of the organizations. In the case of this partnership, there are 2 representatives for each organization.

**Exit Clause**
Both organizations can at any moment terminate the agreement through their respective governance systems.

**Communications around the Partnership**
- A Partnership announcement blog will be created within the 2 weeks following the agreement date.

- To ensure operational effectiveness, a monthly call will be set up with at least one representative of each entity

Both DAOs acknowledge that DAO agreements are inherently unpredictable and irreversible and agree to this initial partnership agreement.

## Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) would initiate a transaction to send 200,000 BAL to GnosisDAO (0x849d52316331967b6ff1198e5e32a0eb168d039d)

429,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. 

In addition, this ARC proposes adjusting two (2) total risk parameters, including LTV and Liquidation Threshold, across one (1) Aave Arc (Fireblocks) asset.

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Following the recent market crash, our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for LINK and WETH.** 

These parameter updates also represent Gauntlet's first set of parameter updates for the Aave Arc market.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification

Our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. 


| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| LINK Loan To Value     | 70%     | 67%     |
| LINK Liquidation Bonus    | 6.3%     | 5.0%     |
| **LINK Liquidation Threshold**     | 78%     | ***75%***     |
| WBTC Loan To Value     | 70%     | 69%     |
| WBTC Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 5.0%     |
| WBTC Liquidation Threshold     | 75%     | 76%     |
| WETH Loan To Value     | 82.5%     | 81%     |
| WETH Liquidation Bonus    | 5.0%     | 4.0%     |
| **WETH Liquidation Threshold**     | 85%     | ***83%***     |



See below volatility and exchange volume data from 05/13 to 05/26. These are valuable metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. 

|Symbol| 05-26 Volatility| 05-13 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |

## Aave Arc (Fireblocks) Parameter Changes Specification

Our simulation platform indicates that increasing the capital efficiency of USDC collateral does not meaningfully increase the risk of insolvencies. Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| USDC Loan To Value     | 85.5%     | 87.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Threshold     | 88%     | 90%     |




## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

Chaos Labs proposes to renew our engagement with the Aave DAO, providing our full suite of risk management products and services, covering all of Aave, including V2, V3, and GHO, across all current and future deployments.

Our current annual engagement is set to end on November 7th, 2023.

# Background

In November 2022, Chaos formally joined the Aave DAO as a service provider specializing in risk management and parameter optimization. This partnership began with our original [engagement to cover V3 markets](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025), followed by an [extension to cover V2 markets formally](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/139/), with an additional [engagement amendment](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-scope-and-compensation-amendment/14407) approved by the community in August 2023 to adjust the scope and compensation for the remainder of the original term. 

During this time, we have consistently demonstrated our unwavering dedication to the DAO, covering all aspects of the protocol across all deployments and providing the community with proactive risk parameter recommendations alongside reactive analyses and risk-mitigating strategies in light of significant market events. Chaos has initiated over 60 ARFCs and supported nearly 100 additional proposals and community discussions, including parameter optimization, onboarding of new assets and new deployments, deprecation of V2 and migration to V3, GHO launch, and community support during major market events.

During our engagement, the protocol incurred minimal bad debt while facing major market events, namely the USDC depeg in early March 2023.

# Proposal

Chaos Labs offers our comprehensive risk management and optimization platform for Aave, covering the entire spectrum of Aave, including V2, V3, and GHO, across all current and future deployments.

Our strategies aim to secure protocol assets against market volatility, black swan events, liquidity attacks, and market manipulation. Our methodologies are rooted in an integrative approach, offering protocol robustness and protecting funds from market risks through dynamic risk parameter recommendations. We provide a holistic approach encompassing software and services to mitigate risks in volatile markets, countering economic attacks on the protocol and ensuring the secure preservation of user funds.

## Scope

### **Risk Parameter Optimization**

Deploying our custom agent-based simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a distinguished team of data scientists and researchers, we provide the community with comprehensive analyses and recommendations for risk parameter settings and strategies. Our paramount goal is to optimize protocol revenue while protecting user funds and mitigating potential risk vectors. Chaos Labs will thoroughly analyze the ecosystem and build custom agent-based simulations. These simulations leverage protocol dynamics and on-chain behaviors to pressure test and optimize the protocol, identifying potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement. Thorough system analysis yields a comprehensive understanding of the factors that impact protocol health and stability, enabling us to make data-driven optimization and risk management recommendations. 

Coverage includes support for all Aave risk parameters, including Liquidation Thresholds, LTV, Liquidation Bonus, Supply and Borrow Caps, Debt Ceilings, and Interest Rate Curves.

**Parameter Recommendation Platform**

The Chaos Labs Parameter Recommendation Portal is designed to provide the Aave community with a comprehensive understanding of the simulation outputs and underlying data to optimize risk parameter settings. By providing a clear and intuitive interface that highlights the impact of different parameter settings on risk and return, we can foster a more informed and engaged community, facilitating ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing. 

In addition to presenting the data outputs from the Chaos Simulation Engine, the Parameter Recommendation Portal offers users unparalleled access to the underlying simulation mechanics and implications, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the simulations and their results.

### **Risk Monitoring and Alerting**

We offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations. Users can drill into specific scenarios in which the protocol could be negatively impacted and receive alerts concerning significant changes to on-chain activities that could pose a risk or detriment to the protocol's health. 

As part of our commitment to delivering a world-class risk management solution for the DeFi ecosystem, we constantly iterate and improve on the platform with additional features and enhancements. The Aave community will continue to gain access to the newest feature additions and enhancements continuously, allowing users to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions while optimizing their overall portfolio performance.

### Deprecation of V2 and Migration to V3

Chaos Labs has spearheaded several community initiatives to deprecate the V2 markets and facilitate the transition to V3, as outlined in the 'Background' section. 

As we progress with the deprecation plan and migration efforts, we are committed to continue allocating resources and offering the community recommendations for proactively adjusting V2 parameters. This includes updates to Liquidation Thresholds, Reserve Factors and enhancing the capital efficiency of V3 markets to ensure a seamless migration of positions from V2. 

Given the extended nature of the transition to V3, it remains imperative to uphold proactive risk management for V2 during this transitional phase.

### **Protocol Growth**

Chaos Labs will provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.

As we onboard new assets and deployments, the Chaos team will seamlessly integrate them into our systems to facilitate continuous monitoring and parameter optimization. We uphold the same high standard for all assets and deployments, ensuring consistency and excellence across the board. Our goal is to provide unwavering support for the protocol's expansion and sustainability.

### GHO

Following the initial launch of GHO, Chaos Labs is committed to the continued growth and safety of the stablecoin and will provide ongoing support, including:

- **Parameter Optimization** - we will conduct data-driven research and simulations to recommend optimizations for GHO-specific parameters, including Borrow rate, stkAAVE discount rate, bucket capacities, GSM, and DEX liquidity goals. Additionally, Chaos Labs will extend its current V3 Ethereum Asset Listing framework to include rigorous analysis of how new asset types can affect GHO composition and stability.
- **Ongoing Risk Management, Monitoring, and Analytics -** We will continue iterations on our unified risk monitoring and alerting platform for GHO across primary markets (Aave), including all facilitators and secondary markets (centralized and decentralized exchanges). Our risk management services include economic reviews of GHO and ecosystem adoption across primary and secondary markets, peg stability, GHO backing composition, and more.
- **Facilitator's Risk Framework, Recommendations, and Monitoring** - we will create a risk framework to consider potential facilitators and their corresponding GHO credit lines and provide ongoing risk analysis for potential and existing facilitators based on this framework.
- **And more**

### Chaos Team Support

As part of our services, we assign a dedicated protocol manager supported by our world-class team of researchers and data scientists to lead all risk-related communications and inquiries with the Aave community.

Our team support typically covers two main areas: ongoing management and incident response. In the event of any incidents or issues, our team will be on hand to provide timely and effective incident response, minimizing the potential impact on the protocol and its users.

**Ongoing and Proactive Risk Management**

This includes detailed analyses of new asset onboarding, assessing the potential risks and benefits of launching in new markets and providing a thorough understanding of parameter recommendations, including qualitative data and position analysis. 

**Incident Response**

 This includes supporting various events, including liquidity changes, asset depegs, price volatilities, etc. Our team provides ongoing support in these events, including market monitoring and alerting, ad-hoc risk analysis, and recommendations on risk-mitigating actions.

Our team of experts brings a wealth of experience in risk management and data analysis, enabling us to provide the insights and recommendations necessary to navigate even the most challenging market conditions. By working closely with the community, we can provide the support and guidance necessary to promote Aave’s long-term success and sustainability.

## Communications:

- Our team will share our recommendations and analyses through dedicated governance forum discussions, maintaining transparency and facilitating effective communication with the community.
- We commit to providing a monthly update post, highlighting completed work and outlining our future areas of focus.
- We are consistently available for community calls and regularly schedule check-up calls with Aave delegates. These calls primarily focus on addressing risk-related inquiries, offering insights into existing proposals, and gathering general feedback.

## Terms

- 12-month engagement, November 13th 2023-November 13th, 2024
- $1.6M, streamed linearly throughout the engagement.
    - Given community preference, we suggest the full amount to be paid in GHO but are open to any composition of stables/AAVE tokens.

## Specification:

If this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (`0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0`) as the recipient.

In terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 1,600,000 aUSDC or GHO for a 12-month duration.

## Disclaimer:

Chaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and Tashi. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.

This proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.

# Next steps

1. Following community feedback, we are targeting a Snapshot vote on November 1st, 2023.
2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) on November 8th, 2023.

436,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-authorize-treasury-subdao-to-allocate-bal-to-turbo/2549).

# Motivation

Recently, Fei Labs announced [Tribe Turbo](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/the-tribe-dao-strongly-believes-that-a-healthy-and-thriving-defi-ecosystem-needs-a-robust-platform-b1faea700dfa), a way for DAO’s to issue Fei at no cost into Fuse pools of their choice. The Treasury subDAO has been evaluating this opportunity and believes there is likely market demand for users to borrow against their BPT’s (Balancer Pool Tokens) while still earning any BAL or other token incentives. Credit to Jared for preparing this helpful infographic which illustrates what will take place.

As part of the recent treasury swap with Fei, Balancer DAO has 2.45M FEI. As an initial allocation to gauge market demand, we propose to deposit 100k BAL into Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]) and borrow up to 10% of the current market value in FEI - we will also add 1M FEI from our current holdings for a total of ~1.1 - 1.2M FEI to be deposited into Fuse Pool [y].

The Treasury subDAO will monitor the health of the FEI loan against our 100k BAL and either add more BAL collateral or pay down the debt using our existing FEI holdings to protect against any possibility of liquidation.

The initial list of BPT’s users can deposit into Fuse Pool [y] will be wstETH/WETH, WBTC/WETH, WETH/DAI, WETH/BAL, WBTC/renBTC/sBTC, FEI/WETH, bbfUSD (Fuse boosted pool DAI/FEI/LUSD), and bbaUSD (Aave Boosted Pool DAI/USDC/USDT). As previously mentioned, any liquidity mining incentives will still be captured so users do not miss out on any yield by using Fuse Pool [y].

Since Tribe DAO has a lot of experience managing Fuse pools, the Treasury subDAO will let them manage Fuse Pool [y]. However, the Treasury subDAO will retain decision making authority around adding/removing BPT’s and setting the maximum LTV for each BPT. Any decision would be given to Tribe DAO to execute.

An important final consideration is that any FEI borrowed through Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]) is subject to an 80/20 split of the borrow interest with 80% going to Tribe DAO and 20% to Balancer DAO. Treasury subDAO has provided feedback that a 50/50 split would make increased usage of Turbo more palatable, though for now the 80/20 split remains the most likely reality. Credit to Jared again for this comparison of both revenue scenarios.

# KPI

Treasury subDAO is targetting a minimum of 50% utilization on borrowable FEI in Fuse Pool [y] as a sign that market demand does exist for borrowing against BPT collateral. This metric will be assessed 30 days after our deposit into Turbo to show either this is a worthwhile allocation of capital or we need to reconsider the value add. 

# Risks

* Turbo is a new product that, while audited, is untested. There is the possibility of a smart contract bug which causes a complete loss of our BAL deposited as collateral to Fuse Pool [x].
  * **Mitigation**: Tribe DAO has offered to give us an OTC insurance quote. This can be pursued if the Treasury subDAO feels it is appropriate.

* If utilization of FEI is very high in Fuse Pool [y] and the price of BAL drops very quickly, it may not be possible to withdraw FEI from Fuse Pool [y] to re-pay the FEI we borrowed from Fuse Pool [x]. This scenario could result in liquidation of the BAL we deposited to Fuse Pool [x].
  * **Mitigation**: Treasury subDAO should be prepared to add additional BAL collateral and/or use other liquid cash-equivalent assets in Balancer DAO’s treasury like USDC or FEI to re-pay the Fuse Pool [x] loan in an emergency. Additionally, it may take several days for the DAO Multisig to execute the necessary transaction(s) which must be factored in.
* Tribe DAO calls the loan in Fuse Pool [x]. This would trigger a four week period where Balancer DAO must repay the FEI we borrowed in full or risk the BAL collateral being seized.
  * **Mitigation**: Similar to the previous one. We cannot rely on being able to withdraw FEI from Fuse Pool [y] in such an emergency, so keeping cash-equivalent liquid assets ready to use in this kind of situation is important.
* Manipulation of the oracle that prices BPT in Fuse Pool [y]. This could result in an exploit that drains funds from Fuse Pool [y].
  * **Mitigation**: BPTs represent full range liquidity - previous instances of this manipulation in Fuse pools has been the result of relying on a Uniswap V3 oracle which represents concentrated liquidity in a specific range. Thus, the risk of this exploit should be very low. If it happens, we might lose the FEI we deposited to Fuse Pool [y] so we’d need to repay our FEI loan using our own funds.

# Specification

The Treasury subDAO already has the authority to farm with idle non-BAL assets, so only a social vote of the subDAO signers is required to allocate FEI from our current holdings into Fuse Pool [y]. In order to make use of Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]), we require authorization from BAL token holders to use some of the DAO’s BAL holdings.

**The Treasury subDAO requests that governance delegate us the power to allocate up to 500,000 BAL to Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]).** This will allow us to scale up from the initial deposit of 100,000 BAL if we deem it appropriate.

437,"This temperature check will gauge delegates' interest/support for deploying the onboarding package to Polygon zkEVM.

I've attached the forum thread for the full context.

**TLDR**: The Uniswap Onboarding Package is for new deployments of Uniswap v3 to get set up with three-month liquidity incentives, a frontend (Oku), and incentives distribution tooling (Angle Merkl). These resources will help position Uniswap to have a formidable presence on new EVM chains.

**How the vote works**:
The temperature check will be considered met as long as the total number of votes cast for the funding options is over >10M. If there isn't a clear winner for which level of incentives the chain should receive, a discussion can be had before the onchain proposal.

**Notes**:
* Applies to recent deployments of Uniswap v3 where delegates vote for them
* Pools will be primarily blue chips (ETH-USDC, ETH/WBTC, USDC-USDT) and a local pool if applicable. The onchain vote will include the final details for pool info.
* The Accountability Committee will escrow the inflight incentives.
* Oku will only be paid for new deployments, not existing ones or ones already contracted. Oku prices all standard deployments at $45k for the initial integration and $5k/month for 12 months.
* Angle Merkl will only be paid their integration fee for new deployments. For new deployments and new chains, Merkl is €20k. For existing chains, new Uni v3 deployments are €10k.
* Angle Merkl charges 3% on incentives distributed with their system. They have offered a 25% discount on their base 3% fee for incentives distributed between $2.5m-$5m, a 50% discount on incentives distributed between $5m-$10m, and a 75% discount on all incentives above $10m in a 365-day period.",neutral

439,"I would like to suggest a cake farming game that requires owning a pancake squard. 

# How it works
Each pancake Squard will have a level and the higher the level the more cake it will farm. To level the pancake Squad you will need to feed it cake and you can under/over feed it for faster xp or saving as much cake as you can. You can only feed the squard once every 8 hours. 

Over feeding the squard will cost 2 cake, under feeding will cost 0.5 cake and normal feeding will cost 1 Cake. To keep the farming balance feeding cake to the squad will be permanently burnt and in return it will offer higher apy of cake (potentially better than 365 days locked). The main advantage with this farming is that cake will be collectable daily unlike locked cakes that have to wait until term ends.

Having burn > mint (ie deflation of supply) is the only legitimate path forward if the intent is for the price to head north ^^^^^^^^^^^. Yes the pool APR has been steadily declining but its not a net decrease in mint volume, those newly minted CAKE just get moved to other areas. We need to actually decrease the net mint.

# Abstract

In [BIP-598](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-598-claim-extra-safe-airdrop/5723/1), we proposed claiming 119,196.47 SAFE tokens, which increased the Balancer DAO Treasury balance to 124,374.16 SAFE (valued at $228k at the time of writing). These SAFE tokens were claimable due to GNO generated through the GnosisDAO <> Balancer DAO [token swap agreement](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x8d4969e56fa8eb13abc7a3404b3d42fe6b4afa1c7f29111bd012314f093a2fd2). The GNO was subsequently locked into the LGNO locking contract, following a suggestion made by Karpatkey at that time.

Similarly, for the current proposal we suggest locking the SAFE balance in the [Balancer DAO multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f)  into a reward booster created by SAFE.

This is a locking mechanism built by [Safe {pass}](https://safe.global/pass) that will earn more points the sooner the SAFE is locked, and the longer it’s locked for.  With a declining multiplier, season 1 of this reward mechanism ends September 30th.

 
![lock-chart.png](ipfs://bafkreif5gkjgzu7a6a4u32zqqivvntij4e4b6tuvmk7ace3krboaqarwtm)
    

Rewards based on the point structure is yet to be defined by the Safe team, but could consist of:


* Sponsored transactions: ability to send a limited amount of free transactions.
* SAFE tokens: earn yield on locked SAFE. 

For the current balance of SAFE in the Balancer DAO multisig, the rewards multiplier [is at 1.90x](https://app.safe.global/apps/open?safe=eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f&appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.safe.global).

 
![timelock.png](ipfs://bafkreigcx5capjcdpoawpsexmevhw5x3jfey4rnm2oojif7ryd6kgispvi)
    

Regarding potential risks, we don't foresee a greater impact in locking the tokens compared to holding SAFE idle in the DAO multisig.

Recently, AlphaGrowth has agreed to facilitate the OTC transaction via wintermute.

This proposal seeks guidance from the community on moving forwards with swapping and transferring the ETHW. Given community support, we will swap to either USDC or ETH and pay out a 10% white-hat bounty to Arr00. The remaining 90% of funds will be sent to the Compound DAO multisig.

    Based on Michael Egorov's proposal, published on Novermer 5th 2023,  the main aim is to deploy Venus Protocol on the Ethereum Mainnet. This decision is driven by the fact that Ethereum has the highest liquidity and capital deployed, making it a favorable platform for on-chain trades. 

Furthermore, the proposal suggests listing Curve tokens, crvUSD and CRV, as collaterals on Ethereum, along with proposing CRV/XVS rewards for the benefit of the Venus community, Curve ecosystem, and Ethereum as a whole. 

The rationale behind this proposal is threefold. Firstly, the Ethereum Mainnet requires more lending protocols, and the presence of Venus would help to fill this gap. 

Secondly, deploying Venus on the Ethereum Mainnet would create visibility and brand awareness for the protocol. 

Lastly, Curve, being a leading AMM with a stablecoin (crvUSD) that maintains a close peg, aims to be present in all lending protocols and enhance adoption for crvUSD. 

The proposal also outlines the details for the core pool on Venus, isolated pools on Venus, liquidity mining incentive for crvUSD suppliers, and the creation of pools on Curve. The plan includes setting supply and borrow caps for different assets, such as crvUSD, CRV, and other stablecoins, as well as incentivizing liquidity providers with CRV rewards. 

Additionally, the proposal suggests creating various pools on Curve, such as VAI/crvUSD, XVS/crvUSD, and XVS/VAI on the Ethereum Mainnet. The aim is to help Venus assets find liquidity and facilitate the creation of these pools on BSC once Curve is deployed there. 

Finally, the proposal highlights the importance of obtaining a gauge for the curve pool, which would allow liquidity providers to receive CRV tokens as rewards. This gauge would require a positive vote from Curve Dao, and owning veCRV or other veCRV liquid tokens would grant voting rights. 

Overall, the proposal aims to deploy Venus on the Ethereum Mainnet, list Curve tokens, incentivize liquidity providers, and collaborate with Curve to create pools that benefit the Venus community, Curve ecosystem, and the broader Ethereum network.",bearish
447,"I hope PanCakeSwap will understand current market situation. Which is very changed now it will not work old style burning system by send token in dead address. Where Ether have started auto burning from total supply and now BNB following that too. Which maked the hype in price now their holders know by just holding price will increas.

That's what made the BTC successful project because by holding BTC, ETH, BNB supply is decreasing from total supply. But on the other side, Cake supply is increasing just by holding cake value is decrease. 

I know cake is controlling that supply and burning Cake by sending on dead address but still people look at total supply is over 500 million and it's increasing in the future. Which is making bad impact on value of cake.

So we want to make Cake V3 Smart which should decrease supply from total supply like BTC, ETH and now BNB. Sending on dead wallet is no longer a good idea.

Like if cake had this feature like BTC (Burning from total supply) now the cake total supply was over 240M estimated. Which sounds more satisfied than 500M.

So cake should become more like BTC.

Also, if cake giving rights to community for vote, then cake should also accept proposal.

    • Discord: https://discord.com/invite/planetarium
    • Twitter: https://twitter.com/NineChronicles

**Protocol Description:**

> Nine Chronicles is a fully decentralized free-to-play RPG, based on Scandinavian mythology, and the first title to be developed with Libplanet (https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet). Nine Chronicles runs on a P2P network of players without requiring any central server to host. The entire game, from crafting an item to complex battles, takes place fully on-chain.
>
> The first alpha test of Nine Chronicles started in 2019 Q2, and the mainnet was launched in 2020 Q4. Currently Nine Chronicles community is comprised of players from more than 100 countries. As Nine Chronicles is fully open source, there are a number of modded game clients developed by community members.
>
>Nine Chronicles Gold (NCG) is the in-game currency on its own blockchain network and it can be bridged to Ethereum mainnet. WNCG is the wrapped version of NCG. Nine Chronicles players can acquire NCG in various way including getting in the high ranks in Arena, selling an item, and running a node. Here is [the 2022 roadmap of Nine Chronicles](https://ninechronicles.medium.com/2022-nine-chronicles-roadmap-is-here-df3d2b8e6e0d) and WNCG price history can be viewed on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-ncg).

**Motivation:**

> Balancer’s weighted pool would help attract more liquidity with less impermanent loss comparing to 50/50 pool. Furthermore, adding the veBAL gauge will give bigger incentives to Nine Chronicles community members to deposit their tokens into Balancer pool, and will give deeper liquidity that would attract more users to trade on Balancer.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** The game protocol and Ethereum bridge is currently managed by multisig. The codes are fully open-source ([Nine Chronicles](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles), [NineChronicles.EthBridge](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles.EthBridge)) and the operations are fully shared and discussed in Discord.

2. **Oracles:** As the game and bridge are not using external information, the systems don’t rely on oracles. 

3. **Audits:** Here are the security [audit reports](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles.EthBridge/tree/main/docs) by Theori (won DEFCON CTF 5 times) and Certik for the Ethereum bridge.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Governance systems are yet to be fully decentralized and treasury functions are managed by multisig. The bridge is operated by using own Ethereum node adding to Infura.

5. **Market History:** As there is no DeFi protocol using WNCG, relevant events such as smart contract attacks or liquidations haven’t happened. There has been the Sushiswap pool for WNCG/ETH since MISO IDO in August 2021.

Uniswap Foundation: Preamble
Uniswap has already changed the world.

In only 3 years, the world’s first automated market maker has pioneered DeFi primitives, supported more than $1T 7 in cumulative volume, and served millions of users 4 worldwide. Its daily volume today is on par with Coinbase 10.

Ownership of the protocol was transferred to the community 12 in 2020 and since then the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) has demonstrated the potential for community-funded initiatives to make a positive impact. Over 1.5 years, UGP has funded 120+ grantees 22 improving governance, and developing new interfaces and developer tooling.

However, there is still work to do to help Uniswap reach its full potential. The governance process has too much friction, the ecosystem is too difficult to navigate, and UGP in its current form is not able to fund the most ambitious and impactful projects.

We want to change that.

Today, we are excited to propose the creation of the Uniswap Foundation, which has the mission to support the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem and community.

In other words, the goal of the Uniswap Foundation is to support you.

Uniswap’s community is expansive, encompassing the universe of individuals and organizations which build on and benefit from decentralized protocols. Your contributions have already made Uniswap a success, but we want to help you accomplish much more.

The Uniswap Foundation (UF) will provide grants to builders, researchers, organizers, academics, analysts, and more to grow the Protocol and plan for its future.

It will make it easier to govern the protocol and community treasury, and to navigate the broader ecosystem.

It will help you make an impact – to reduce friction, and amplify your efforts.

We believe that Uniswap will be the value exchange layer of the Internet.

It brought the automated market maker to the masses.

It has led the way in the evolution and growth of DeFi and web3.

It is censorship resistant, permissionless, decentralized, and secure – constituting a set of properties which we believe should define our world’s financial infrastructure.

But there is still a long way to go for Uniswap to reach its full potential.

We’re excited to work with all of you to make that happen.

If you’re excited too, please read our proposal, comment, reach out to chat (our DMs - @devinawalsh and @nkennethk are open!), and spread the word.

Uniswap Foundation Proposal
This proposal is being put forth by the Uniswap Foundation, a Delaware corporation formed by Uniswap community members Devin Walsh and Ken Ng to facilitate the steps outlined in this proposal.

TL;DR
Today, we are thrilled to propose the creation of the Uniswap Foundation (UF).
Scope: The UF, the first Foundation of a major protocol to go through the community governance process, will support the Protocol’s decentralized growth, reinvigorate governance, and serve as a Protocol advocate.
Team: Devin Walsh will serve as the Executive Director, Ken Ng will serve as Head of Operations, and they will build out a team of 12.
Budget: To fund these efforts, we are requesting:
A $14M Operating budget to cover a full team for 3 years
A $60M expanded Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) budget to cover 3+ years
We are requesting $74M total, which will be broken into two disbursements, with a first disbursement of $20M.
Governance Participation: We are also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance, primarily through delegation. Through usage of a new smart contract primitive The Franchiser 40, this UNI will be revocable by the DAO at any time, and cannot be used for any purpose outside of governance.
Uniswap Foundation
Mission
In pursuit of a more open and fair financial system, the Uniswap Foundation supports the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem.

Key Activities and OKRs
We have listed our starting OKRs below. It’s possible these OKRs will have to change in the future. If they do change in a meaningful way, we will communicate that to the community.

Team
Devin Walsh 108, Executive Director (ED)

As ED, Devin will be responsible for setting UF’s strategic vision alongside the Board and driving execution to achieve that vision.

Devin has been in crypto since 2016. She has conducted independent research for MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, worked on decentralized identity at uPort (ConsenSys), and led protocol and venture investments at CoinFund. She has consulted with Edge & Node and cLabs, and led MIRA, a seed stage startup at the intersection of fine art and NFTs. She recently resigned as Chief of Staff at Uniswap Labs in order to propose the creation of the UF.

Ken Ng 69, Head of Operations

As Head of Operations, Ken will build and scale processes to maximize the UF’s impact.

Ken has served the Uniswap ecosystem as Lead of the Uniswap Grants Program 1 for the past 1.5 years. He has helped run the Ethereum Foundation Ecosystem Support Program, which gave Hayden his initial grant 7 to build Uniswap. He served as COO of Slingshot Finance and cofounder of his nonprofit eduDAO, which helps raise funds for students and teachers in the Bronx.

The needs, and thus the makeup, of our team may change over time. However, today we aim to hire for following roles, with a focus on filling the Grants and Governance roles first:

 
![Team.png](ipfs://bafkreib2uwfespzdr3p2c4tdcpi3ndznqjig55edrigkrfcgq2zqjdtn6y)
    

Applications are open today! Check out job descriptions here.

As noted by Other Internet 4, there is also a need for new structures to “facilitate coordination across the complex web of stakeholders” within the Uniswap ecosystem. To provide this much needed coordination, the UF will be committed to working with a variety of independent parties (freelancers, development teams, research fellows, analysts, and more) to achieve many of its objectives.

Advisors
The Foundation’s initial advisory team will be made up of the following individuals:

Jesse Walden, Founder and GP, Variant
Julia Rosenberg, Co-Founder, Orca Protocol
Alexis Gauba, Co-Founder, Opyn; Co-Founder, she256
Hart Lambur, Co-Founder of UMA
In addition to advising UF on strategy and roadmap, this group will, alongside the Executive Director (ED) and Head of Operations,

Provide input on UF’s initial hiring decisions. This may include interviewing potential candidates and sharing feedback with the Committee as it determines its first hires, including its third Board member and at least next three team members.
Become temporary signers of the UF multi-sig, which will hold UF funds if and when the proposal is passed, for the sole purpose of executing approved proposals as instructed. This responsibility will be transitioned to UF team members once they are hired.
Board
Devin Walsh and Ken Ng will serve as the first two Board members of the UF. Alongside the UF’s Advisors, they will interview and target to hire a third Board member in the first 3 months of operations.

Budget
We are requesting $74M in UNI. This funding would be broken down into the following buckets:

$60M for Uniswap Grants Program
Grants spending will be broken down into the below categories. We will revisit and readjust these categories as needed to ensure we continue to deploy resources where they are most impactful.

We are proud of the work done by UGP thus far (memorialized in this retrospective 22), and are incredibly excited to expand the scope of its work.

 
![Grants.png](ipfs://bafkreibtxk4n6pjqrccg2weocvjnqpoeuceje2sagxbgokqucfjombefjy)
    

We are already in the process of assessing several high impact grant proposals which UGP would be excited to fund, if and when this proposal is passed. Two examples are:

A version of Uniswap v3 written in Cairo, to be deployed on Starknet
A prototype of an MEV estimation tool leveraging machine learning techniques built by respected academics in the space
We are also excited to continue funding ongoing work by existing grantees funded by UGP v0.1, including governance experiments and analyses from Other Internet, customer support from Serv.eth, and ETHGlobal hackathons.

To ensure community alignment with larger grants disbursements, the UF will put forth an off-chain Snapshot to the community for proposed grants larger than $2M.

We believe that this Grants budget will last approximately 3 years but this is subject to change depending upon the number and quality of applicants. We plan to approach the Treasury for additional Grants funds when there are ~6 months of funds remaining.

$14M operating budget to build out a full team of 12 over the next two years.
In order to provide stability to our employees and to sustain the Foundation, we may make a request to the community for additional funding for further out than 3 years when we return to the Treasury at 6-12 months of operations (read more below).

Budget estimate looking forward three years is below.
 
![Budget.png](ipfs://bafkreiel3fzdoeharssfyzclubtlyk667p5skcnwkfinrus7b6za5tiuwi)
    

*Inclusive of UNI vesting. In order to incentivize a highly qualified team, the UF will offer competitive compensation packages including both fiat and long-term vesting UNI. To provide full transparency, we will disclose UF financials later this year.

**The UF will allocate an additional $2M in funds to cover legal fees in the case of unexpected future litigation.

Fund Disbursements
An approval of this proposal is an approval for the full $74M budget requested.

We are requesting the funds in two disbursements:

$20M now to cover operating expenses for the next 2 years and grants for 1 year. Assuming a UNI price of $7.04*, this initial request totals to 2,840,909 UNI.
$54M, to be disbursed by the Uniswap Treasury in 6-12 months once the UF has completed the establishment of its legal entity. The UF will publish a post on the forum notifying the community a week prior to putting forth a formal governance proposal for the remaining funds. In other words, because this proposal approves the full amount of funding, we will not go through an additional the Temperature Check and Consensus Check steps to receive this second disbursement.
*To calculate our final UNI request we will use the 30 day TWAP on the day we put forth our Governance Proposal. $7.04 is approximately the 30 day TWAP as of 8/3/2022.

Governance Participation
The UF is also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance.

These tokens will be delegated to the UF by the Uniswap DAO through a new smart contract design, The Franchiser, which ensures the tokens are only used for delegation, and allows the DAO to claw back the tokens at any time. The UF plans to use these tokens primarily for delegation to community members without the requisite 2.5M UNI to submit a governance proposal, however the UF may also self-delegate the UNI to vote, and to put up its own proposals.

The Franchiser was developed by Noah Zinsmeister and was audited by Trail of Bits.

Next Steps
We are excited to discuss this proposal with the broader community as it passes through the Request for Comment phase. Should sentiment be positive, a Temperature Check Snapshot poll will be set up on Mon., August 8. If the Temperature Check poll passes, additional feedback will be incorporated before moving forward to the Consensus Check.

Additionally, to discuss the proposal and answer your questions, we plan to attend the Uniswap Community call at 4 PM EST on Wed., August 10, and to host a Twitter Spaces on @uniswapgrants at 11 AM EST on Mon., August 15.

453,"### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to introduce an NFT event check-in solution based on ApeChain, combining hardware products (NFC chips and scanners) and software products (an app based on ApeChain) to provide NFT holders with an immersive experience at all NFT offline events.

*Specific Implementation Plan:*

In terms of hardware products, we will use NFC technology combined with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) to embed NFC chips into peripheral products, including clothing, hats, toys, and skateboards. We will also design and manufacture NFC scanners to detect products with NFC chips and read selected NFT image data in an app based on ApeChain, then display on a large screen to realize the conceptual scenario of NFT as our web3 identity and participate in real offline events. Simultaneously, scanners will also be used to support the “Unmanned check-in” model in Merch stores.

In terms of software products, we will develop an app based on ApeChain, offering features such as wallet connecting, NFT selection, and animated scene corresponding to the ticket you purchased. The app will provide a user-friendly interface for NFT holders to easily use the check-in system. All check-in animations can be individually created and saved by users, forming a unique user-generated content (UGC) culture, which also makes it easier to spread within communities and out of the web3. For event organizers, animating event tickets to become a unique background for attendees can help expand the brand’s influence and generate much higher traffic than traditional marketing methods.

This solution will fully leverage the image of all NFTs, providing NFT holders with a more immersive experience and enriching existing methods of peripheral product distribution. It will create unique and native web3 gameplay during the offline events and provide all NFTs with more practical value beyond avatars.


### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The proposed NFT event check-in solution will bring several benefits to the APECHAIN ecosystem:

* Enhanced Adoption and Engagement: By providing NFT holders with an immersive experience at web3 offline events, the solution will increase adoption and engagement within the $APE ecosystem. NFT holders will feel more connected to the ecosystem and be incentivized to participate in events and activities.
* Increased Visibility and Recognition: The innovative nature of the check-in solution, coupled with its use of ApeChain, will enhance the visibility and recognition of $APE in the broader market. This will attract more users, projects, and potential collaborators to the ecosystem, driving its growth and fostering a vibrant community.
* Diversification of Use Cases: The check-in solution will demonstrate the versatility of $APE beyond where we are right now, showcasing its potential in the realm of NFT event management and engagement. This diversification of use cases will attract new projects and investors to $APE, expanding its reach and utility.

Overall, the NFT event check-in solution will contribute to the growth and development of the APE CHAIN ecosystem, defining APE CHAIN as the primary chain for all NFTs and continuously providing value for all $APE holders.



### OVERALL COST 
Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 480,000 $APE The specific allocation is as follows:

##### APECOIN REVENUE MODEL:
Single Instance Revenue Forecast

![Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 4.58.59 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreifltrbdt2idzmxfeipb6il7veqa5nzfw3lagkxvj2hh6snljhq2a4)
    
##### Total Revenue:* 120,000 $APE + Total Revenue * 1%

This table clearly outlines the revenue forecast for a single instance, providing a comprehensive view of the potential earnings from our proposed solution.

*50% of gross revenues will be returned to APECOIN DAO, in perpetuity.

NOTE:
* Fees will be charged for the services provided by the check-in solution and “Unmanned check-in” model, and only $APE will be used for payment.
* Offline merch stores adopting the “Unmanned check-in” model can only be paid with $APE.
* NFC customization will be charged separately and paid for using $APE.
* $APE will be consumed in the APP as Gas fee

By implementing this proposal, APECOIN will establish a robust check-in solution that benefits NFT holders, drives revenue growth, and expands its influence in the web3 space.

> # Summary
>
>
>
> * **This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for rETH/WETH on Polygon zkEVM**.
> * **The underlying pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP)**. E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.
> * **The pool shall have a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.

> * WETH is an ERC-20 version of ETH. - [WETH](https://weth.io/)

> # Motivation
>
>
>
> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:
>
>
>
> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.

> Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. A similar E-CLP to the one mentioned in this proposal has been recently deployed on Arbitrum.

# Summary

As a recap, on 13 April 2022, a [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-incorporation-of-the-balancer-foundation/2989) was brought to the BalancerDAO (or the “DAO”) to incorporate the Balancer Foundation (or the “Foundation”). The Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work, furthering Balancer’s decentralization goals, and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.

The Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate, and provides, among others, two primary benefits:

It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts. In addition, for example, it intends to establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto.

It encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, it could engage business development or tech providers.

In short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the BalancerDAO in the structure of the traditional business world.

The Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.

Running a Foundation Company comes with certain real-world costs and financial reserve requirements. These are laid out below, first in summary and then in detail for reference.

## Specification - Foundation Expenses and reserves

This proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2022 running through March 2023, and a self-insurance reserve.

### Foundation Expenses

The summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.

The Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, so April / May /June is the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, although it is the first quarter for which funding is requested.

1. Q2 FY22 - USDC 32,941 - actual expenses incurred through the end of May 2022 and forecast for June 2022 - immediate payment requested
2. Q3 FY22 - USDC 67,919 - for transfer 25 June 2022
3. Q4 FY22 - USDC 67,969 - for transfer 25 September 2022
4. Q1 FY23 - USDC 78,384 - for transfer 15 December 2022

The table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter. Descriptions for each line item are included under the “Detail” section further below.

![|624x417.174903581549](upload://vPqyfiEv162ngVFJ64ipxJDv5Ii.jpeg)

### Foundation Self Insurance Reserve

As part of this proposal, we are asking BalancerDAO to hold the equivalent of US$500,000 as a self-insurance reserve, earmarked for a year and to be revisited after a year. The reserve can be maintained in BAL tokens given current market conditions, but must at all times be available to the Foundation should it be needed, and must be maintained at an equivalent value of US$500,000. More on this reserve requirement can be found in the “Detail” section below.

Note: the proposal is for funding at the Balancer Foundation level, it does not include funding for:

1. Balancer OpCo Limited, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) subsidiary and operating company that will house the front-end development team for BalancerDAO,
2. Other third-party service providers to the BalancerDAO, such as Orb Collective and Kolektivo Labs.

Proposals for funding these three entities will follow separately.

# Detail

For reference, please see below descriptions of the individual line items.

## Annual Secretary Fee

Under Cayman Law, a foundation company must at all times have a secretary who is a 'qualified person' (i.e. a person licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services). The secretary has a duty to ensure that the company complies with applicable Cayman Islands legislation governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.

Neither the secretary fee nor the registered office fee includes the preparation of minutes and resolutions. The Foundation will prepare these for typical matters but might seek assistance from Campbells if complex matters arise.

These fees are due in January each year.

## Registered Office and Registrar of Companies fees (via Campbells Corporate Services Cayman)

Annual registered office and registrar fee – US$2,915.12, which consists of:

- Registered Office fee of US$ 1,495.00

- Beneficial Ownership Reporting and Register Maintenance Fee of US$225.00

- Economic Substance Notification Fee of US$125.00

- Registrar Annual Return Fee of US$853.66

- Supplementary Registered Office License Fee of US$91.46

- Sundry Disbursements of US$125.00

Includes:

- providing the registered office and registered agent

- maintaining the statutory registers

- preparation and submission of annual returns

- filing economic substance notifications

- maintaining the UBO register and reporting on the same

These fees are due in January each year.

## Additional Campbells Corporate Services costs

Any legal advice that may be requested from time to time will be charged on a time spent basis. Any additional corporate requests (for example, requests for certificates, certified documents, updates to registers, filing changes, mail forward, etc – these are all in addition to the annual fees) will also be charged separately.

## Governance/Supervisory Services

### Non-Executive Director and Supervisor Responsibilities

Under the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.

“Supervisor”, for a foundation company, means a person, other than a member, who under the foundation company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.

The non-executive director responsibilities are:

* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors
* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation
* To work with the wider board of directors to:
  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;
  * set an agenda for board meetings;
  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate
* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate
* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission
* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary
* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director
* Set the tone to involve the Balancer ecosystem in developing long-range programs to support and increase all types of contributions to Balancer projects
* Set the tone to harmonize the ecosystem working with the board, the service providers, and projects and adjacent foundations to find opportunities to collaborate and reduce confusion.

### Community Board Member duties

The Directors have ultimate responsibility for the management of the Foundation. In particular, the Director’s responsibilities will include:

* complying with all reasonable requests, instructions and regulations made or given by the Board (or by any duly authorized committee thereof) and give to the Board such explanations, information, and assistance the Board may reasonably require

* attending all meetings of the Board in person or by video/phone; provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary, as applicable, with reasonable advance notice; and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances;

* bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO, strategy, policy, resources, performance, and regulatory matters;

* providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, adherence to terms set forth in the Articles;

* planning, developing, and enhancing the future strategic direction of the DAO

* sharing responsibility with the other director(s) of the Company for the effective management of the Company

### CEO/Management duties

The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Foundation, which includes the following roles:

1. Liaising with the board on all budgets, project proposals, and matters particularly as it relates to service providers including the BVI subsidiary

* Reporting to the board in a timely manner on all matters of importance including financial status, funding projections, policy setting, planning, program operations, employee matters, and the long-term health of the ecosystem.
* Providing adequate materials and analysis to assist the board in making decisions on all matters of importance.

2. Manage Finances and Service Providers

* Overseeing all financial management of the Foundation, including budgets for Board approval, grant, and funding administration required by either the Foundation or other supporters. Possessing thorough knowledge of all funding sources and required records.
* Maintaining and adapting the organizational structure and systems capable of meeting the needs of the Foundation in carrying out its mission.
* Overseeing BVI subsidiary operations including staff and logins as needed (Twitter, GitHub, Discord). Contracts with BVI for service providers.
* Setting up and administering the Foundation’s bank account
* Setting up and managing token custodian

3. Involving the board, ecosystem participants, service provider staff as needed in developing organizational goals, a strategic plan, and projections for supporting the Balancer mission through service providers (Orb Collective Inc and BVI subsidiary) and the community.

* Overseeing vendors & others involved in actively seeking software and product developments and funds as needed.
* Ensuring that the Balancer projects delegated to service providers and the ecosystem have clear objectives that are within the scope of the resources and mission of the Foundation.
* Overseeing the gathering, analysis, and reporting of data illustrating the work accomplished by service providers to manage performance and deliverables
* Reviewing program evaluation results and developing and executing strategies for continual improvement.

4. Compliance

* Responsible for all necessary filings, responses to inquiries, management of AML Compliance vendor, and other Cayman Foundation compliance and risk-related matters

5. and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation.

## Legal Counsel

The Foundation may from time to time require advice on matters of Cayman law. It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item. We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter. For clarity, this refers to the legal team rather than the corporate services team.

## Self Insurance

It is typical for an organization to obtain insurance to protect itself against the legal, regulatory and operational risks, as well as to protect the directors and officers from personal liability for carrying out their duties. We have not seen reasonable insurance for organizations of this nature in the market, hence the need to self-insure.

We are asking for $500,000 based on the costs of defending Balancer in the event of a regulatory inquiry, class action or other lawsuit or vulnerability to the ecosystem. The self-insurance is based on recent DeFi matters within the last 12 months which have cost on average $100,000 monthly to defend. It is important to note, that we have excluded any reserve for payment of damages, fines, or impact on users.

Since this is a reserve and not an expense, the Directors may assess in the future that a lower reserve amount becomes sufficient and propose changes to the DAO. We are asking that the DAO bookmarks these funds to hold for self-insurance.

## Bank Fees

The Foundation is working to establish a bank relationship that we are advised could take approximately 6-8 weeks once the application is complete and submitted. This line item is an estimate/placeholder for monthly fees

## Accounting Software

Estimate for monthly software subscription fees.

457,"## Summary
The objective of this proposal by Chaos Labs is to recommend supply caps for v3 assets that are currently uncapped. This proposal follows the fast-track process for increasing supply caps as outlined [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-v3-supply-borrow-cap-management-fast-track-process/8045). It’s important to note that these are initial supply caps for these assets and will be iterated upon. The recommendations for every asset on every chain take into consideration:

- Asset Market Cap
- Asset Counter Party Risk
- Asset Volume
- Asset Liquidity (DEX and CEX based)
- Historical Liquidations in times of high volatility

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with SingularityDAO! SingularityDAO is a project utilizing AI–powered DeFi portfolios, with products such as [**DynaSets**](https://singularitydao.ai/dynasets/).

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn SDAO tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 350,000 SDAO
 - **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 04 Jul 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 03 Aug 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.4050 SDAO 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the SDAO Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a SDAO-BUSD farm. The farm will have 0.5x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.1x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the farm period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.

#### What is $SDAO?

From the team: “SingularityDAO is a DeFi Protocol designed to provide returns that is agnostic towards market trends. This is achieved by utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and tapping upon the experiences of professional traders in the team.


The SDAO token provides the following utilities: governance; fee sharing (from DynaSets performance fees); launchpad access; staking rewards; and liquidity mining.”

460,"#### ABSTRACT

This project proposes the development of a Discord bot dedicated to real-time tracking of ApeCoin prices. In addition to providing information on the current price, daily, monthly, and annual percentage changes, trading volume, market capitalization, and changes from the all-time high price, the bot is also capable of generating comparative charts between ApeCoin and Ethereum over a seven-day period.


####  BENEFITS TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:

A bot on Discord that displays the prices of APE coin, and creates comparative charts with other currencies can bring various benefits to Ape coin community. Here are some of the potential benefits:
* Immediate access to information: With a bot, we won’t need to leave Discord or open another tab to check APE coin price. You’ll have access to this information directly on Discord, which makes real-time price monitoring more convenient.
* Useful visual comparisons: Comparison charts can help visualize APE coin performance with Ethereum more effectively than just numbers. This can help in making investment decisions.
* Updated and reliable information: In a volatile market like cryptocurrency, having the most recent information can be crucial for investment decision-making. With a bot, we can be sure that you are getting the Updated and reliable (because the data comes from the API provided by coingecko) information possible.
* Efficiency: Having all this information in one place, and easily accessible, can significantly increase the efficiency of your trading or investment analysis.
* Community: The bot can be a valuable resource for your community, offering additional value to your members and encouraging more interaction.

####  OVERALL COST

this bot has no costs because it is hosted on a free version of the squarecloud server, it is enough to meet your needs

title: [ARFC] wETH Interest Rate Curve - Ethereum v2
Discussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-weth-wsteth-interest-rate-curve-ethereum-network/11372
Short description: Upgrade wETH interest rate on Ethereum v2 to match Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.
author: @Llamaxyz - Defi_Consulting
dated: 2023-01-29

---

# Summary

@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend wETH interest rate parameters on the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.

# Abstract

Following on from the forum discussion relating to wETH and wstETH interest rates across Ethereum v2 and v3, this Snapshot will focus on implementing the wETH interest rate parameter changes on Aave v2.

Since the recent wETH parameter upgrade on v2, Aave has experienced improved overall revenue. However, TVL and daily revenue are gradually declining. 

This proposal intends to adjust the v2 wETH interest rate curve to match the v3 wETH interest rate curve which is expected to lead to high utilization of the v2 wETH reserve and partially offset the emerging declining week on week revenue trend.

# Motivation

Since AIP 131 was implemented, the amount of stETH deposited as collateral to borrow wETH has been fairly consistent. However, the amount of wETH borrowed by users who deposited stETH as collateral has reduced from 515.21K to 413.74K between 18th December 2022 and 15th January 2023 (pre Aave v3 launch). The tapering of borrowing demand is reflected in Aave’s wETH nominated revenue figures as shown below.

![](https://i.imgur.com/YQpHY0c.png)

The market is indicating that there is insufficient demand for borrowing wETH. Three possible reasons are shown below:

* Structured products charge a fee
* Additional smart contract risk
* Elevated exposure to DEX liquidity

Our analysis indicates the Slope1, 5.75%, is most likely the primary causes of the reduced wETH demand. Lowering the Slope1 parameter will enable users to achieve a higher return from entering the recursive loop strategy. The chart below shows how users that deposit stETH and borrow wETH have behaved to date. The date highlighted below is the date AIP131 was executed.



This proposal intends to reduce the Slope1 parameters on the v2 market to 3.8% and introduce a Base of 1%. The borrowing rate at the Upotimal point is reduced from 5.75% to 4.8% (Base + Slope1). Introducing a Base, with a Lower Slope1 (4.8% < 5.75%) parameter, acts to reduce the gradient between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal compared to having a Slope1 = Base + Lower Slope1. 

The graphic below shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curves.

![](https://i.imgur.com/72v0mJr.png)

The graphic below shows the proposed interest rate with Base, Slope1 and Slope2 parameters detailed.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BKd9DUk.png)

It is worth noting that borrowing wETH becomes slightly more expensive at lower utilization compared to the current wETH interest rate. When utilization is less than 41% borrowing costs are higher, ranging 0 to 0.98%, and when utilization is greater than 41% borrowing costs are lower, ranging 0 to 0.95%. Current utilization is 46% on the v2 deployment which means the borrowing costs would be reduced.

The chart below shows the relative change in borrowing costs for users, comparing the current versus the proposed interest rate curve.

![](https://i.imgur.com/6XyC2Hn.png)

# Specification

The below table shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curve for the Ethereum v2 and v3 deployment.

|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Uoptimal|80.00|80.00|
|Base|0.00|1.00|
|Slope1|5.75|3.80|
|Slope2|80.00|80.00|

PrimeDAO is collaborating with Gyroscope to its liquidity from the ETH Mainnet D2D / USDC pool to a pool that uses GYD on Arbitrum instead. Having an rETH / D2D and GYD / D2D pool on Arbitrum will likely increase the volumes for both pools

Title: [ARFC]  Retroactive bug bounties proposal (pre-Immunefi)

Author: BGD Labs @bgdlabs

Date: 2024-01-09

---

## Summary

Request for bounties pending from before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi official bug bounty program, amounting a grand total of $86’500.

**The objective of this ARFC is to pre-authorise such payments, to be processed via an on-chain AIP**

## Motivation

Before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty program on [September 25th 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/325/), security reports by white hats where evaluated in an ad-hoc basis, proposing bounties/rewards following an approach like on [this proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077). That was not optimal, as there was no formal scope defined, or strict ranges of bounties depending on severity and impact.

Currently, every report is being processed via Immunefi and the rules of the Aave program, however, there were other reports submitted via other channel before that (usually security@aave.com). As these reports should be evaluated at time of submission for fairness, and outside of the Immunefi scope defined afterwards, we think it is a good idea to reward them separately and retro-actively outside the program.

## Specification

### Reports

First of all, we want to clarify certain aspects for the community:

- The proposed rewards and evaluation metrics follow the ones we did ad-hoc in the past [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077#clarification-on-evaluation-2), as we don’t think it is fair for the white-hats to apply the rewards ranges on the current Immunefi program and out-of-scope rules, as they were defined afterwards.
- In one of the cases, we recommended the white hat to submit the report via Immunefi, in order to have access to the mediation procedure of the platform. As this mediation process was finally requested by the white hat, Immunefi charges the corresponding fee of 10% of the amount, which we think is legitimate.
- At the moment, *we are not disclosing the full details of some of the reports*, because even if none of them create any risk for Aave now, one has dependencies with another report (not disclosed yet) and the other could increase risk to non-Aave entities.


### 1. Inconsistent validation on  Aave v2/v3

When calling `borrow()` with stable rate mode on Aave v2 and v3, one of the validations is that not more than a percentage of the total available liquidity can be borrowed at once.

However, `swapBorrowRateMode()` doesn’t validate the same, which is unexpected and could lead to more stable rate borrowings than intended.

It is important to highlight that this is not possible at the moment, with minting of stable rate disabled.


**Severity:  Low**

The issue didn’t create any immediate problem in the protocol, but overexposure to stable rate mode is not expected.

**Likelihood:  Certain**

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.

**Proposed bounty:** 10’000 USD

---

### 2. Inconsistent HF (Health Factor) behaviour swap borrow rate mode

When swapping borrow rate mode, the HF of an user is not validated, as debt should remain the same. However, under edge scenarios, the HF of an user could slightly change (by ~1 unit of lowest asset’s decimals).


**Severity:  No impact**

This is not a bug or creates any exploit scenario, but it is unexpected behaviour.

**Likelihood:  Certain**

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.

**Proposed bounty:** 5’000 USD

---

### 3. Price manipulation of asset listed on Aave

By executing a complex strategy (involving compromising the asset’s trusted infrastructure), it could be possible to inflate the price of one of the assets listed on Aave v2.

Even if this belongs more to the centralisation risk of the asset, and we don’t consider a bug of the protocol, it was taken into account for off-boarding consideration of the asset by risk providers of Aave, and we believe it is fair to reward retro-actively.

As this risk still exist on the asset itself and more protocols could be using it, even if we don’t really see any immediate risk, we will not be disclosing at the moment details of it, until the team applies extra measures.


**Severity:  Critical**

Being a price manipulation, the impact on the protocol would hypotetically be important.

**Likelihood: Not likely**

The attack involves compromising asset’s infrastructure (which would directly disqualify on the current Aave <> Immunefi program), together with extra techniques; so we consider it theoretically possible, but highly improbable.

**Proposed bounty:** 65’000 USD. Additionally, 6’500 USD as Immunefi fee.

## Next steps

If this ARFC is positive, afterwards we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal, releasing the funds to the corresponding addresses.",bullish

title: [ARFC] Grant OP Emission_Admin for Optimism v3 Liquidity Pool to Lido DAO
author: @Llamaxyz , DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham )
created: 2022-02-15

---

# Summary

This proposal is to enable Lido DAO to distribute OP rewards across the Aave v3 Optimism Liquidity Pool.

The `Emission_Admin` role for OP on Optimism is currently assigned to the Optimism team and is to be transferred to Lido DAO.

# Abstract

Lido seeks to distribute OP rewards across to the Aave v3 Optimism deployment. To achieve this, the `EmissionManager` function reassigns an owner to the `Emission_Admin` role for OP, [1,2].

The wallet with `Emission Admin` permission for OP then controls the distribution of OP and LDO rewards on the Optimism Liquidity Pool. This proposal will enable LDO and OP rewards to be distributed across the Optimism v3 deployment. 

# Motivation

Enable Lido DAO to distribute OP rewards across the Optimism v3 Liquidity Pools.

Lido DAO is about to receive a grant nominated in OP tokens that are to be used for bootstrapping the adoption of wstETH on the Optimism network. 

The Lido Liquidity Mining Committee (LMC) will be determining the emission rate and duration that OP rewards are offered on the Aave v3 deployment.

Typically, the LMC meets and determines the next 30 days rewards to be distributed on a rolling basis. This means each month, the committee will determine if to extend the OP rewards, or change the amount of OP being offered across the Aave v3 Liquidity Pools on Optimism.

# Specification

The `EmissionManager`, a governance controlled function, assigns the `Emission_Admin` role for a specified token, OP, on each respective network. 

The `Emission_Admin` role controls the distribution of the specified token, OP, across the specified Aave deployment.

The `Emission_Admin` can distribute OP anywhere across the Aave v3 on the Optimism Liquidity Pool.

470,"#### ABSTRACT

This AIP aims to build an ecosystem of GameFi NFT-based DAOs and vault, powered by ApeCoin. Using smart contract wallets, the AIP will establish a lend/borrow NFT assets & rewards vault for the game community.

The ApeDAO wanted to implement active user engagement in a Game community by enabling GameFi Segment with the DAO and smart contract Wallets. As NFT-based P2E games grow in popularity, NFT asset management ecosystems - driven by the community - are becoming essential, as they allow asset rotation among active community members. This maximizes the potential of NFT DeFi.

Gamified DAOs are built in a way that only allows active wallets to keep the assets and continue participating in the game. For inactive assets, the DAO will run a vote to pull them from the member wallets and into the vault. The assets will later be reallocated to other members, as per the policy set by the DAO members.

This approach increases NFT scarcity and price in the market which will eventually attract more buyers and investment in the ApeCoin-driven DAO community. Furthermore, the DAO will offer incentives to participating voters, creating a constructive cycle of engagement.

All the DAO processes will run on a predefined set of rules to streamline community governance.

Each game community will have its own DAO and members where rules of governance and different policies are defined by the community members. Once the governance is established, a dedicated vault is created/ deployed for each community to lend their assets either as an individual member or through a community proposal for pooled resources. The community can buy assets for the vault to be later lent to the players and earn rewards based on a distribution set by the DAO distribution policy.

  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/ed8198ae9f5497dd3b2f0a781a195470bb958883.png)

![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/5855ab13bc32f1efe3b38ac0e0bcc7f01283f452.png)

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

Only the APE Coinholder will have the opportunity to create and engage in game DAO and vaults. Thus, anyone who plays games using the vault assets must hold APE coins, the DAO member will receive a share of rewards, in some cases without engaging in the game directly (feature to be explored at a later stage).

* Bring in new members to the Ape community and effectively grow the community
* Enable a safe and fair lending system to “put to work” all NFTs, thus increasing their use cases, value, and market dynamics
* Attract more players to the Ape-related games through the ApeDAOs and large investors and guilds
* Make the ApeCoin ecosystem, in general, more guild-friendly; large investors and guilds would feel more motivated on investing in Ape-related NFTs and projects and bringing their network into the action

#### OVERALL COST

**$520k denominated in APE coins**

2m STZ tokens will be given to the ApeDAO as partnership value, equivalent to 2.02% of the token's total supply.
(STZ tokens will have a 6 months lock up period, starting from the day the ApeDAO fund are received.)

V3 sets fees on a pool-by-pool basis, with a fee of 0 as the default. The fee may be set to 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. This is interpreted as one over the specified number. For example, a 100bps fee tier pool with a parameter of 5 would be a 20% protocol share of the fee, and thus would be 20bps to the protocol and 80bps to LPs. Another example is a 30bps fee tier pool with a parameter of 10 would be a 10% protocol fee and thus would be 3bps to the protocol and 27bps to LPs.

Gauntlet's risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify risk parameters, including Loan To Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across 6 assets on Ethereum v3, Arbitrum v3 and Ethereum v2. For more details, see the full forum post [here]( https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825/1).


## Motivation

These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations and they seek to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, the expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics shown in the [full forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825) can help understand why some parameter recommendations have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for the recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.
For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

## Specification

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at reasonable levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. Our simulations show that we can improve the balance of risk and capital efficiency by making the parameter changes specified below.

Ethereum Aave v3 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|DAI Loan to Value |67%|77%
|USDC Liquidation Threshold|79%|80%
|WSTETH Liquidation Bonus|7%|6%

Arbitrum Aave v3 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|LINK Liquidation Threshold	|75%|77.5%

Ethereum Aave v2 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|CRV Loan to Value |52%|0%
|SNX Liquidation Threshold|62%|59%

Gauntlet continues to [recommend](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644/41) setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass.

Lowering SNX LT by 3% will liquidate 0x8ae928cb080aa43a50393cd08de208ef2b1bb86a, who currently has HF 1.00 and supplies $50 SNX, $1300 USDC to borrow TUSD, BAT, and ZRX. 
## Risk Dashboard
The community should use [Gauntlet’s Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk.

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile insolvency value that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile liquidation volume that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.


**Disclaimer: Gauntlet reserves the right to not move forward with any parameter changes recommended in Snapshot polls, if market conditions change meaningfully.**

Beyond the SWAMP aims to produce a vibrant, high-quality collectible bimonthly magazine claimed through the sale of accompanying NFTs displaying each issue’s cover art—similar to Punks comic but with varying rarity and added rewards. Aside from columns featuring news and difference makers from outside of our ecosystem, content will focus on the ApeCoinDAO, ApeCoinDAO-led initiatives, successful ApeCoinDAO AIPs, and ApeCoin use cases; Yuga Labs and the growing number of projects under their umbrella; brands utilizing holder IP; diversity within regional meetup groups; female collectors; augmented reality through a sponsorship with [Art House](https://www.arthouse.ar/); gaming; art, tech and blockchain. All primary sales will be conducted in APE, contributors will be paid in APE and any future revenue raised from in-magazine advertising will be received in APE.

![7a8965fe628196ffd743b2f0b881b60fda91b8a9_2_1035x690.png](ipfs://bafkreicls456jlpmrsc5fdchfmgh2yabp2ehbletdux7ukj4k3y5rorza4)

Our mission is to create an onramp into the ApeCoin and Yuga Labs ecosystems while strengthening ties between existing communities. We will take an ethical approach to journalism, provide culture-driven meaningful content, and act as a springboard for existing and up-and-coming artists. Our team is made up by a creative director with a history in bookmaking alongside a team of illustrators and graphic designers.

We also want to further-facilitate artists by providing interview space and fair compensation for cover art. Additional features include spotlights on active community members; regional BAYC groups like Bored Club Canada, TaiwanDAO, FrenchApeYC and associations like PinkDAO; women in the space; Blender tips and tech talk; metaverse; memes; music and photography; generative artwork; Meebin with the Meebits; Mutants are INSANE; Mutant Cartel and the Mutant Hounds; Cryptopunks and Cryptopunks history; 10ktf; interviews; features on ApeCoinDAO Special Council members and Stewards; discussions with founders; security tips; advertisements from brands utilizing holder IP (ApeWater, ForeverApes etc); gaming; as well as articles written by contributors sourced from projects like Nouns, Doodles, Gutter Cat Gang, Moonbirds, CloneX, and Deadfellaz. We will also be including advanced in-magazine AR capabilities to bring artwork, advertising and otherwise static NFTs to life triggered by QR codes.

Also important to note that as marketing in the NFT space shifts away from macro influencers we believe that providing community-driven content packaged in a collectible physical form will initiate broader trust from outsiders and better prepare them for onboarding. It should also be said that for some collectors, tangible products often feel longer lasting or more real than digital; particularly to those just entering the space. That being said many others prefer tokens, so keeping those community members in mind we want to include additional NFT packs based on Beyond the SWAMP NFT rarity.

Beyond the SWAMP is seeking a one-time grant for company development and first issue production. The layout of our magazine will be completed by a team of career creatives specializing in layout, illustration and graphic design. Beginning with an initial rollout of 350 copies, we will create an economy of scale increasing to 500 copies for our second issue and 750 copies from issues three to six totalling 3850 magazines in our first year at an average production cost of $13.63 per copy. Taking this approach will allow us to grow our readership cautiously during tumultuous market conditions while lowering the overall grant request and cost to the community. External services and service providers include advisors, legal, website builders, smart contract developer, audit team, printing and promotion.

479,"### Motivation

Since the [approval of the CREAM/WETH gauge](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xa8ef52b06d2e5742e9068582276e878441c29a924e8bb2a9c26686d5284a9106) back on May 24th Balancer has earned ~$12k in protocol fees while[ spending ~$1.55M worth of BAL emissions](https://dune.com/tianqi/Balancer-Gauge-Weight). The CREAM gauge is the largest recipient of BAL emissions while returning virtually zero fee revenue to the protocol. Long term mechanisms like the recently passed [“core pools” proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x28bd2c5580f5a8effacdceb0aec52e9bc63987fa4f4a39f8b8223257ca4376cc) should help naturally correct this imbalance as market forces are given time to work though even in an optimistic scenario the CREAM gauge will remain very large for the foreseeable future.

Per [recent discussion](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/discussion-kill-cream-weth-gauge/3396) on the forum the community is split on this issue. Governance did approve the CREAM gauge in a legitimate vote and BAL was bought on the open market and locked in veBAL to vote for it. Governance also has the power to vote to kill any gauge for any reason and everyone participating in veBAL accepts these are the rules.

The Balancer ecosystem has significant funding requirements that currently far exceed our revenue generation based on the last 30 days. At this point in time the largest blocker to Balancer reaching sustainability is the existence of the CREAM gauge. There is enough support in the community for killing the gauge that it is appropriate to move this to a vote in my view - this proposal will be sent to the Governance Council for approval next Thursday, July 14th.

### Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `grantRole` on the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` with the following arguments:

role: `0xec1d467d9ab03a0079c22a89037209f5763aec973897ea763e2cf25d71a5f12e`
account: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`

The role can be verified [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json). This will give the DAO Multisig the ability to call `killGauge` on a pool's gauge. 

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will then call `killGauge` on the CREAM/WETH Gauge `0x9F65d476DD77E24445A48b4FeCdeA81afAA63480`",bullish

This proposal seeks to garner community support to whitelist the Beethoven X Gnosis Safe multisig on Ethereum to vote-lock B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the Beethoven X community into veBAL to participate in governance for the Balancer DAO and gauge voting, specifically for pools on Optimism.

**Motivation**

Beethoven X is the first official friendly fork built on Balancer V2 that is native to the Fantom network. Beethoven recently partnered with Balancer to [launch on Optimism](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xd281d8cad43c97814b2496270498c4396b16c0f2ce522d5bc554aae9fed4e4d7). The Beethoven X community [has passed a proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x3d6e0373f0f1c041a82e6108a01aee2e00a21be43667259126b70e5fd2a5f93a) to increase the exposure to Balancer via: the market purchase of $25,000 worth of B-80BAL-20WETH to lock as veBAL; the direction of a portion of Beethoven’s protocol fees on a monthly basis towards the purchase of B-80BAL-20WETH to lock as veBAL; and the commitment to bridge any farmed BAL tokens on Optimism to Ethereum to purchase B-80BAL-20WETH to lock as veBAL.

**Risks**

No significant risks have been identified with this proposal.

title: ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token
status: WIP
author: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham
created: 21-03-2022

# Simple Summary

Acquire 200,000 BAL tokens via a combination of performing a BAL for AAVE token swap. The BAL tokens are to be complemented with ETH and deposited into the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year. The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools, [1].

# Abstract

Perform a token swap with Balancer by exchanging AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve for 200,000 BAL tokens. The exchange rate to be used is the 90-day moving average price when the votes pass on both sides. 

All 200,000 BAL tokens plus the aBAL tokens in the Reserve Factor (redeemed for BAL) are to be paired with sufficient ETH and deposited into the Balancer V2 BAL:ETH (80:20) pool. The veBAL holding will then participate in Balancer's revised tokenomics that commenced on the 28th March. 

Initially, the veBAL will be used to vote BAL rewards to pools which support aTokens that create TVL for Aave and/or AAVE liquidity pools.

# Motivation

Aave and Balance have a long history of working together. The AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drive TVL to Aave markets, [2].

When the AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool is moved to Balancer V2 and integrated into Aave’s Safety Module, the veBAL tokens can be used to vote BAL rewards to the newly created AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V2 pool.

In addition, the veBAL can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [3]. There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using veBAL to vote for BAL rewards to pools that strengthen Aave is a strategic advantage of deploying the BAL tokens into the BAL:ETH pool.

By exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. The token exchange, plus additional acquisition, is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder, based on etherscan BAL holder rankings, [4]. Balancer will become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [5]. Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate.

Aave will likely be one of the first movers in the upcoming BAL wars and will gain a strategic advantage to bootstrap new Balancer Boosted Pools which lead to tokens being deposited in Aave markets to earn yield. This has the benefit of creating TVL and Revenue for Aave.

The initial sizing to acquire 200,000 BAL was something that was reached via discussions with the Balancer community and happens to be the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer token swap, [6].

The initial sizing was also determined by the ability to influence how the BAL emissions are to be distributed. If all BPT from the BAL : ETH pool are converted to veBAL, Aave will receive 3.3% of the 14,500 BAL emission schedule which is equivalent to 478 BAL weekly, or $8,126/week at $17/BAL or $422,552/year. If 100% of the current BPT were deposited into the veBAL contract, the yield is very close to 10%. Other deployments from the Reserve Factor will also earn BAL rewards over time, [7].

With 3.3% of veBAL supply, Aave will determine where 2,680 of the 81,200 BAL tokens are to be distributed each week via the Ethereum mainnet pool gauge. This is equivalent to 5% APR on a $47.40M pool without any compounding or other yield sources like swap fees or yield from Aave markets. This is sufficient to support bootstrapping new liquidity pools that support growing TVL for the Aave community. Given the size of the Aave community investment in the Balancer community, it is reasonable to think that Liquidity Mining Committee may also be voting to allocate a portion of there 14,500 weekly BAL emission to support Balancer Boosted Pools which drive TVL to Aave markets.

# Implementation

The token swap is to be performed by both Balancer and Aave by depositing tokens into a contract like how Tribe DAO swapped TRIBE for INDEX, [8].

The aBAL holding in the Reserve Factor, 1,890 aBAL at the time of writing which will be redeemed for BAL and deployed along with the 200,000 BAL tokens attained via the proposed swap, [9].

Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor from there the BAL and matching amount of ETH will be deployed into the BAL : ETH pool on Balancer V2. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year.

The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools

488,"## TLDR;
graviAURA tokens inside of a Balancer gauge will not overvote for the guage they are in if the gauge has 10% or more of the total vote weight. The graviAURA vote weight will instead vote for core pools based on the bribe distribution with 90% of its vote weight and the usual 10% vote weight fee will be taken by BadgerDAO.

## Outcome:
The above fix will align the interests of BadgerDAO, BalancerDAO, naked graviAURA depositors and graviAURA LPs in gauges. This will also allow for large veBAL holders to still overvote for graviAURA pools but with diminishing returns.

Using the excess vote weight to vote for bribes will align with Balancer core pools and drive emissions to pools earning the highest fees. This is ideal compared to voting for specific pools as it allows graviAURA to better follow natural market forces and not overvote for pools in an ever changing landscape.

A 3 month time limit will ensure that any interested parties can take the time to bring more complete governance to the table as more data becomes available.

# Simple Summary

This ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) finishes at a further 30% reduced rate.

In addition to tapering incentives on the Aave V2 market, the ARC proposes introducing incentives on the Aave ARC market. 10% of the 30% reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 ethereum market are to be applied to incentivising AUM on the Aave ARC Ethereum market.

# Abstract

Liquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG), renewed by [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) and then incentives were reduced by 30% with the implementation of [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) which expires on the 20th February 2022. A summary is shown below.

* [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E): [2,200 stkAAVE per day](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) from 24th Aug 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH): 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd Nov 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* AIP-X: 1,078 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* AIP-X: 46.2 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market

Continuing on from AIP-47, incentives on low vol assets are to be split 1:2 in favour of borrowers over lenders. This logic will be applied to both Aave V2 and ARC markets. High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.

# Motivation

This proposal continues on from AIP-47 with a further 30% tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior [ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946) and shall last for another proposed 90 day period. We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market.

The incentive APR will fall, even though TVL has reduced with market conditions so has AAVE’s token price.

In addition to incentivising Aave V2 Ethereum market, I would like to present to the community an opportunity to commence distributing stkAAVE incentives on the Aave ARC market with the intention of achieving the following:

1. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)
2. Increase liquidity
3. Attractive (low) borrow rates
4. Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor
5. Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform

Within this proposal we will present two options for the Aave ARC markets, Option 2) will reflect a Total Value Locked in Aave ARC of $250M. This represents a 12.6x increase in TVL from what is a low base. The next iteration of liquidity mining will likely see an increased allocation to Aave ARC as we continue to encourage users to interact with the market. The initial target here is to grow Aave ARV to over $250M within the next 90 days and then pivot as required to support continual growth of the market.

# Specification

The below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 21.02.2021 up to and including 20.05.2022.

Key changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign:

* 30% reduction in incentives to 1,078 stkAAVE per day on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* Introduction of 26.2 stkAAVE per day on Aave ARC Ethereum market
* Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value

The table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave V2 Ethereum market asset listings. In estimating the Borrowing vAPR, a 75% utilisation of the deposited assets was assumed. This was based on the current DAI utilisation.

Note: TVL per token is as per the 3rd February 2022.

The table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave ARC market asset listings.

Option 1) Same Methodology as above allocating 10% of the reduction in Aave V2 Ethereum Market stkAAVE incentives. Ie: 10% of (1,540-1,078)

Option 2) Similar methodology to the above with an assumed market size of $250M and distribution across the assets of 60% USDC, 20% ETH and 10% of both wBTC and AAVE.

# Rationale

The previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal. The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC reflects a desire to grow this mainnet market. Incentivising the Aave ARC market is funded from the reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1,540 to 1,124.2 stkAAVE per day.

Aarve ARC Option 1) we show what impact allocating 10% of the savings from the reduced Aave V2 Ethereum market would look like following a similar allocation strategy to the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The mathematics assumes 75% utilisation of lending pools capital is borrowed which reflects the current utilisation of the DAI pool on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. With zero wBTC deposited in the market, and still very low capital being deposited, this approach is heavily skewed towards USDC and mis represents what is expected with time.

Aave ARC Option 2) we elected to view the incentives in line with $250M and assumed a distribution across the pools. The distribution is an assumption and is quite different to the existing distribution on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. We can easily change these parameters and are happy to do so. The high level logic is to anticipate capital being deposited and then estimating what the vAPR from incentives would equate to. For this we assumed $250M which is arbitrarily chosen as a nice round target, it represents over 10x growth in the market TVL.

# Discussion

The previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets. Link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946). Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market, large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing. (Lending vAPY, - borrowing vAPR, + Borrowing Incentives vAPR, + Lending vAPY)

With the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas. Time in the pool is also a huge factor, and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so. However, it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now. Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions. The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider.

With the introduction of incentives on Aave ARC, even with around $250M deposited 60% in USDC, the strategy would be profitable with a 75% utilisation rate. This risks assets currently deposited in the Aave V2 Ethereum market being reallocated to the Aave ARC market. If this was to occur the vAPR from incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market would increase. It will be interesting to see what effect this has on the value deposited in each pool. Pending how the market reacts to these proposed changes, we can always revisit this and propose an amendment to the distribution schedule across both markets.

## Economics

* Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $44.5K per day during late January 2022. Daily aToken interest is around $1.9K per day.
* Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $168,630 per day assuming 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Down from $231,000 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Note, previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of $320.
* Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $296.89M with an AAVE price of $150.
* 90 days at 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token is $15.18M or around 5.11% of the Ecosystem Reserve.
* The Net spend is $122K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE/day Safety Module incentives
* Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions. Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue.

Further details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community. Please note, each query will need to be run separately.

There is currently 2,515,349.77 FEI in the treasury that originated from a [treasury swap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-treasury-swap-balancer-dao-fei-dao/2254) that occurred in October 2021.  Under the original agreement, the DAO was to use these funds for operational expenses.  The SP’s passed so far require payment in USDC, so I believe it is a good time to convert the FEI into USDC so that the DAO can use it later on to pay expenses without needing to convert the FEI every time the DAO pays out.

Summary

OpenZeppelin has proposed a Security Partnership with Venus protocol for performing security audits on retainer. 

OpenZeppeling currently planned list of audits for Venus new product releases are:

-New Liquidator contract
-Diamond Comptroller
-Automatic allocation of income and Prime contract
-Collecting needed tokens and Shortfall handling (Automated Treasury Management)

As Venus’s trusted security partner, OpenZeppelin will perform continuous security audits of Venus codebases and provide actionable feedback to help the development team improve smart contract security. They offer a total of 24 weeks of security research time to be used over the next 6 months for audits as directed by the Venus dev team, which includes fix reviews and a high-level analysis of current protocol security. The total cost is $554,400 to be paid in USDC on a quarterly schedule from the Venus treasury, starting with $277,200 at the start of Q3 2023 followed by the same amount at the start of Q4.

About OpenZeppelin

OpenZeppelin is a leading blockchain infrastructure security firm that performs security audits and provides developer tools for decentralized systems that power multimillion-dollar economies. OpenZeppelin has set industry standards for building secure, decentralized systems and has gained the trust of industry leaders including Coinbase, the Ethereum Foundation, Matter Labs, and the original Compound protocol. OpenZeppelin built and maintains the world’s leading Open Source library for smart contract development with more than twenty millions downloads and 200 contributors.

OpenZeppelin has already seen success in security partnerships with DAOs including Compound, which forms the backbone of the Venus Protocol codebase. They have already leveraged their existing expertise in lending protocol security to audit the Venus SwapRouter and Oracles codebases for Venus in which they reported 25 total security issues. 

Partnership Offerings

Continuous Security Audits on Retainer: As Venus’s trusted security partner, OpenZeppelin will do a continuous security audit of our codebases. Unlike individual audit engagements, their security researchers will be assigned to work on Venus for the duration of this engagement. This provides scheduling flexibility, enhances auditor knowledge of Venus codebase and builds a more collaborative client-auditor relationship to produce better results. In addition to formal auditing, OpenZeppelin will offer Venus protocol security advisory on Web3 best practices to improve secure code development going forward.

### **Introduction**

Whitelist the BadgerDAO Gnosis Safe multisig, to vote-lock B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the BadgerDAO community into veBAL and participate in governance for the Balancer DAO.

### **Motivation**

BadgerDAO is a well established DAO which seeks to build the infrastructure for Bitcoin in DeFi. We make it easy to bridge your Bitcoin into other blockchains and start earning yield right away. We are big fans fo the Balancer ecosystem and are looking forward to participating in governance and incentivizing more liquidity to flow through Balancer.

### **Risks**

BadgerDAO multisig signers recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

### **Specification**

503,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas/1437). If approved, changes would take effect at **00:00 UTC on Monday, March 8**.

On behalf of the Balancer community, I’d like to propose significant modifications to the ongoing gas reimbursement campaign. We have heard some concerns that the campaign is confusing and that it isn’t clear how much BAL a user will receive for a given trade. During these times of network congestion and high gas costs, we want to provide everyone with an opportunity to trade on Balancer. With that in mind, it doesn’t seem fair to ask users to exercise blind faith and wait until “next Wednesday” to find out what they’ve earned from trading. We would like to make every effort to simplify the campaign and improve transparency; what you see is what you get, or at least as close as possible. We plan to accomplish this by removing various sources of uncertainty from the reimbursement calculations so that it is possible to get an estimate ahead of time and display it to the user at the time of trade submission.

# The Proposal
Allocate **30,000 BAL** from the Ecosystem Fund to the “BAL for Gas'' campaign. There is no fixed time period; the budget is consumed on a **first-come, first-served** basis. When the budget is exhausted, the campaign is suspended until it is replenished by BAL governance.

For **each eligible trade made through the Balancer Exchange Proxy**, award claimable BAL tokens to the trader. An eligible trade is a trade containing one or more eligible swaps, where an eligible swap is a **swap between any two tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json)**. Claims are made available at the [BAL claims interface](https://claim.balancer.finance/#/) on Wednesday (UTC time) following the close of the weekly period (00:00 UTC Monday - 23:59 UTC Sunday) in which the trade occurred.

The amount of gas to be reimbursed is predetermined by the number of eligible swaps within the transaction:

![table|690x185](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/dd83c24ba43bd36e91396a5b6296f4c92cc986c2.png)

For converting gas to BAL, use the **median gas price of the enclosing block** and the **BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko** closest to the block time.

# Motivation
The proposal above may seem familiar, but there are some very important distinctions between this and the previous reimbursement program. All modifications share the common goal of improving user experience, which we believe is a matter of simplification and transparency.

First, this proposed campaign makes no effort to account for the _actual_ expenses of the user. Both the amount of gas consumed by the transaction and the gas price ultimately paid are irrelevant. Instead, deterministic figures are favored: the amount of gas is fixed depending on the number of swaps, and the gas price is the block median, rather than the user’s own price. It is simply too difficult to accurately predict the parameters of a given transaction ahead of time, whereas it is much easier to predict block-wide parameters. Predictability informs transparency.

The second major shift pertains to the budget. The existing program allocates a fixed weekly budget, which can sometimes necessitate cuts to the reimbursements in order to avoid excess spending. Such cuts can only be known _after_ the weekly period has ended, and therefore the existence of a weekly budget renders any trade-time estimates useless. In contrast, here we propose a fixed total budget which is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. This allows us to add reimbursement estimates to the Exchange UI at the time of the trade. If there are still funds remaining in the budget, the user will see an estimate of the amount of BAL to be awarded; and if the budget is exhausted, then the user will simply be informed as such and the estimate will be zero. When the well runs dry, BAL governors can decide whether to replenish and continue the campaign.

Third, the BAL/ETH price model is modified. Whereas the ongoing campaign uses the median price for the whole weekly period, the proposed campaign uses the price as close as possible to the actual block time. Knowing the approximate price at the time of the trade allows us to make informed estimates about the amount of BAL to be awarded.

![image|690x120](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/e00a59183e29b37e29369999caccc6035028b810.png)

Finally, the fixed amounts of gas (130k, 220k, 300k, 400k) were chosen so that only 1% of all trades, on average, would be overcompensated. This should be sufficient to prevent gaming the system for profit, but nonetheless **we reserve the right to filter out suspicious activity**. The Balancer Exchange UI will never perform more than four swaps in a single trade, which is why only four numbers are provided; any transactions containing 5+ swaps must belong to bots, whereas the target audience is end users. We simply cap the reimbursement amount at 400,000 gas; any additional eligible swaps beyond the first four will yield no further benefit.

# Mechanics
Although every effort is made to be as transparent and accurate as possible, there is still a very small amount of room for error. Here we will detail how the BAL amounts are computed both at trade time (estimated) and at dispersal time (actual).

At the time of the trade:

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **estimated** gas price for display purposes is the median from the last few blocks according to the `getGasPrice()` function from the web3 provider. This should provide a good corollary to the median of the actual trade block, which cannot be known in advance.
4. The **estimated** BAL/ETH price for display purposes is queried from the large [80/20 BAL/WETH pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x59a19d8c652fa0284f44113d0ff9aba70bd46fb4/). This acts as a real-time oracle which isn’t worth manipulating because it is only used to display an estimate and not to compute an actual award amount.
5. The user will see, in one summary number, the final result of #1-4: the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for this particular trade, assuming there are still funds left in the budget. A USD estimate is also provided for completeness, with the BAL/USD price being queried from CoinGecko’s API.

The UI changes are still being finalized, but as a mockup consider the image below.

![image2|485x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/1174949f6ce920677d9102bbf6ee0a35627776b8.png)

At dispersal time (computed by the [open source mining scripts](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts)):

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **actual** gas price is the median from the block containing the trade. We will filter out artificially low-price transactions which are sometimes included by miners and can skew the median - these are typically 0-gwei or 1-gwei transactions.
4. The **actual** BAL/ETH price is queried from the CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

It should be clear that the only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are most likely quite small: the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block, and the 80/20 BAL/WETH price may not perfectly match CoinGecko’s BAL/ETH price. All in all, the user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time, and this improved user experience should bring more traders to the campaign.

**Protocol Description:**
Davos Protocol is a decentralized on-chain stablecoin protocol operating on both the Polygon Network and Ethereum Network, governed by the Davos Governance Token (DGT). It enables users to optimize the value of their crypto assets by accessing loans in DUSD stablecoin and earning competitive interest rates. The protocol prioritizes Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) as collateral, leveraging Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism for scalable crypto yield. Through collateralized reward-bearing assets, particularly LSTs, users can compound their yields and benefit from DeFi composability. The protocol redistributes DUSD yield and incentives to stakers, lenders, and liquidity providers, amplifying the benefits and utility of LST tokens within the ecosystem. Community-driven governance by DGT token holders plays a vital role in decision-making and voting.


**Motivation:**
Davos Protocol leverages its yield generation mechanisms to redistribute the generated yield as incentives, commonly referred to as “bribes,” to the DEX pool. To streamline this process and improve efficiency, the protocol proposes for a gauge to be in place that enables direct distribution of these incentives. As the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the pool increases, the pool receives a larger portion of incentives from Davos Protocol. This incentivizes the pool to become the primary liquidity source for the DUSD omnichain stablecoin.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** 
Governance of the Davos Protocol is facilitated through DGT, granting holders the power to vote on protocol changes. DGT holders can propose and vote on modifications, ensuring democratic decision-making. Changes approved by the voters won’t take effect immediately, safeguarding the system against potentially harmful proposals. The Global Davos Council (GDC) is a council consisting of co-founders and advisors. The GDC serves as a governing body, providing guidance and expertise.

2. **Oracles:** 
As of now, the protocol does not rely on or utilize any oracles.

3. **Audits:**

https://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts/blob/main/audits/SlowMist_310523.pdf

4. **Centralization vectors:** 
DUSD operates as a decentralized stablecoin and the protocol is currently managed by the core team, but the Governance Token (DGT) and veDGT model will be released to enable community governance. Liquidation can be performed by any individual.

5. **Market History:**
 https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/davos-protocol/
 
6. **Value:** 
The pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token.

## Title: [ARFC] OP Risk Parameters Update for Aave V3 Optimism Pool

## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative

## Date: 2023-08-25

---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the activation of OP as a borrowable asset in the Aave V3 Optimism pool. The aim is to adapt to the maturity of the L2 and attract more suppliers and borrowers, thereby generating new revenue for the protocol.

## Motivation

The Aave OP V3 market is one of the Aave V3 L2 deployments, with OP being the native asset of the OP L2. At its inception, the L2 was in its early stages, leading to the onboarding of OP with conservative parameters due to nascent liquidity & infrastructure. 

As the L2 has matured, the ACI proposes less conservative parameters for the OP asset. By removing the isolation mode for OP and allowing its borrowing, we anticipate attracting more suppliers who can earn a yield on their OP deposits and new borrowers who can use OP to borrow additional assets. This will also generate new revenue for the protocol. 

While the proposed changes are less conservative, they still maintain strict supply, borrow caps, and a conservative interest rate strategy. This ensures that the DAO promotes growth and new opportunities while remaining risk-averse. Based on the collected market data post-implementation, the community will have the opportunity to revisit these parameters at a later stage.

## Specification

- **Asset**: OP
- **OP Contract Address**: [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042)

The DZAR peg to ZAR (fiat currency) is kept at voluntary efforts of Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd. and the pegging can be terminated at any point in time at discretion of Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd.""

DZAR can print unlimited amounts of tokens at their sole discretion.

DZAR gets pooled in many 8 asset pools. These pools are as safe as the weakest currency, DZAR going to 0 will drain these pools to 0. There are millions in these pools. If DZAR prints unlimited amount of tokens, it will drain all these pools, generate large losses and bad publicity.

I think that encouraging DZAR liquidity on Balancer creates a big risk for potential liquidity providers joining these pools.",bullish

**Protocol Description:**

See here: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708

Centered around [@BalancerLabs](https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs)’s veBAL, Aura coordinates incentives around vote-escrowed tokens to boost yield potential and governance power of DeFi liquidity providers, governance token stakers and voters.

**Motivation:**

The synergies between Balancer and Aura are widely known. The approval of this gauge for the auraBAL/(8020 BAL/ETH BPT) pool will set Aura up for a successful launch period and continue to provide deep liquidity for auraBAL in the years to come.

10% of Aura's total AURA supply is being directed to the Chef contract (0x1ab80F7Fb46B25b7e0B2cfAC23Fc88AC37aaf4e9) over 4-5 years. This flow can be diverted to provide additional rewards on top of the existing BAL & AURA that will be received as part of the natural Gauge deposits. It will also give Aura the opportunity to use this allocation to bribe voters and fuel the secondary market developing around veBAL voting.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.

No

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

Aura is a non custodial, non pausable platform.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

No historical volume, however rewards are likely to flow soon and liquidity develop.

## Summary

The Balancer DAO has locked its vested AURA into vlAURA with [[BIP-481]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-481-claim-and-lock-balancer-dao-aura-allocation-into-vlaura/5319). The second lock of 1.74m AURA will expire and can be relocked after June 27th and before the unlock date of July 4th, 2024:

 
![vlAura.png](ipfs://bafkreihdvdnzfszhe7tmwnhhha7qmgnerpfmh52h7fxdeyihj3n5ox2hjm)
    

The DAO wishes to relock its current position and bundle it with an additional vest so the next unlock is bundled into one in 16 weeks from the relock date as done previously in [[BIP-551]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-551-claim-and-relock-balancer-daos-aura-vlaura/5588).

## Motivation

The Balancer DAO wishes to relock its vlAURA position to continue to vote for Balancer gauges with its position. To do so the DAO needs to relock its expired position timely after June 27th and before July 4th 2024

At the time of writing, the DAO is entitled again to roughly ~255k AURA tokens (can be verified by calling `available` with `_recipient` as `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` https://etherscan.io/address/0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422 ). Another ~5-10k AURA remains unvested and will be claimed at a later date.

We are proposing to initiate another lock with the available ~255k AURA to be used to vote on AURA governance. The specifics of the Balancer DAOs voting allocations can be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-508-utilize-locked-aura-to-support-ecosystem-growth/5419).

By re-locking the initial position and vesting additional AURA between June 27th and July 4th which would fall into the same locking epoch, it is guaranteed that the entirety of the locks will be up for re-lock in 16 weeks, reducing load on the multi-sig, streamlining the management of this position.

## Specification

The Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the vlAURA contract at `0x3fa73f1e5d8a792c80f426fc8f84fbf7ce9bbcac` and call `processExpiredLocks` with argument `true` - The execution needs to be timed AFTER June 27th and BEFORE July 4th

Additionally, the DAO multisig on mainnet `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call the `claim` function on the AuraVestedEscrow at `0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422` with the parameter `_lock` set to `true`. This execution, as well as the above, needs to be timed AFTER June 27th and BEFORE July 4th",neutral
516,"## Summary

A proposal to whitelist Connext, a trust minimized cross chain protocol, for V3 Portals on 6 chains: Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony - with credit lines for USDC ($2m on each chain), USDT ($1m on each chain) and ETH (40 ETH on each chain).

## Reasonale

[Connext](https://connext.network) is a network for **fast, trustless communication between chains and rollups**. It is the only interoperability system of its type that does this cheaply and quickly without introducing any new trust assumptions. Connext is aimed at developers who are looking to build bridges and other natively **cross-chain applications**.
To date, over $1.3b in transactions have crossed the network.

Our network of liquidity providers only works with native assets, or the most canonical representation of a wrapped asset.

With our [Amarok upgrade](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4), a series of improvements are coming for users, developers and liquidity providers (routers): the latest will be tasked with providing capital upfront to the users, while getting refunded within 30 minutes when the slower confirmation, coming from the [Optimistic communication protocol Nomad](https://blog.connext.network/optimistic-bridges-fb800dc7b0e0), is completed.

Users’ transactions get confirmed in seconds, LPs get rewarded with a fee on the transaction for their service.

**Portals are therefore a perfect match for Connext as our LPs will need and want to access immediate extra liquidity to fulfill transactions, and our new architecture allows for this operation to be completed via the protocol in a trust minimized way**.

## Technical Specifications

Connext is much more than a bridge, it’s an **interoperability protocol**: it allows to build cross chain applications without adding trust assumptions.
One of these applications are bridges, others could be cross chain NFTs marketplaces or cross chain governance portals.

**51 routers are currently providing $40m+ of liquidity.**
The highly capital efficient architecture of Connext allows for higher volume (and therefore higher returns) with less capital compared to other solutions in the space.
The system is currently working on a whitelist basis. Once the [NEXT token](https://blog.connext.network/whats-next-d3044de49397) is live, the whole network will be permissionless.

## How does it work?

This is an overview of the Amarok architecture that is currently on testnet and planned to go live in a few weeks:

![image](ipfs://QmZVvSsU5ra6vFvMiu82iMAieP1LFuS44EjsbLJVkeUj8N)

The new flow heavily utilizes Nomad (and eventually other localized messaging layers) for its security model. Routers front capital and execute calls for a user’s transaction, and claim against funds going through Nomad.


A full overview can be found [here](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4).

This model fits with the Aave Portals. This is how the simplified architecture integrating Portals will look like - credits to Delphi Digital for the image.

([Development progress deep dive](https://github.com/connext/nxtp/pull/1074)).

The logic for the execute and reconcile methods for the Aave portals has been completed and is ready for audit.

#### Is there a fee model for participants?
LPs currently take a 5bps fee from every transaction

Analytics dashboard of Connext: https://connextscan.io

Bridge for users: https://bridge.connext.network

Technical documentation: https://docs.connext.network

## Proposed list Credit Line request

The credit lines are requested for the following networks where both Connext and Aave are already present.

Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony

![aave.png](ipfs://QmbxAKskwg6caRq4j9ogFUA5xUqmHSLmT8WU8mwXbJdg56)

Note: Routers providers are charging 5 bps to complete cross chain transactions.
All outstanding loans are repaid within 60 min (avg 30 min), effectively paying a high interest rate: 0.005% / 60 min → 44% APR

#### Incentives
A Liquidity Mining program might be approved by the DAO once the NEXT token goes live.

    • Communities [Telegram](https://t.me/DFX_Finance), [Discord](https://discord.dfx.finance/)

**Protocol Description:**

> DFX Finance is a decentralized foreign exchange (FX) protocol that facilitates the seamless exchange of fiat-backed stablecoins denominated in a growing number of currencies. Using a hyper-efficient AMM, optimized for low volatility trading, DFX provides FX swaps with rates that will beat any bank, money changer, or FX platform. DFX Pools currently have over $40M in TVL. DFX is the governance token of DFX Finance which allows users to vote on protocol changes and initiatives of the DAO, and also allows users to receive boosted emissions on deposits within the DFX ecosystem.

**Price History DFX:**

>Price History for DFX can be found on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dfx-finance)

**Motivation:**

> The DFX/ETH 50/50, and DFX/TEL/USDC 40/40/20, needs incentivization to migrate meaningful amounts of liquidity over to the Balancer ecosystem, and to bring higher trading volumes to Balancer. As well, DFX Finance is committed to engage in the Hiddenhand Finance ecosystem in a meaningful way to further deepen DFX liquidity onchain.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** DFX tokens serve as the governance token for the DFX Finance protocol. DFX token holders can vote on governance proposals through DFX’s snapshot. DFX forum is also used to discuss potential protocol changes and improvements.DFX Finance also has plans to transition to a veDFX model to further improve on decentralizing governance of the protocol.   

2. **Oracles:** DFX token does not rely on any external oracles. The DFX stablecoin pools uses Chainlink for its real world forex price feeds to facilitate efficient stablecoin swaps close to the spot price. The feeds can be found here: [Decentralized Price Reference Data | Chainlink](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/fiat)

3. **Audits:** DFX has engaged with multiple auditors including engagements with Trail of Bits, Haechi, and Zellic to audit the DFX smart contracts.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Treasury functions are controlled by a 2/4 multisig including treasury yield farming, and paying bribes.

5. **Market History:** DFX has been transferable since March 2021. The oldest DFX pool on Balancer is 230 days old, with the highest daily volume of $4M. There is currently $420,000 worth of DFX liquidity on Balancer.

520,"## Summary

Proposal for the full deprecation of stable rate mode from Aave v2 and v3, with all user positions being swapped to variable.

## Motivation

On the 4th of November 2023 6, a report was received via the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty program about a critical bug related to the stable borrow rate.

Only certain assets were affected due to their configuration, but given the nature of the bug, together with the progressive deprecation of stable rate that started before (not enabled in Aave v3 Ethereum, the main instance of Aave at the moment, or any other afterwards), the fix involved a full deprecation of minting mechanisms of stable debt: halting new borrowings in that mode and also halting rebalancing and swapping from variable to stable.


Even if with the halting of minting of stable rate we are fully confident that there is no further vector, the current situation is extremely asymmetric, and creating really important technical overhead, for example when doing security evaluations/reviews of the protocol: there are user positions at stable, which factually have fixed rate until they decide to close it, without any kind of rebalancing applicable.

Additionally, and even if we know with full certainty that it is not applicable anymore, we are not comfortable disclosing how was the attack vector reported in November until all user stable debt positions are closed.

Therefore, after evaluating the scenario for some time, we think the better solution is to progress on the deprecation of stable rate, by having all user positions at stable moved to variable.

## Specification

The Pool smart contract on both Aave v2 and v3 has a function `swapBorrowRateMode()`, originally allowing for an user to swap his own borrow mode from stable to variable and vice versa, and after the bug report, only allowing the user to swap from stable to variable.

With one of the swap directions not available anymore, this function becomes factually a mechanism of off-boarding from stable rate to variable. However, in some cases, for lack of monitoring of the positions, and in others, because it is not profitable, multiple users have stayed in stable rate mode, not swapping to variable.

The proposal consists in an update to the Aave Pool and its affected libraries to make the `swapBorrowRateMode()` permission-less (technical details apart) in order to allow any address to trigger a swap of rate from variable to stable.

This will allow, for example, an Aave DAO automation to swap all current stable debt positions to variable, without any type of penalty to the users, apart from losing their stable exposure (sometimes positive for them, sometimes negative, if compared with the current variable rate).

As no new positions with stable rate can be created, this will allow for the final off-boarding of the mode, once all positions are at variable.",neutral

Launched in 2021 after years of open-source R&D, Cronos is #9 public blockchain by DeFi value locked according to  [Defillama](https://defillama.com/chains)  (around 2.5 B$ TVL to date). Cronos proposes to deploy Aave V3 to the Cronos chain and to incentivize liquidity in order to help fulfill the promise of a multi-chain future.

Cronos is the first Ethereum-compatible blockchain network built on Cosmos SDK technology. An open-source Layer 1 chain launched under the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  umbrella, Cronos aims to massively scale the DeFi and dApp (Web3) user community by providing builders with the ability to instantly port apps and crypto assets from other chains while benefiting from low transaction fees, high throughput, and fast finality.

In 2020 and 2021, hundreds of millions of consumers have purchased their first cryptos, the majority via a centralized exchange. Tens of millions of them already have a connection with the strategic partners of the Cronos project: as [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  customers, as holders of CRO or other tokens of the Cosmos ecosystem, and/or as [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  project supporters. These crypto users are now eager to take the next step in Web3. For them, Cronos is a natural gateway into the broader world of self-custody, Ethereum and DeFi.

The cross-chain future that is such an integral part of Aave V3, resonates well with the motivations of Cronos users. Therefore, Cronos represents an ideal ground to demonstrate the promise of Aave V3.

**Technical specifications of the network**

*Network specifications*

[Cronos](https://cronos.crypto.org/)  is an open-source project launched by  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  that brings together many  [open-source initiatives](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/blob/main/go.mod#L22)  of the Ethereum, Cosmos and IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) ecosystems. At its core, it is a fully EVM-compatible alternative Layer 1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK (Ethermint implementation).

Cronos mainnet has been live since November 2021 and is already home to more than 120 partners and more than 340,000 DeFi and NFT users. Cronos is powered by the CRO cryptocurrency, which counts tens of millions of holders and users worldwide thanks to its support by  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) . All key network statistics can be viewed on the Etherscan deployment, called  [Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/charts)  , as well as on  [Defillama for TVL data](https://defillama.com/chain/Cronos)  .

At the protocol level, Cronos relies on a Proof of Authority consensus where each validator’s voting power is proportional to their stake in the protocol’s staking token. There are currently 26 live validators, with room for more. The consensus delivers fast finality with block times between 5 and 6 seconds, low transaction fees (usually below 1 USD) paid in CRO token, and small environmental footprint.

Users and Dapp developers interact with Cronos primarily through the usual EVM Web3 JSON-RPC  [endpoints](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  . They can deploy any EVM-compatible smart contract written in Solidity, and can use all the usual end-user and developer tooling: MetaMask, Etherscan block explorer ([Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/) ), Gnosis Safe, Truffle, Hardhat, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Web3.py, etc.

The Cronos team is actively in contact with the relevant teams to implement all the components needed for robust Aave V3 deployment and operations, specifically the Chainlink oracle, The Graph indexer, and commercial and JSON-RPC endpoints for Dapps (in addition to the existing  [free ones](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  ). These teams are in process of assigning engineering resources to work on these project. A likely target launch date for these additional components is early Q2 2022. Cronos protocol engineering resources stand ready to support these projects.

There are several bridges between Cronos and other networks :

* [Live] Fast withdrawals from and to the  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  app and exchange.
* [Upcoming] Native bridge from and to the Ethereum mainnet via Gravity Bridge technology, currently in testing and planned for imminent launch.
* [Live] IBC transfers from and to the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  chain, Cosmos Hub, and Terra, with more IBC-compatible chains on the roadmap.
* [Live] EVM smart contract-based transfers from and to BSC, Polygon, and other EVM chains via 3 independent bridges, with more to come.
* Security review of additional bridges is under way.

Cronos is an open ecosystem supported by a wide range of more than 120  [contributors](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  ,  [validators](https://cronos.crypto.org/partners)  , and  [Dapp developers](https://cronos.crypto.org/ecosystem)  . This includes 2 large AMM/DEXes, VVS Finance (1.4 B$ TVL) and MM Finance (320 M$ TVL).

The  [roadmap](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-chain-journey-so-far-and-2022-roadmap-3475abbe6254)  is ambitious and includes protocol and database optimizations, further connectivity and interoperability, best-in-class tooling and infrastructure, further protocol governance decentralization, dozens of DeFi and GameFi Dapps, and longer term plans to increase scalability.

*Aave V3 implementation*

As part of this proposal, Aave V3 will be deployed to Cronos like any Web3 protocol, given that Cronos is fully EVM-compatible. Aave operations will rely on the Chainlink oracle and The Graph indexer (implementation under way).

The Aave V3 Portal will be able to leverage robust EVM-based cross-chain bridges (such as Connext and others, subject to further testing and security review) for the transfer of underlying assets backing aTokens.

*Metrics and references*

Chain data as of Feb 15, 2022:
* 26 live validators.
* 15+ M transactions to date (no transaction pumping!)
* 150,000 to 200,000 transactions per day, with potential to increase by 5x to 20x in the short term.
* 350,000 unique wallets.
* More than 120 Dapps deployed in the last 3 months, including VVS (DEX, 1.4 B$ TVL), MM Finance (DEX, 320 M$ TVL), Tectonic (decentralized lending, 275 M$ TVL), and others.

**Proposed list of initial collaterals**

The proposed list of initial collaterals is: CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, ATOM, LUNA, DOT.

As indicated above, Chainlink price feeds are being scheduled for deployment.

Cronos already supports the  [following cross-chain assets](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#integration-guide-for-cronos-mainnet-beta)  : CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, SHIB, DOGE, ATOM, LINK, ENJ, ELON, TUSD, LUNA, DOT, BIFI, with more to come. Additional native tokens include VVS, TONIC. These tokens have between 10 M$ and 700 M$ of liquidity on Cronos. Daily volume for the corresponding pairs is between 20 and 30 M$.

The proposed tokens have more than, or close to, 2 M$ daily volume each. With respect to DEX statistics, see  [VVS analytics](https://vvs.finance/info)  for history and liquidity per token.

**Incentives**

Particle B, the Web3 accelerator of the Cronos chain, has an initial allocation of USD 100 million in CRO tokens for ecosystem development. A portion of these funds will be allocated to end-user incentives, commensurate with the large user and TVL growth potential of Aave V3 on Cronos.

In our experience, the effectiveness of liquidity mining incentives varies depending on market conditions, hence the exact programs and amounts (expected to be worth several M$) will need to be refined over time.

**Audits and security**

Cronos mainnet was launched in November 2021 and has not experienced outages so far.

An audit of relevant components of the underlying Ethermint codebase (  [crypto](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/crypto)  ,  [JSON RPC](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/ethereum/rpc)  ,  [Ante handler](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/app)  ,  [EVM state transition](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/blob/main/x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go)  ) was commissioned by Foris Ltd and completed by Kudelski Security. It is published in the Cronos Github repository ([link](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/tree/main/docs/audit)).

A bug bounty program is  [published](https://immunefi.com/bounty/cronos/)  , with a bounty of up to 1.3 M$.

523,"Summary

This proposal outlines a strategic approach to reduce XVS emissions by 59%, from 501.96 daily emissions to 204.74.

Details
Considerations: All market values are taken from January 5, 2024.

Current market status:

Table 1: Market Status
 
![image](ipfs://bafybeiegu3y6hbaycq7x5byvlwwv3qac3ro2reyw6qwvkpwjvqgczdvqem)
    
Rating System:
The rating system combines two critical factors:

- TVL Rating: Lower ratings for higher TVL, indicating a conservative approach to emission reduction in markets with high TVL.

- High (1 Point): Markets with a combined supply and borrow TVL exceeding $100 million.

- Moderate (2 Points): Markets with a combined TVL between $20 million and $100 million.

- Low (10 Points): Markets with a combined TVL under $20 million.
Sensitivity Rating: Based on the proportion of emissions in supply and borrow yield. Markets with low sensitivity are recommended for more aggressive reduction.

- Low Sensitivity (4 Points): Emission proportion in supply and borrow APY below 10%.

- Moderate Sensitivity (2 Points): Emission proportion ranging from 10% to 30%.

- High Sensitivity (1 Point): Emission proportion exceeding 30%.

Considerations:

- Markets with a TVL below $20 million (e.g., BCH, AAVE, TUSD) will take a value of 10 in the TVL rating as they are considered negligible in their contribution to protocol reserves and are recommended for complete emission elimination.

- VAI will be treated differently as it requires emissions to incentivize its use and staking.

Table 2: Rating system per market


![image](ipfs://bafybeihvo3akfnqle2hme4ngxj3t3v4rrndhkxi26qqaouuwx55yet7cg4)
    
    
Suggested changes:

- In markets with high TVL but low sensitivity, like USDT, USDC, and CAKE, there is an opportunity for a more aggressive emission reduction of 75%.

- A 50% reduction is proposed for major assets like BTCB, BNB, and ETH to balance market importance with emission control.

- For assets with low TVL, such as ADA, XRP, and LINK, a complete emission reduction is recommended due to their minimal impact on protocol reserves.

- VAI emissions will be reduced by 50% to maintain attractive incentives and staking yields for users.

Table 3: Proposed emission changes
 
![image](ipfs://bafybeicfmxwd2yfyup2lfm7dmrhd2pluzvebauurmzxazyizaqnageoir4)

Conclusion:

The proposed emission reductions are calculated to protect significant markets. The dual-factor rating system ensures both the market size and its sensitivity to emission changes are considered to evaluate the specific reduction amount per market. Ultimately, we expect to lower the total daily emissions from around 502 XVS to 205 XVS, achieving a significant 59% overall reduction.",neutral

### [TEMP CHECK]  Deploy an Etherfi/Stablecoin Aave v3 Instance 
### Author: ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)
###  Date: 2024-07-05

---

## Summary:
This proposal suggests deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on providing liquidity for weETH holders to borrow stablecoins.

## Motivation
The demand for borrowing wETH on Aave using weETH as collateral is extremely high, with caps being filled within minutes each week.

While this $2B growth is welcomed and responsible for ~$12.5M yearly revenue (at current ETH prices) for the DAO, it has created some frustration for significant users looking to borrow stablecoins using their weETH as collateral.

With this asset being constantly at cap, users are wary of leveraging Aave for this use case as they have legitimate concerns about their ability to add more collateral/debt to (de)leverage following market conditions.

To provide weETH holders with more suitable options, we propose creating a dedicated weETH/stablecoin Aave v3 Instance. 

This market also lays the groundwork for future integrations & synergies with EtherFi's Cash product.

## Specification

The proposed weETH/Stablecoin Aave v3 instance will implement the following:

- The market will include weETH, USDC, and a new GHO facilitator.

This GHO facilitator will be one of the highest quality collateral having only an eth-correlated asset as collateral.

- This market will not have E-Mode, but due to its focused nature and limitation of cross-collaterals, it's proposed to have a higher LTV/LT status for weETH than for the main instance.

- For the first 6 months, the GHO borrow rate will be slightly lower than on the main Aave instance to kickstart liquidity & boost demand.
 
The risk steward will dynamically adjust weETH supply caps based on stablecoin liquidity to ensure stablecoin borrowing remains viable.

- The GHO stewards will maintain the Exposure and borrow caps of this new GHO facilitator to keep tight control on GHO peg & liquidity.

In addition, we propose that the Aave DAO consider the following:

- Introduce a stablecoin deposit incentive program to kickstart stablecoin liquidity in this new instance using Merit or other initiatives to be discussed.

The deployment will be handled by Catapulta on behalf of the Aave DAO.

## Disclaimer

The ACI has not been compensated by Etherfi for the publication of this proposal.

The ACI and several ACI team members are both weETH and ETHFI holders.

## Next Steps
1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2. If the Snapshot outcome is Yae, escalate to the ARFC stage.
3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.
4. If the ARFC snapshot passes, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement.

Title: [ARFC] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market 
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-26

---

# **Summary**
This proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. 

### **Motivation**

Artemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.

artMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).

artMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.

### Benefits of listing artMETIS

We believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.

- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.
- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.
- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.
- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.

### Chain to be deployed/listed

artMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.

Ticker: artMETIS

Contract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)

Chainlink Oracle: 0x96C4A48Abdf781e9c931cfA92EC0167Ba219ad8E

### Specification

Risk Parameters have been provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Isolation Mode | No |
| Borrowable | Yes |
| Collateral Enabled | Yes |
| Supply Cap  | 15,000 |
| Borrow Cap | 1,500 |
| Debt Ceiling | - |
| LTV | 30.00% |
| LT | 40.00% |
| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |
| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |
| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |

| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |
| Uoptimal | 45.00% |
| Flahloanable | Yes |
| Siloed Borrowing | No |
| Borrowed in Isolation | No |


### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:

The Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.

Furthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.

Artemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.

In recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.

In summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.

529,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust three (3) total risk parameters including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across two (2) Aave V2 assets. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). 

## Specification


The past two weeks saw slight decreases in volatility. However, there were also decreases in liquidity and trading volume. Our simulations show that increasing borrow parameters across a wide array of assets could introduce significantly more risk in the short term. The below recommendations drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining risk at safe levels.


| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| FEI Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |
| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |


See below volatility and exchange volume data from 02/10 to 02/24. These are useful metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. 

|Symbol| 02-24 Volatility| 02-10 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| DPI    | 0.767483446      | 0.952875317     | -0.185391871      | 4.8907976   |
| FEI    | 0.05450812       | 0.072266895     | -0.017758775      | -41.5184138 |




## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. 

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

Proposal to add support for MAI (aka miMatic) on Aave V3 (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche)

### Summary

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom. It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.

All accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.

There’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.

### Risk Parameters

* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain

### Specifications

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Core team at QiDao Protocol.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.

MAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.

Despite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.

MAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.

3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
Being the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.

MAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.

MAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.
* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance
* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.

5. How is the asset currently used?

* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)
* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap
* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon
* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM
* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties
* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave

6. Emission schedule

Users can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.

7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

All funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users
There is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences
The multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.
Since the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.

8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

* Market Cap: ~$250M

533,"PR with payload: https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/37

### Motivation

The TransitionMigrator migrates all permissions granted after the deployment of the TimelockAuthorizer (in block 16085047) until Jan 25th 2023 (block 16484500). Some of these permissions have delays (notably `GaugeController.add_gauge` , which was granted to `GaugeAdderV3` ), so these are instead scheduled to be granted in the future.The deployment script verified that all roles that the migrator grants already existed (see [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/scripts/20230130-ta-transition-migrator/index.ts#L15)), and the migrator itself also checks this on-chain (see [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/governance-scripts/contracts/TimelockAuthorizerTransitionMigrator.sol#L81)).Finally, some temporary permissions are not re-granted, such as the root permission given to the GaugeAdderMigrationCoordinator (see [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/scripts/20230130-ta-transition-migrator/input/mainnet.ts#L141)).

Once this is executed, the transition to the timelock authorizer is complete and the 14 day timelock to enable the Gauge Adder v3 begins. 

Transition migrator address: 0x76578ecf9a141296Ec657847fb45B0585bCDa3a6 (confirmed [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/scripts/20230130-ta-transition-migrator/output/mainnet.json))

### Specification

The governance multisig must call `manageGranter` on the `TimelockAuthorizer` at `0x9E3cD0606Db55ac68845bB60121847823712ae05`, with arguments:

* actionId: `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`
* account: `0x76578ecf9a141296Ec657847fb45B0585bCDa3a6` (the migrator)
* where: `0xFFfFfFffFFfffFFfFFfFFFFFffFFFffffFfFFFfF` (stand in for 'everywhere')
* allowed: `true`

This will make the migrator a granter over all permissions in all contracts, allowing it to re-grant the old permissions and complete the migration. Once it is done, the migrator will renounce this privilege

Note that this must happen *after* the TimelockAuthorizer migration is complete. Otherwise, the governance multisig will not yet be the root account of the new system, and will not be authorized to call `manageGranter`",bullish

535,"#### ABSTRACT

Creating a home for the ApeCoin community within the tokenproof mobile app will help increase community participation, enable member onboarding, highlight community projects, and further incentivize ownership of ApeCoin by securing dedicated mobile real estate to distribute news, content, and experiences offered to community members.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

The integration of a dedicated ApeCoin Community Hub within the tokenproof app promises a number of benefits to the ApeCoin Ecosystem:

- **Enhanced Community Engagement**: By aggregating information, news, and opportunities, the hub will act as a catalyst for more active participation among ApeCoin holders. This can lead to higher voting rates for proposals and a more vibrant, engaged community.
- **Increased Awareness and Onboarding**: The hub will serve as a centralized platform for ApeCoin holders to learn about the various benefits, projects, and initiatives. This can lead to greater involvement from holders who may have been previously unaware or passive.
- **Boost in ApeCoin Projects**: A dedicated section for ApeCoin projects will provide them with the visibility they need, enabling them to gain traction and support from the community. This not only helps these projects flourish but also strengthens the overall ApeCoin ecosystem.
- **Consolidated Communication Channel**: The hub will act as a one-stop-shop for all things ApeCoin, reducing the need for holders to juggle between various platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Snapshot. This streamlining can lead to better information dissemination and more coherent community discussions.
- **Incentivized Ecosystem Growth**: The hub can also act as a platform for collaborations, partnerships, and joint ventures between different ApeCoin projects. This fosters an environment of mutual growth and collaboration within the ApeCoin ecosystem.

#### OVERALL COST

If the AIP is approved and funding secured, $80,000 USD (in its $APE equivalent) would be reserved and awarded incrementally upon delivery of the aforementioned capabilities, and according to funding schedule above. The funds obtained in this AIP will provide the ability to finance the development of the initial scope, support, bug fixes, minor updates, and maintenance costs for the duration of the AIP.

As outlined in the [new whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the AMPL capFactor from cap1 to cap2 ($1M -> $3M).

**The Proposal**

This is a proposal to increase the AMPL cap tier from cap1 to cap2. AMPL currently has ~$3.4M in liquidity, well above the $1M level.

Ampleforth has developed a Smart Pool that updates weights each day with supply changes to reduce impermanent loss normally incurred by LPs on other decentralized exchange platforms. This AMPL/USDC pool currently has $6.5M of liquidity.

**What is AMPL?**
Ampleforth is a digital currency with an elastic supply that adjusts each day according to demand in the marketplace. The protocol effectively seeks to shift volatility from price to supply. The supply can shift dramatically over time, while the price stays within a band around the price target of the 2019 US Dollar.",bearish

## Summary

The community would like to ask for your support in listing sAVAX as a collateral asset. sAVAX is the Liquid Staking token from BENQI protocol.

## Motivation

sAVAX is a Liquid Staking token that allows a user to unlock liquidity while participating in securing the Avalanche network. As sAVAX constantly increases in value from network validation reward, listing sAVAX would allow users to unlock liquidity as a collateral for loans and in turn generate revenue to AAVE. Revenue in the form of sAVAX will always grow from the said network validation reward.

sAVAX is the largest Liquid Staking token on Avalanche and has over 3M sAVAX in circulation with deep liquidity in AMMs to support a healthy lending market ecosystem.

## Specifications

#### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
The author of the AIP is a representative of the BENQI team.

#### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
BENQI Liquid Staking solution that allows a user to stake AVAX to receive sAVAX. AVAX that is staked will then be delegated to nodes to run network validation that generates approx 7.20% APR.

sAVAX can be redeemed back for AVAX after a 15 days cooldown period in a 2 days redemption window. If unredeemed, the sAVAX will be restaked into the protocol and continue to secure the network, generating reward and can be unstaked again at any time after.

#### Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
sAVAX is a yield bearing asset as validation reward is accrued and realised upon redemption for AVAX. Using a yield bearing asset as a collateralised asset would increase the interest earned on supplying and reduce the cost of borrowing.

As sAVAX has multiple integrations with Anchor, Kyber, Trader Joe, Ribbon and Platypus, we expect to see sAVAX being borrowed to facilitate some of these use cases for borrowing.

#### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

BENQI started off as the first lending protocol on Avalanche when there were few builders on the network when it first launched in 2020. Identifying a need for a base layer of DeFi primitive, BENQI’s lending protocol was officially launched in 2021.

As DeFi activity on the Avalanche network grew, it was ripe to support another layer of DeFi primitive, Liquid Staking. With over 270m AVAX ($21 bn) staked in the P-chain (platform chain where validating nodes live), there is a great opportunity for users to participate in securing the network and receiving validation rewards and use sAVAX as collateral on AAVE.

#### How is the asset currently used?
There is over 3M AVAX (~ $200M) being staked via BENQI and over $100M of liquidity across AMMs. sAVAX is integrated by protocols such as Anchor, Platypus, Ribbon Finance, More Money, Trade Joe, Kyber and Pangolin.

#### Emission schedule
No emission schedule

#### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?
sAVAX cannot be minted without staking AVAX in the contract. A multisig is currently the owner of the minting contract of BENQI’s core team.

As delegation requires an EOA, sAVAX’s delegating EOA ownership is in the process of being transitioned to a MPC (multi-party computation) model that decentralizes the process of delegating AVAX to nodes.

Number of holders: 4070 holders

## Technical Specifications

sAVAX uses a pool share system in which the token increases in value due to the increasing AVAX balance in the pool. Staked AVAX is withdrawn from the C-chain smart contract and imported into the P-chain for delegation. The withdrawal and delegation process is currently protected in a hardened memory-only runtime environment with no remote access and extremely restricted physical access. AVAX is delegated to reputable validators randomly to ensure reliable performance and validation rewards. When delegations expire, the rewards are added to the pool and redelegated alongside the principal amount to compound rewards.

The architecture is currently transitioning into a distributed, multi-party computational system which ensures that the private key of the off-chain bot is not known to any entity at any time. For transactions to be executed, multiple wardens must be in consensus regarding the transaction validity, and the wardens have to sign the transactions independently using their own keys. Only when all wardens agree and have signed the transactions can the final transaction be constructed for execution.

It is suggested that the AIP only be implemented once the transition is complete.",bullish

541,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust six (6) total risk parameters including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. In addition, Gauntlet recommends freezing legacy KNC. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

## Specification


Our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. 

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| DAI Loan To Value     | 75%     | 77%     |
| LINK Liquidation Bonus     | 6.5%     | 6.3%     |
| LINK Liquidation Threshold    | 75%     | 78%     |
| USDC Loan To Value    | 82.5%     | 85.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Bonus    | 4.0%     | 4.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Threshold    | 85%     | 86%     |



See below volatility and exchange volume data from 03/17 to 03/31. These are useful metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. 

|Symbol| 03-31 Volatility| 03-17 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| DAI   | 	0.180079852     |  0.18048045   | 	-0.000400598   | 2.9325893   |
| LINK    |  0.77471859    |  1.054943327   | 	-0.280224737    | 26.950699 |
| USDC    |  0.029199586    |  0.031859885    | -0.002660299   |  3.1429237  |





## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. 

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

## Freezing Legacy KNC

The KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20/2021, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 3/28/2022, roughly 195M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdefa4e8a7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 57M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There are currently $2.9M KNCL supplied and $900K total borrowed on Aave v2.

Considering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.

546,"### Background
Per andy8052 on the [Uniswap forums](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-to-arbitrum-mainnet/12451):
...there is immense value in being available for swaps on every EVM compatible network. Since there is no liquidity mining, it is hard to make the case that multiple deployments will segment liquidity, and long term if this is an issue governance can flip the switch on liquidity incentives for the chains it desires deepest liquidity. In the meantime, not deploying to new and growing networks like Arbitrum and Matic just allows for other exchanges to come in and fill that spot. This could potentially eat into fees earned by governance in the future.

Alongside this, it will help to grow the potential list of projects that can be built on Uniswap v3. Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing with and using the v3 codebase will only expedite Uniswap adoption on all chains as the code and integrations become more battle tested.

Arbitrum launches later this week on May 28th. I think it would be best to start a discussion ASAP around deploying the Uniswap v3 code to Arbitrum network.

### Next Steps
Indicate your interest for Uniswap moving forward with a deployment of Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum, by (1) opening the Uniswap v3 license to include code deployed on Arbitrum, (2) allowing community developers to implement Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum.",bullish

550,"PR with payload: https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/35

### Motivation

As part of the ongoing process to transition to the timelock authorizer the Maxis have temporarily lost the ability to add gauges the traditional way. Once the migration to the new authorizer and to the Gauge Adder v3 is complete then that ability will be restored. We're currently targeting the end of February for this to be done. Until then, any new gauge must be added by the DAO Multisig directly. BIP 159 & 160 were not written with the specification required to do this. After communicating with the teams involved they desire to proceed immediately with the adding of their gauges rather than waiting another month. This proposal will add their already approved gauges directly from the DAO Multisig.

**It's also important to note that once we trigger the next stage of the Gauge Adder v3 migration there will be a 14 day window where no new gauges can be added by any method. This is expected to begin on Feb 13th or so.**

### Specification

This corresponds with the role for calling add_gauge on the gaugeController as seen here .

account: 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f

551,"Hello Balancer community, I’m Abdul and I lead BD for ecosystem at Monad Labs. I’m reaching out today with a proposal to deploy Balancer on the Monad blockchain.

**Introduction**

Monad is an upcoming high-performance EVM-equivalent L1 that introduces parallel EVM to enable 10,000 tps, 1-second block times and single-slot finality while preserving full bytecode EVM equivalence. Testnet launch is planned for Q2 and mainnet launch is planned for Q4 of this year.

Balancer’s current and upcoming products are an excellent fit for the emerging DeFi ecosystem of Monad. Balancer’s Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools will be able to capture significant opportunity as new projects emerge on Monad, while Balancer’s flexible support for advanced AMM pool behaviors, such as concentrated liquidity, boosted pools, and stable math, will benefit from the extremely low fees and high throughput of Monad’s parallel EVM.

We propose to deploy Balancer products on Monad at both testnet and mainnet launches, advancing the Balancer vision of democratizing DeFi innovation on a broad scale.

**Proposal**

This proposal seeks the backing of the Balancer community for the deployment of Balancer on both the Monad testnet and mainnet. Combining Balancer's distinctive features with Monad's high-performance EVM will be a significant unlock for developers and users.

Balancer’s flexibility, customizability, low slippage, and support for bootstrapping liquidity make it a perfect fit for Monad’s parallel & performant EVM architecture. Deploying Balancer on Monad prior to the mainnet launch will enhance Balancer’s position as a leading and innovative hub of DeFi activity.

**Timeline**

Should this proposal be approved, Monad contributors will collaborate with Balancer contributors to determine a deployment timeline that suits both Balancer and the respective Monad public testnet and mainnet launches.

**Summary**

The deployment of Balancer products on the Monad blockchain provides a unique opportunity for both the Balancer and Monad ecosystems. Deployment will bring advanced DeFi capabilities to the users of a fast-growing ecosystem, and will bring together two vibrant communities.

**About Monad**

Monad is a high-performance EVM-equivalent L1 blockchain, built with a focus on performance and written from scratch in C++ and Rust. Monad materially advances the efficient frontier in the tradeoff between decentralization and scalability through superscalar pipelining and parallelization.

Monad introduces optimizations in four major areas, resulting in a blockchain with throughput of 10,000 transactions per second:

* MonadBFT - custom high-performance, two-phased consensus mechanism derivative of Hotstuff
* Asynchronous Execution - decoupled execution runs in parallel to consensus rather than as a prerequisite
* Parallel Execution - optimistic execution of block transactions in parallel, akin to OCC and STM
* MonadDb - custom state database designed for optimal MPT-based reads and writes

Monad's improvements address existing bottlenecks while preserving seamless compatibility for application developers (full EVM bytecode compatibility) and users (Ethereum RPC API compatibility). As a result, the rich landscape of Ethereum tooling and applied cryptography research can plug seamlessly into Monad while benefiting from improved throughput and scale:

* applications (any dapp built for Ethereum)
* developer tooling (e.g. Hardhat, Apeworx, Foundry)
* wallets (e.g. MetaMask)
* analytics/indexing (e.g. Etherscan, Dune)

Further, the Monad community consists of a passionate group of builders, traders, creators that are excited about the continued growth and development of on-chain partnerships.

Additional resources on the team, technology, and community of Monad can be found here:

554,"Hooked Protocol is building the on-ramp layer for massive Web3 adoption, providing tailored Learn and Earn products and onboarding infrastructures for users and businesses to enter the new world of web3. 
With our pilot product Wild Cash offering Quiz-to-Earn and other gamified learning experiences, having attracted over 2 million members to the community, Hooked is aiming at forming an engaging ecosystem of community-owned economies by facilitating and optimizing the onboarding flows for all Web3 pathfinders. 
Hooked Protocol aims to build the on-ramp layer for massive Web3 adoption to form the ecosystem of future community-owned economies. We believe through gamified learning experience and paying out economic value back to our users, we can
empower everyone with no prior crypto experience to access, earn and own a share of crypto; 
enable and expediate developers and applications’ streamlined Web3 transformation;
form a vibrant community with scalability and engagements, leveraging decentralized social network and viral growth.
With such a growing community, Hooked Protocol can form an ecosystem of community-owned economies.
Despite the massive valuations of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other Cryptocurrencies, the huge gap between technology innovation and actual adoption is causing the crypto native realm to stagnate, when the lack of new users remains a critical and unresolved challenge to the whole industry, and the inadequacy of Web3 application abundance on chain diminishes industry prospects.
However, potentials for intrinsically dynamic modern virtual economy after covid are recognized and scaled up, leading to upsurging demands for trusted cooperation and sustainable economic model in Web3.
Being the on-ramp layer, Hooked is
targeting billions of Web2 internet users who can be onboarded to Web3;
building tailored products offering gamified experience to grow the community with massive user adoption and Web3 education;
integrating onboarding infrastructures for businesses on-ramp to Web3, to establish a cohesive ecosystem.
Hooked launched the pilot DApp, Wild Cash, in Q3 2022, as the Web3 community gateway in emerging markets and tailored to grow the community with massive user adoption based on viral growth and user Web3 transformation, achieved through gamified crypto learning experience and other built-in Web3 mechanics.
Hooked adopts a streamlined education system combined with immersive (experience-based) learning and inquisitive (curiosity-based) learning, including:
Gamified learning experience to impart web3 concepts with Quiz-to-Earn DApp Wild Cash;
Web3 emulation experience allowing users to participate in the crypto buzz sectors such as NFT and GameFi;
Innovative content including Hooked Academy short videos, community-formed DAOs, to enrich learning experience and reduce users’ learning curve in a fun and engaging way.
Quiz-to-Earn: Users get to start immersive Web3 learning and participate in the easiest way to learn Web3 knowledge while earning their first token prize by correctly answering quizzes.

PoWT (Proof of Work and Time) Mining Game: A game featured to incentivize users to contribute efforts and time within the platform, through the classic Proof-of-Work mechanism.

Social Referral: Users get to earn strong monetary rewards by simply sharing and establishing their Web3 social graph.

Stake and Swap: Users get to own their first crypto wallets and store crypto assets, and conduct staking, swap and transfer transactions with Hooked Wallet.
Being the Web3 community gateway, besides offering various intriguing incentives, Hooked equips users with a complete suite of Web3 onboarding solutions to facilitate their Web3 transformation as well.
Hooked Soulbound Token (Hooked SBT): Serving as the one and only digital identity, Hooked allows its community members to enter the Web3 realm with Hooked SBT, which is unique and useful for improving integrity and trust among community members. 
Hooked Wallet: First ever crypto wallet for most Hooked community members with user-friendly interface and infrastructure to store Web3 assets and conduct future transactions. 
On-chain protocol interactions: Hooked accumulates solid and substantial on-chain behaviour data by engaging all protocol interactions on BNB Chain, enabling extensive behavioural analysis and insights, and laying the foundation for community and ecosystem formation.
Leveraging a whole set of user-facing products under development and a unique decentralized social network, Hooked is forming a scalable and engaging community while also on its way to establishing an ecosystem of community-owned economies.
Contributed by growing decentralized KOC (Hooked users who successfully invite their social connections to join the Hooked community) nodes and edges, Hooked Decentralized User Growth Engine is fundamental to the organic growth and high engagement of Hooked community members, which, in turn, is essential to making effective and efficient massive Web3 user acquisition available for Hooked ecosystem applications.
As of November 2022, Hooked has more than 250,000 KOC nodes, with every 2 existing members bringing more than 1 new member to the community.
Aiming at onboarding developers and applications onto the world of Web3, Hooked is developing middlewares, including one-login DID solution, built-in wallet infrastructure, and social graph integrated interface etc., as the integrated onboarding system.
Rollup applicability as the base layer to consolidate all ecosystem assets and data, is another integral part of a fast and scalable blockchain infrastructure for Hooked to build, moving computational logic and data onto application rollup and eventually forming the Hooked ecosystem.
Achieving massive user adoption through gamified learning and onboarding developers and applications with powerful infrastructure, Hooked will provide a marketplace where individuals in the Hooked community are connected with applications/businesses, and resource allocation efficiency is maximized with consolidation of on-chain data and assets.
With all proposals completed and milestones achieved, Hooked will become the on-ramp layer for all Web3 pathfinders with a positive flywheel-based ecosystem of community-owned economies.
The tokenomics of any protocol can never be too emphasized as it reflects the value flowing within the ecosystem, while also containing both the psychological and behavioral forces that could affect the value and sustainability of the ecosystem in the long term.
Hooked prioritizes the precautions of coping with token price fluctuations, emphasizing both liquidity and utility while maintaining stability and ensuring long-term sustainability.
Hooked tokenomics adopts a segregation strategy by applying a single token (HOOK) oriented structure supplemented with an in-ecosystem only utility token (HGT - Hooked Gold Token), reflecting real value and enabling common use case functions, to avoid the scenario where pump and dump schemes happen.
HOOK: Governance token that reflects the value of the Hooked protocol ecosystem.
HGT (Hooked Gold Token): The in-ecosystem only utility token with which the community is constantly incentivized and motivated to make dynamic contributions.
uHGT (unlocked Hooked Gold Token): 
Token derived from the mechanism for managing the liquidity of HGT, combating speculation risks when a token’s price volatility could bring down reputation and value of the network.
Though HGT itself is non-liquidable, a community-driven and algorithm-adjusting unlocking mechanism of uHGT is applied to ensure a sustainable model.
HOOK is the only governance token with liquidity in the ecosystem, designed to reflect the value that flows across the Hooked platform with limited supply and scheduled emission scheme.
HOOK’s long term value is tied with the confidence people hold for the project but as opposed to HGT, supply of HOOK is fixed and designed to be deflationary.
HOOK token utilities are mostly built in for community governance, gas tokens for platform on-chain activities, staking incentives as holding rewards, social elements demonstrations with status signaling and individuality, and for more long-range objectives, valuable innovations contributing to the ecosystem thriving.
Governance platform token for Hooked ecosystem
One of the most fundamental utilities of HOOK will be community governance, representing stakes and votes in ecosystem proposals.
Gas token for Hooked Application Rollup
As we are building rollup infrastructure on top of L1s to support our DApp ecosystem, HOOK will be used as the gas token for all economic activities.
In the future, all DApps in the ecosystem built on top of Hooked platform will also be using HOOK as the gas token for on-chain transactions.
Access token for exclusive NFTs and privileges of community events
Community members will be motivated to hold tokens to get access to exclusive community events and grants to purchase limited editions of platform NFTs, which demonstrate community social status and network impacts.
Furthermore, HOOK will be put into innovation practices which overall benefit the ecosystem of both individual participants and businesses, ensuring considerable liquidity and token value will grow in direct proportion for the success of the whole community.

# Summary

* This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for pxETH/frxETH on Arbitrum.
* The underlying pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP). E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.
* The pool shall has a swap fee of 4 basis points, i.e., 0.04% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.

**Protocol Description:**

> pxETH is a liquid and fungible receipt token for ETH deposited into the Dinero protocol. pxETH is built on top of the Redacted DAO's Pirex platform and forms an integral part of Redacted’s Dinero protocol, a protocol which aims to vertically integrate ETH staking, block proposal and building, a RPC, leverage, and yield stripping into one synergistic ecosystem comprising pxETH, the Redacted Relayer RPC, and the DINERO stablecoin. pxETH provides users with a liquid and fungible tokenized staked ETH which benefits from Ethereum staking rewards and other revenue forms such as MEV tips and block rewards. Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).

In addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.

pxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.

The governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.

**Motivation:**

> Redacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.

An LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.

By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:

* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.

* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.

Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps 1

# Specifications

## Governance

The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.

## Oracles

No oracles are currently used.

## Audits

**Title:** [ARFC] Set Aave Chan Initiative as Emission Manager for sUSD on Aave V3 Optimism 
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-03-06

---

# **Summary**

This ARFC proposes to set the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) wallet as the emission manager for the sUSD token on Optimism Aave V3 market. This will enable the ACI to enact incentive programs funded by SNX ecosystem partners for all sUSD markets, promoting growth and expanding the user base of Aave on Optimism.

# Motivation

The Aave Chan Initiative has been in discussion with various parties that have a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of Aave V3 on Optimism. In order to facilitate emissions by various stakeholders, ACI proposes becoming the emissions manager for sUSD on Optimism. Emission incentives will be sent to ACI multisig and distributed as agreed on with partners. 

By setting the multisig as the emission manager for the sUSD token, the ACI will be able to directly manage incentive programs that can attract more users to the protocol and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets on Optimism.

# Specification

The ACI multisig address OP:0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd will be set as Emissions manager.

The call to the setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract will be as follows:

`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(sUSD, 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd);`

This method will set the ACI multisig as the emission admin for the sUSD token on Optimism Aave V3 market.

# Disclaimer

The Aave Chan Initiative is working with Synthetix to define the emissions program for sUSD. ACI has not been paid by any third party for this proposal.

# Next Steps

1. Gather feedback from the community.
2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage

## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust thirteen (13) total risk parameters across nine (9) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus.



## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters based on previously selected community risk level preferences. First, a continuation of the two previous liquidation bonus updates, [AIP-34: Liquidation Bonus Updates](https://app.aave.com/governance/30-QmccRszk94JUyj3xGcBUxUzCo43jZDQYgesEULsudVjm9v) and [AIP-38: Liquidation Bonus Updates for Eleven Aave V2 Assets](https://app.aave.com/governance/38-QmciauyTVnoHG6bAXCxHjHqTsUfiDz7rSGFxMADqFgCh4z). Second, updated LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters to realign with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the community. 

## Motivation

This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. While increased volatility affected most assets in the ecosystem, some tail assets experienced even higher volatility and larger collateral usage (supply that is significantly borrowed against). In addition, increased liquidity and decreased trading slippage for certain assets allow for lower liquidation bonuses.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

The ApeCoin DAO Founders Circle holds transformative potential that directly aligns with the objectives of DAO vote AIP-259. This initiative strategically reinforces the proposed impact within selected markets by establishing offices and operational hubs in those markets. The initiative contributes to significant realization in selected markets, elevating brand visibility, onboarding Web2 to Web3, and fostering long-term growth for ApeCoin.

**Selected Market Penetration**

The Founders Circle's approach of opening worldwide offices and operational hubs aligns perfectly with the intention to create significant impact in the selected markets identified by [AIP-259: Language and Market Focus for ApeCoin DAO in 2024-2025](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-259-language-and-market-focus-for-apecoin-dao-in-2024-2025/). This strategic alignment ensures that the ecosystem's presence is not only felt but also deeply integrated into these markets, effectively amplifying our reach and influence.


**Promoting ApeCoin DAO**

The initiative's inclusion of showcasing the ApeCoin DAO logo on buildings in the selected markets further elevates our brand visibility and reputation. By creating localized touchpoints, it introduces the organization's values, technologies, and services to a broader audience, positioning ApeCoin DAO as a leading entity within the metaverse.

**Onboarding Web2 to Web3**

The Founders Circle serves as a bridge for Web2 communities looking to enter the Web3 world. It provides a localized, supportive environment for tech companies and startups to learn about web3, NFTs, and blockchain technology, and our DAO facilitating a smooth transition into the crypto space.

**Long-Term Growth and Expansion**

The multi-year timeline of the Founders Circle’s operations further enhances the lasting impact outlined in AIP-259. By establishing a continuous presence, we can cultivate enduring relationships with local investors, startups, and communities, contributing to the sustained growth and influence sought by the DAO.

title: [ARFC] Gas Rebate for Recognized Delegates
author: @lbsblockchain, @MarcZeller Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
created: 2023-05-31
---

## Abstract

This ARFC introduces a mechanism for reimbursing gas fees to recognized delegates who vote on-chain on Aave.

## Motivation

As Ethereum gas fees continue to rise, the cost of on-chain governance for delegates has proportionally increased. This ARFC proposes a rebate system for these gas fees, aiming to incentivize active engagement and cultivate a more diverse voter base.

Rebating delegates for their participation offers several benefits:

- Encourages more active engagement from the delegate community by eliminating the disincentive to vote, leading to better decision-making for Aave.
- Fosters a more diverse voter base, including student organizations, by reducing the barrier to entry for voting. This creates a more open and collaborative delegate ecosystem, driving participation.
- Helps retain top delegates to foster the growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being an excellent Aave delegate should not result in a net cost to the delegate due to ever-increasing gas costs.
- Can be achieved at a relatively low cost. We also propose measures to reduce the administrative burden for Aave.

## Specification

### Claiming Process

Every quarter, an ARFC will be proposed (with the current one being the first) to publish an AIP reimbursing gas fees spent by recognized delegates.

These gas fees are determined by an open-source script written by @JosepBove, which allows anyone to generate a JSON file of recognized delegates' gas spending.

This script can be run and verified by any community member to approve the amounts distributed to recognized delegates.

Once a consensus has been reached on an ARFC, an appointed Governance Facilitator will submit an AIP to transfer aWETH to the delegate's address. We initially propose that the Aave Chan Initiative serves as the Governance Facilitator.

### Gas Rebate Token

We propose that the Gas Rebate Token be wETH.

## Problem

Uniswap's governance treasury will retain 43% of $UNI supply vested over 4 years, currently allocated 113 million in $UNI. Current value ~ ****$2.724 Billion USD. Max drawdown starting on May 3 2021, in 20 days $UNI lost 71% of it's value, a loss of ~ **$3.616 Billion USD.**
We need to manage this systemic risk and volatility for the long term success of the community treasury. 

## Solution

Partial divestment of Uniswap governance treasury by using UMA Synthetic KPI Options to create a win for the treasury, a win for the protocol and a win for the stakeholders. Long term goal would be to put together an actively managed portfolio for the treasury aka uniHOUSE.

# Background

## Yam.Finance

[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has been leading the charge on treasury management for DAOs via our project DAO House: [https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a](https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a)

We've realized that there are significant systemic risks for DAO's treasuries. During the bear market of 2017 multiple projects were forced to sell their treasury at historically low values, which ultimately caused many of them to disband and shutter. 

Treasury management is mission critical for DAOs, yet the challenges and complexities are formidable. Sushi realized this systemic issue and collaborated with [Yam.Finance](http://yam.Finance) to build a custom treasury management solution called sushiHOUSE: [https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106)

The most difficult part of a treasury management solution for a DAO as large as UNI, is the first part, the treasury protocol token divestment. I present a novel solution that will benefit the treasury, the long term success of the protocol and also all stakeholders. 

## UMA Synthetics

A quick primer on UMA: [https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works)

By using UMA's platform, we are able to use battle tested UMA financial contracts to create KPI options. Here are some examples of current KPI options that are already deployed and distributed.

[https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4)

[https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa](https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa)

# KPI Options

## How do KPI Options work?

KPI options can be created by using UMA's battle tested UMA financial contracts. 

1. Determine KPI metric for the synthetic. For example, KPI metric is Total Value Locked (TVL), currently ~$1.5b. KPI Metric could be many different things like volume, total fees generated over 30 days ect. 
2. Determine target for KPI, value and expiry date. For example, we want to target 2x TVL start, $3b and want the option to expire end of 2021.
3. Mint KPI option by depositing collateral to be used at settlement. For example, collateralize 1 $UNI token for 1 KPI option. 
4. For our example above:
    1. TVL option starts at a value of .5 $UNI because current TVL is $1.5b
    2. If TVL > $3b before the end of 2021, the TVL option can be settled for 1 $UNI after it expires at the end of 2021. 
    3. If TVL < $3b at expiry it will be worth a fraction of 1 $UNI. For example at expiry TVL is $2b, the value of the synth expires to 2/3 $UNI = .667 $UNI.
    4. Synth is unliquidatable and fully collateralized. 

## How do KPI Options divest UNI's community treasury?

From example above, KPI Option is created by:

1. Collateralizing 1 $UNI token 
2. KPI metric tracked is TVL, starting at $1.5b
3. Target is $3b TVL by the end of the year. If it reaches $3b TVL anytime before expiry  

UNI's community treasury is able to utilize its treasury full of UNI tokens to create these KPI options. 

1. KPI Options would be minted by treasury and sold for stable coins via a gnosis auction or by various other means. Implied value of the option is .5 UNI (current TVL is $1.5b with target of $3b). 
2. The sale would fund the treasury with stablecoins which could then be used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options by using Uniswap's AMM pools. 
3. At expiry all KPI options could be settled and stablecoins withdrawn from LP positions. 
4. Treasury now has stable coins = WIN!
5. UNI stake holders have incentives to increase TVL = WIN!
6. Stablecoins are the cornerstone of long term success for UNI protocol = WIN!

Win - Win - Win

# Additional Details

[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has extensive knowledge on building synthetics on UMA's platform via our development of [degenerative.finance](http://degenerative.finance), V2 of site to be launched soon. Combined with our experience in DAO treasury management, it allows us to have a unique perspective to create this proposal.

572,"Low-volume farms demotivate liquidity providers to stake. Low volume = high slippage and this is also bad for buyers.  If we rise low-volume farms' trading fees liquidity providers will stake more and reduce slippage which will benefit everyone in the end. 

1) If 7 days daily volume average is less than 15% of the staked pool give 0.10% bonus trading fees to the liquidity providers
2) if less then 10% then give additional 0.10% bonuse 
3) if less then 5% then give 0.13% additional bonuse

For example, if the daily volume is less than 5% of a staked amount of a farm then it will have 0.17%(default fee)+0.11%+0.11%+0.12% which is a 0.51% trading fee for the liquidity providers instead of 0.17%. So 3 times more fee.

575,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

**Based on the last vote outcome, this proposal has been resubmitted after much consideration and data analysis to come up with the final list of farms to adjust farm rewards for. Please read the proposal carefully and consider the implications before casting your vote.**

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

title: [ARFC] CRV Interest Rate Curve Upgrade
Author: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @dydymoon @scottincrypto
Dated: 2023-01-11

---

# Simple Summary

@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to update the CRV interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (when deployed), Polygon v3, and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools.

# Abstract

The CRV Supply Cap on the Polygon v3 deployment is currently at 100% with borrowing costs of 7.18% with a Utilization of 44.48% relative to a 45% Uoptimal value, [1]. This proposal intends to increase the CRV Supply Cap on Polygon v3 deployment, improve the capital efficiency of each liquidity pool, and increase the amount of revenue generated across the various CRV reserves.

Capital efficiency is improved by increasing the Uoptimal value. Revenue is increased by introducing a Base interest rate, doubling the interest rate at the Uoptimal point, and aligning the Reserve Factor to 20% across all pools. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and significantly reduce the amount of free CRV in aggregate across the Reserves.

# Motivation

With the CRV Reserve on Polygon reaching its Supply Cap, this is an ideal time to implement an upgrade that addresses the Supply Cap and Interest Rate parameters. The current CRV Interest Rate reflects the original parameters implemented when the liquidity pools were deployed. The Interest Rate Parameters do not take into consideration the alternative use cases for CRV and consequently, Aave has missed out on revenue from the sustained borrowing demand.

Llama expects the sustained borrowing demand to continue due to the veTokenomics construct presenting several opportunities for CRV borrowers to earn yield. In this proposal, the Uoptimal parameter is to be increased from 45% to 80% improving the capital efficiency of the active reserves.

Specific to the Polygon v3 deployment, increasing the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will lead to an increase in the Borrow Cap, which is a function of the Supply Cap and Uoptimal parameter.

Borrow Cap = Supply Cap * (Uoptimal + 0.1)

The new Supply Cap parameter has been prepared by Chaos Labs, 1,125.24. This generates a new Borrow Cap of 1,012.72, [2].

With borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it will become rational for profit-driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield. This has been playing out with demand on Polygon v3 increasing relative to other deployments.

The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 44,48% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14%, which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time.

In addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at >0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a CRV interest rate equivalent to the BAL interest rate curve (which has a base 3%, slope 1 = 14%, and slope 2 = 150%).

The graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.

The Reserve Factor on Polygon v3 is to be increased from 10% to 20%, bringing it in line with all other Aave deployments.

580,"## Simple summary

Proposal for the Aave DAO to have a [Cantina security competition](https://cantina.xyz/competitions)  for the upcoming Aave v3.1 upgrade, to complement the other security procedures already completed.
The budget will be a total of $195’000, with $150’000 prize pool and the rest ($45'000) allocated to platform and judging fees.

 

## Motivation

With the [Aave v3.1 upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-1-and-aave-origin/17305) well received by the community, and now entering into its final stages of pre-activation governance procedures, from the BGD side we have been thinking on how to add even more security assurances, in addition to what was already done and described [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-1-and-aave-origin/17305#security-16).

Open security competitions/contests are getting important adoption as a good pre-production mechanism: a scope is defined for some public code, and any security researcher can look into it for a limited period of time, in order to the prizes from a common prize pool. The more bugs found (and more unique, amongst other characteristics of the finding), the better the rewards.

We think that a competition can have extra security value for the improvements included into Aave v3.1, and after evaluating different solutions in the market, we have decided that doing an open Cantina competition fits into our requirements.

 

## Specification

After discussions with their team regarding options, we propose to create a [Cantina competition](https://cantina.xyz/competitions) with the following characteristics:

- $150’000 total prize pot, with the following limitations:
    - If there is any High (highest grade) finding, the whole $150’000 prize pot will be distributed.
    - If there is only Medium or lower grade findings, $50’000 prize pot will be distributed.
    - If there is only Lower/Informational, $20’000 prize pot will be distributed.
    
    The total of funds will be transferred initially to Cantina, and if applicable reimburse afterwards to the Aave DAO contracts.
    
- 20% fees over the total prize pot, amounting $30’000. Additional $15’000 for Cantina judging.
- The competition will last for 10 calendar days.
- Start of the competition will depend on governance procedures timing, but if all are approved, the target will be beginning of the week of May 6th.
- Before the start, BGD Labs will collaborate with Cantina to have the best possible setup for researchers to tackle the competition, including but not limited to all required extra documentation. During the competition, we will also give all necessary support.
- The execution of the on-chain AIP proposal will act as a binding agreement between the Aave DAO and Cantina.
- Only current or previous team members of BGD Labs and Certora, MixBytes (auditors of v3.1) during the last 6 months are non-eligible for any prizes in the competition, given the conflict of interest. Any other entity or individual is allowed to participate.

 

## Next steps

- In parallel to this Snapshot, we will start preparations for a positive outcome, including the AIP that will mark the final approval, releasing the funds.",neutral
581,"Introduction

BounceBit is excited to propose the integration of Venus’s lending and borrowing services into the BounceBit chain. This collaboration aims to enhance the functionality and reach of both platforms by supporting BounceBit’s native assets, BBTC and BBUSD, which are Liquidity-Secured Derivatives (LSD) from Ceffu. The integration will enable effective funding rate arbitrage and yield generation for these assets, aligning with the strategic goals of both entities to foster innovation and growth in the DeFi ecosystem.

Background

BounceBit’s unique CeDeFi infrastructure blends centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) to provide parallel yield generation. Users can earn original CeFi yield while utilizing LSD for BTC staking and on-chain farming, known as restaking in Bitcoin. This ecosystem offers three types of yield for Bitcoin holders: original CeFi yield, node operation rewards from staking BTC on the BounceBit chain, and opportunity yield from participating in on-chain applications and the Bounce Launchpad.

BBTC and BBUSD have been developed as part of a strategic initiative to leverage the stability and security of LSD mechanisms provided by Ceffu. The primary goal is to facilitate seamless and profitable interactions in arbitrage and lending/borrowing scenarios on the BounceBit chain.

Value to the Community

Integrating Venus’s lending and borrowing services with BounceBit will bring significant value to the community through several use cases:

Enhanced Utility and Liquidity: BBTC and BBUSD holders can leverage their assets for yield farming, staking, and arbitrage within a secure and efficient framework.

Premium Yield Generation: Users can participate in premium yield generation strategies such as funding rate arbitrage through Ceffu’s MirrorX solution, enabling access to deep liquidity on multiple asset markets with reduced counterparty risk.

Comprehensive Asset Management: Users gain access to diversified asset management services, allowing them to choose strategies that best fit their risk tolerance and investment goals.

Security and Compliance: The integration will adhere to high standards of security and regulatory compliance, ensuring user trust and system integrity.

Additional Information

● Stablecoin Support: BBUSD is backed 1:1 by USDT and FDUSD in Ceffu, enhancing its stability and reliability. Stablecoins from various EVM-compatible Chains, such as FDUSD on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) and USDT on Ethereum, can be bridged into the BounceBit ecosystem. Once transferred, these tokens are uniformly mapped and represented as BBUSD within BounceBit.
● KYC Requirements: KYC is only required for very large customers to participate in CeDeFi activities, maintaining ease of access while ensuring compliance.
Proposal

We propose that Venus deploy its lending and borrowing protocols on the BounceBit chain to support BBTC and BBUSD. This deployment will allow BounceBit users to leverage their assets for additional financial operations, such as yield farming and arbitrage, within the safe and efficient framework provided by Venus.

Technical Considerations

● Asset Compatibility: BounceBit will ensure that BBTC and BBUSD are fully compatible with Venus protocols by aligning with the technical requirements of Venus. This includes adapting the asset management to integrate smoothly with Venus’s operations on both testnet and mainnet.
● Security and Compliance: User contributions to Total Value Locked (TVL) are securely managed by Mainnet Digital’s regulated custodial services, assuring both compliance and safety. These assets are then mirrored via Ceffu’s MirrorX service, a key integration by BounceBit that maintains on-chain visibility and transparency of these assets. All integrations will adhere to the highest standards of security and regulatory compliance, with regular audits and reviews to maintain system integrity and user trust.
Implementation Phases

Initial Testing on Testnet: Deploy Venus protocols on the BounceBit testnet for initial integration testing and to gather user feedback.

Deployment on Mainnet: Following successful testnet trials and necessary adjustments, deploy the protocols on the BounceBit mainnet.

Expected Outcomes

● Enhanced utility and liquidity for BBTC and BBUSD on the BounceBit platform.
● Expanded opportunities for users to engage in lending, borrowing, and arbitrage.
● Strengthened collaboration between BounceBit and Venus, setting a precedent for futurecooperative efforts within the DeFi ecosystem.
Conclusion

BounceBit’s infrastructure is meticulously architected to elevate Bitcoin’s status from a passive asset to an active, yield-generating instrument. By offering an integrated platform where Bitcoin holders can capitalize on the strengths of both CeFi and DeFi, BounceBit is pioneering a new chapter in asset optimization and financial innovation within the blockchain space.We believe this proposal aligns with the strategic goals of both Venus and BounceBit, offering substantial benefits to our users and the broader DeFi community. We look forward to your feedback and hope for a positive response to proceed with this exciting initiative.

# Proposal summary
## Uniswap V3 launch on Polygon zkEVM.

### Overview of proposal
We propose to authorize Uniswap Labs to deploy Uniswap’s protocol to the Polygon Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup known as “zkEVM” on behalf of the community.

We believe this is the right moment for Uniswap v3 to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons:

* Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility.
* An Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.
* A new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization, to address the required recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts.
* Polygon is aligned with Ethereum and its values.

### About Polygon Labs

Polygon Labs is the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. It is rapidly building a suite of protocols that will offer developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions:

- L2 solutions/Rollups (Polygon Hermez 2, Polygon Miden 2);
- Sidechains, stand-alone and enterprise chains (Polygon SDK 1);
- Hybrid solutions (Polygon PoS);
- Data availability solutions (Polygon Avail 2) and more.

The Polygon network is by far the most adopted scaling effort in the Ethereum ecosystem, with 3,000+ applications hosted, 1B+ transactions processed, 100M+ unique user addresses and ~$5B+ in assets secured.

### Motivation
There’s significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkEVM helps solidify Uniswap’s place as the number one DEX and a thought leader.

Importantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Additionally, given the community and user uptake Uniswap has seen on Polygon PoS, it’s only natural to make its deployment on Polygon zkEVM a priority.

## Partner Details
### Polygon Labs

This proposal is being made by Jack Melnick, DeFi BD Lead, an employee of Polygon Labs. Polygon Labs is a legal entity focused on the ecosystem growth and maintenance of the suite of Polygon Networks.

### Partner Legal

The legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as “Polygon Labs”.

### Delegate Sponsor

There is no delegate co-authoring or sponsoring this proposal. Instead, this is a proposal submitted by Jack Melnick of Polygon Labs to support the growth of Polygon as part of the overall Polygon community.

### Conflict of Interest Declaration

There are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Uniswap’s legal entities, including Uniswap Labs, UNI tokens, nor investments of Uniswap Labs Ventures.

## KPI & Success Criteria

### Target KPIs
There are generally 2 forms of projects:

1) Growth-driven projects: on-chain, trackable metrics preferred here.

2) Strategic Initiatives: that targets a specific goal (e.g. Uniswap Foundation core initiatives). These are more completion based.

![cb3bb480aa0a9ae1b520f73a0e0c16654f8f9e33.png](ipfs://bafkreidivzmticu723vvql57p6suqwurkd3lekjmfsbspy3h72pjn4ul6u)
 
### What does success look like?

Success Criteria: A successful zkEVM deployment will, in an organic and sustained manner, grow Uniswap’s Total Addressable Market across TVL, unique interacting wallet, volumes, and integration with partner dApps. As demand for zk-blockchains and proximity to Ethereum rises, users and builders will increasingly look to zkEVM solutions to build and trade.

### What potential risks are there for this project’s success? How could they be mitigated?

Risk Profile: Deploying on zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer Two, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereum’s core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. 

The bridge has been disintermediated, and Uniswap can expect reputable Oracle providers to be available as data providers from Day One. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months, and has accumulated over 84,000 wallets, 75,000 ZK proofs, and 300,000 blocks. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens. 

Primary risks, as always, include still unforeseen vectors, which can be mitigated through close work with Polygon developer support (whenever needed) and gradual deployment of liquidity on the new chain.

### Protocol security
Please address the following questions if you’re proposing a cross-chain deployment:

**Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?** Yes

**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?** No trusted entity, multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes, only L1 and L2 security. Pure smart contract interactions only.

**Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity?** All based on L1 and L2. L2 security is based on the L1.

**Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?** There are two ways to use the bridge:
- Native supported messages: Allow only bridging of ERC-20 and ETH. Here there is nothing someone can do other than that.
- Custom Messages: Custom receiver logic on the other side of the bridge. When you send a message the message needs to be received by a smart contract, so you have to build the receiver smart contract, which is specific to the logic of that smart contract. Here the security is up to the person building the receiver smart contract. These custom messages do not take custody of any funds. All we guarantee is that the message will pass the bridge if implemented correctly. We are just the message carrier.

**What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?** Here we assume no possibility for fraud.

**Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?** There is an ongoing audit process by a third party. We will not go to Mainnet without the results from the audit and vulnerabilities remedied.",neutral

- Ape coin staking has been one of the most anticipated events in the crypto space. Ensuring the security and efficiency is a high priority.
- Multiple gas optimizations were proposed to the community and Horizen Labs team and received positive feedback, the team have implemented them and they are live on the mainnet staking contract.
- For the input on optimizing the gas fees consumption that were disclosed and discussed previously on an AIP idea, a reward is proposed for the timely contribution.
- Note that gas optimizations are completely out of AIP-134 bug bounty scope, as it is only focused on security vulnerabilities.

#### OVERALL COST

Proposed reward is a floor BAYC, equivalent to 10% of the funds saved upfront. It would be HODLed and staked to earn $APE rewards.

591,"In 2019, the first version of the Aave protocol smart contracts (the “Aave Protocol”) were deployed to the Ethereum mainnet. V1 of the Aave Protocol provided a way for users to provide and obtain liquidity autonomously, and to earn yield on any liquidity provided to the protocol.   

In December 2020, a second version of the Aave Protocol was deployed, which brought new features to liquidity provision and liquidity access in the DeFi ecosystem. V2 of the Aave Protocol featured, among other things, credit delegation, the ability for users to choose between stable and variable interest rates on any borrow transaction and certain gas optimizations and improvements.   

Around the same time, Aave Governance gained administration and maintenance over V1 and V2 of the Aave Protocol, and were tasked with the continued growth of the ecosystem around the Aave Protocol (the “Aave Ecosystem”). 

The Aave Ecosystem has grown organically over the past two years, supporting successful, safe and risk conscious operation of the Aave Protocol.  The community has supported the Aave Protocol’s expansion from the Ethereum mainnet to the Polygon and Avalanche networks as well. 

After these two years of substantial growth, this snapshot proposal to the Aave Governance seeks community approval for a new iteration of the Aave Protocol: Introducing Aave V3. 👻 🎉 

The features associated with Aave V3 represent a significant technological advancement from DeFi liquidity protocols as we know them today. 

Aave V3 introduces the following features (among others):  

- Portal: allows assets to seamlessly flow between Aave V3 markets over different networks; 

- High Efficiency Mode: allows borrowers to extract the highest borrowing power out of their collateral;  

- Isolation Mode: limits exposure and risks to the protocol from newly listed assets by only permitting borrowing up to a specific debt ceiling;  

- Risk Management Improvements: provides additional protection for the protocol through various risk caps and other tools;  

-  L2-Specific Features: designs specific to Layer 2 networks to improve user experience and reliability;  

-  Community Contribution: facilitates and incentivizes community usage through a modular, well organized codebase. 

These features make V3 the most robust and efficient DeFi liquidity protocol ever designed. 

In the event that the community votes affirmatively, the Aave Protocol V3 codebase audits being conducted by OpenZeppelin, Trail Of Bits, Peckshield, ABDK and Certora will be completed in or around the end of November. In addition, certain auditors may apply to the DAO to conduct additional audits of the code upon release before deployment. 

If the community votes positively for deployment of V3 of the Aave Protocol, there will be a set of additional Snapshot votes for the community to determine the following: 

- Deployment Networks:  Given the proliferation of efficient networks, including L2s, the community can vote on which networks V3 will be released initially.  V3 will be able to be deployed on a maximum of three networks upon release, so the Snapshot will be a “ranking” vote. 

- The V3 code licensing: In light of the fact that the Aave Ecosystem is highly diffuse and decentralized, Aave Governance will decide what type of license, if any, will apply to the Aave Protocol V3 code.  As far as we are aware, this is a first for the DeFi space! 

- The V3 Bug Bounty program: The community will decide on size, duration and scope of the Bug Bounty program, as well as who (e.g., the RiskDAO, etc. – see proposal here [insert RiskDAO governane proposal]) will administer the program. 

- Retroactive funding:  The community will also be able to decide whether to provide retroactive funding to those who contributed to the creation of V3, and how much funding to provide.   

If the community votes to deploy V3, another ARC will provide additional details relating to each of the additional votes described above. 

Once these votes determine the community decisions and the current audits are finalized, the deployments voted upon by the community can begin.

596,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V3 Avalanche assets.

## Motivation

Chaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. 

Please find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).

You can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Avalanche/recommendations).

The output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to optimize parameters for WAVAX, sAVAX and LINK.e on V3 Avalanche, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a negligible effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)

**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$26K, with a negligible increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**

### Liquidity Analysis:

Based on our analysis, we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support any significant liquidations with the updated parameters.

### Positions Analysis

We have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations.

### Recommendations

| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WAVAX | Liquidation Bonus | 10% | 9% | -1% |
| sAVAX | Liquidation Threshold | 30% | 40% | +10% |
| sAVAX | Loan-to-Value | 20% | 30% | +10% |

597,"**Protocol Description:**

>USDD (Decentralized USD) is the first over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin with a guaranteed minimum collateral ratio of 130%. It has been launched collaboratively by the TRON DAO Reserve and top-tier mainstream blockchain institutions. The USDD protocol runs on the TRON network, is connected to Ethereum and BNB Chain through the BTTC cross-chain protocol, and will be accessible across more blockchains in the future.

The real-time collateral ratio is now over 300% — a total of $2.3 billion of assets backing the 725 million USDD in circulation.

PSM (Peg Stability Module) is a stablecoin swap tool launched by the TRON DAO Reserve. Users can swap between USDD and USDT at a 1:1 ratio.PSM offers a more stable and competitive price with no slippage and zero fees.

PSM helps keep the USDD peg close to $1 U.S. dollar during times when USDD demand outstrips USDD supply. With the newly introduced PSM, the process of USDD SWAP is actually the process of USDD issuing via the fixed ratio collateralizing. All PSM users actually participate in the issuance of USDD.

ADSHARES is asking the APECOIN DAO to provide funding to create an **APE AD MARKETPLACE**, which will enable Otherdeed owners and creators to monetize their creations and lands with ads – and take in ad revenue in ApeCoin.

While we see this ecosystem as open to external advertisers – it’s primarily designed as an **internal ad network** - one that would enable the DAO, the Creators (Yuga, Animoca, Improbable), the Otherdeed owners, and Experience creators or Celebrities to promote their work across all Metaverses.

We have already proven successful in creating such infrastructure for Decentraland. 90K+ lands have direct access to an advertising network, and over 100 parcel owners have joined, creating the largest ad network there. And everyone - from the DCL DAO, through Land owners and experience designers, to regular brands can place their ads automatically, in a couple of clicks, using the [web3ads.net](http://web3ads.net/) ad server. A whole APECOIN AD marketplace could be created - where advertisers buy placements directly from creators. Now, we want to take this to the Otherside.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

* It opens **a new, sustainable revenue stream for the ApeCoin community** → Monetizing user traffic with ads
* It can **integrate ALL of the ApeCoin elements: The Otherside, the Website, Game sites** (DookieDash, Legends of the Mara) and many others
* It **increases demand for APE** → All ad revenue is paid in APE.
* Payments for ads are done on chain, in crypto.
* **Any APE holder can place their ad on the ad server** - promote their project inside the ApeCoin Ecosystem
* It brings **new utility for NFT lands** → Otherdeed owners can earn APE by placing ads on their property. They can also advertise their products and services.
* Advertising allows us to **build deeper relationships with world-leading brands, thus accelerating the Metaverse adoption**.
* ApeCoin DAO has **complete ownership over all crucial aspects of the ad system**.

#### OVERALL COST

AdServer setup and customization|$25K|
| --- | --- |
|AdScoring system|$10K|
|Management|$15K|
|OpenRTB connector|$5K|
|ApeCoin integration|$5K|

**Preamble:** the below break down represents the actual COST on our side: man-hours, resources etc.
However - in order to prove our motivations and our vision - we want to offer the APECOIN DAO a 30% discount.
The total cost of implementation listed below would be **USD $40K**.

## Summary

Introduce govFactor, an on-chain voting factor of 1.1 for Balancer Liquidity Providers.

If passed, the govFactor will initially be implemented as a 3 month trial with voter participation acting as the key success metric. 

## Background

🔥_ 🔥 ([FireEyesDAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao)) has been actively working with the Balancer team over the past few months in an effort to develop a robust suite of governance mechanisms to complement the upcoming launch of Balancer V2.

One of the issues we concluded on: consistent voter participation has historically been an issue for many DeFi protocols. Whether it results in proposals not reaching quorum or only having a small number of participants involved, it’s become obvious that protocols need to drive meaningful voter participation across a diverse group of users.

The govFactor creates a simple incentive mechanism for liquidity providers (LPs) to actively participate in governance. 

## Motivation

As it stands, Balancer liquidity mining encourages passive participation. Liquidity Providers (LPs) simply deposit capital into the protocol and earn BAL. Despite the significant subsidy LPs receive in the form of governance tokens, there’s no expectation or requirement that they actively participate in governance.

This ultimately represents a misalignment as LPs have no incentive to vote despite constantly accruing voting weight. If the suppliers are subsidized by the protocol with governance power, they should be willing stewards of the protocol as well.

This does not mean that LPs MUST participate, but instead **they should have an incentive to participate**. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to incentivize those that service the protocol to help govern it as well, aligning their participation with additional weighting to their weekly liquidity mining rewards. 

## Specification

The govFactor is an on-chain voting incentive for LPs that affects BAL liquidity mining allocations depending on whether or not an address voted on the last governance proposal. The implementation multiplies BAL amounts each LP gets by their govFactor (1.1 for those who voted, 1.0 for those who did not) and then normalizes all amounts so that the sum is still 145,000 BAL per week. 

The govFactor will operate as an “on/off” switch where LPs that voted on the most recent proposal by signing a transaction turn “on” the factor.

Providers that did not vote on the last proposal by signing a transaction have their govFactor “off”, forfeiting the factor and in turn, receive lower LP rewards than those that voted on the last proposal. This dynamic will remain “off” until the next on-chain proposal is open for voting and ratified on-chain.

If all LPs vote, then the rewards remain the same as if no one votes.

 **To make calculations as simple as possible, govFactor would be applied after all other factors.**

GovFactor looks at addresses who have voted on the most recent proposal featured on Snapshot and references to see if the address is also providing liquidity to the protocol. If both variables are met, the protocol includes a factor to their weekly BAL liquidity mining allocation.

It’s important to note that this reference happens entirely on-chain, meaning there’s no need to cross-link any addresses to a forum or public username.

Ultimately, the **govFactor creates a unified incentive for those that service the protocol to become active governance participants as well** and should be considered by the community as a simple mechanism for encouraging governance participation from the protocol's supply-side actors.  

## Drawbacks

Some points to consider surrounding the GovFactor:

* The end result could be a lot of non-engaged voting, coming from LPs who don't hold meaningful amounts of BAL (even if being large LPs) and who don't really care about Balancer governance, putting little to no effort in the decision process behind their votes.
* The GovFactor encourages LPs to vote through their liquidity mining address, which could pose some issues for opsec conscious users. However, Snapshot now enables delegation from cold wallets which would mitigate this issue. 
* The cadence between different governance proposals is likely to differ. This means that someone who votes on the last proposal preceding a large time gap to the next proposal may see increased liquidity rewards despite not actively participating in governance discussions.
* The state of Balancer Governance is relatively idle and therefore implementing a governance incentive isn’t currently necessary for the success of the protocol.",bullish

This is a proposal to raise the liquidity mining cap from $100M to uncapped for $AAVE

# The Proposal

After the activation of the Balancer Based Safety Module 20 Days ago, the liquidity for $AAVE quickly grew to be the Largest Balancer protocol Liquidity Pool as new LPs join the AAVE/BAL incentivized Safety Module.

![image|690x101](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/464af158056f0a77cbf50195bfc2bb8a987826c1.png) 

Current APY by staking in the Safety Module is 29.34%, only considering the AAVE rewards, The Pool is still growing and Balancer is now the best protocol to swap AAVE onchain.

As BAL is a collateral option in Aave, aBPT stakers can use their BAL rewards to unlock more borrowing power in the Aave Protocol.

Uncapping the BAL rewards for the AAVE/ETH pool will allows even further incentive to bring more liquidity onchain and increase the synergies between the Aave & Balancer protocols.

# What is The Safety Module?

The Aave Safety Module acts as a collateral for the whole Aave ecosystem. AAVE holders, and now - with the new Balancer Based Stake - AAVE/ETH holders benefit from long term rewards for securing the protocol from insolvency, while at the same time bearing the risk of being slashed in case of shortfall events.
Having a very liquid onchain market and a consistent capital allocated in the Safety Module greatly increases the safety of the Aave ecosystem and the Aave protocol liquidity providers.",bullish

1. We will work with the DAO and legal to give back 2% of equity to the DAO. This first of it’s kind give back will usher in the next wave of AIP’s and set the stage for true value creation within the DAO amplified by the marketing impact through branding, education and culture driven social content and sharing. By taking this on, Bored Brewing will lay the difficult, but exciting groundwork for giving back to the DAO.

2. We will be spreading knowledge about $APE coin to less crypto native people who enjoy drinking beer. We believe that $APE can become a currency for the digital revolution and we want to be a small part of spreading the name to a demographic thirsty for this type of knowledge outside of the crypto community.

3. We will sponsor partnered events and share the $APE coin brand across other relevant crypto/nft communities. The goal is to market the coin and share the background and goals of the DAO for the future.

#### OVERALL COST

149,696 $APE Tokens

614,"# Summary

As described on [this post](https://governance.aave.com/t/sigma-prime-security-assessment-services-for-aave/8518), Sigma Prime has prepared a proposal to provide continuous security assessment services to the Aave ecosystem, provisioning up to 280 person-days of effort (240 + 40 optional) allocated throughout 7 testing windows, and spread over a period of 12 months.

[Sigma Prime](https://sigp.io)  has been providing security assessment services to Aave for the past 2.5 years, reviewing critical components such as Aave v2 and Aave v3, along with various other changes made to the lending platform.

This preliminary Snapshot vote serves to obtain approval from the community on the outlined proposal.

615,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-empower-ballers-to-allocate-bal-to-polygon/1964).

Polygon (MATIC) has seen strong user adoption this year with major DeFi projects like Aave, Sushi, and Curve all deploying there. The time has come for Balancer to join the party. The polygon team has agreed to pledge $5M worth of MATIC as rewards over the course of 8 weeks to be allocated at our discretion. Balancer Labs has taken care of deployment logistics and with the approval of BAL voters we can jump start liquidity with BAL + MATIC incentives. This proposal would allow the Ballers to allocate BAL + MATIC incentives to chosen Balancer pools on polygon. To match polygon’s $5M worth of MATIC, I propose we begin with a 25,000 BAL per week allocation which can be adjusted in the future at the discretion of the Ballers but not reduced below 25,000 until the initial 8 week matching period has completed. These 25,000 BAL would come from the fixed 145,000 weekly issuance, reducing the total L1 incentive to 120,000 rather than increasing BAL inflation.

**Motivation**

Other polygon deployments have been wildly successful. Recently Sushi has done more volume on polygon than ETH mainnet (check [this thread](https://twitter.com/RaphaelSignal/status/1406234551618244611) and [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mhonkasalo/status/1406181121562398723)). Balancer brings a unique primitive to polygon by being the only flexible AMM. Forthcoming features like the stable swap factory will give us additional competitive advantages on polygon compared to ETH mainnet where similar products exist in the market. Based on my analysis of Sushi’s metrics, I believe we can also expect to exceed fees earned on ETH mainnet after a few weeks go by on polygon.

The Ballers plan to focus on multi-asset pools with higher fees and potentially building partnerships with polygon native projects. Any community input about pool composition or projects worth connecting with is greatly appreciated (#governance in discord).

25,000 is a sizable commitment but the potential opportunity is significant. I strongly believe we can generate more fees per BAL spent on polygon than we can with our current strategy on ETH mainnet.

**Specification**

If approved, the Ballers will immediately begin designing pools and assigning the BAL + MATIC rewards. As mentioned, the MATIC rewards would last for 8 weeks ($5M total over 8 weeks) and a minimum of 25,000 BAL per week would last for 8 weeks. After that, the Ballers can decide to adjust that number up or down (with community input!).

The goal is to vote this weekend and begin incentives on the 28th - pending any community discussion of course.",bearish
616,"[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum.](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-reinstate-lend-to-the-liquidity-mining-whitelist/471)

This proposal does not necessarily reflect my ([@rabmarut](https://forum.balancer.finance/u/rabmarut)) personal view. I am relaying the request from the community.

**TL;DR**

Add the recently removed $LEND token back into the liquidity mining whitelist. Because $LEND was already whitelisted, it would be reinstated at its existing cap tier (`cap3`=$10M).

**Context**

The Aave protocol recently introduced a new token called $AAVE to replace their existing token, $LEND. The new token will have a fair amount of functionality within the Aave protocol moving forward, whereas the old token is intended to be deprecated over time as token holders migrate. A 1:1 bridge exists for migrating $LEND to $AAVE, after which the $LEND is forever removed from circulation. At time of writing, there is no fixed timeline for the token migration, but the Aave community may introduce a deadline in the near future.

**Proposal**

This past week, a whitelist request for the new $AAVE token was honored. The typical procedure for token migrations is to directly edit the existing whitelist entry for a token with its new contract address; this is designed to incentivize Balancer LPs to migrate to newer contracts to the benefit of the wider ecosystem. As a consequence, in this particular case, the (very popular) $LEND token is no longer whitelisted on Balancer, having been replaced by the $AAVE token. The spirit of this decision is that $LEND liquidity will become less useful over time while $AAVE liquidity will likely undergo a period of rapid ramp-up.

Some users have expressed frustration at this decision, initially citing tax implications. Other users may have other considerations, including but not limited to the gas costs of a liquidity migration. This proposal provides an opportunity for those users to vote to reinstate the $LEND token to the whitelist such that both $LEND and $AAVE would coexist on Balancer and draw BAL rewards from the liquidity mining program. New tokens typically enter the whitelist at `cap1`, but $LEND is not a new token - having already been whitelisted at `cap3` - so its former cap tier would also be reinstated.

Though undoubtedly some community members would hope that this change may apply retroactively, it doesn't seem fair to any users who already migrated thinking that it would be necessary. This hardly seems the time to set a precedent for retroaction, so hopefully LPs would be satisfied enough with these changes taking effect at 00:00 UTC on Monday, October 12. A week's worth of BAL rewards would be lost to $LEND holders, as the previous whitelist proposal made clear that the token would be removed this week.",neutral

620,"Title: [ARFC] Modify Snapshot Proposal Threshold

Author: @fig [Flipside Crypto]

Created: 2023-04-07

___

## Summary:

This proposal presents updating Aave's Snapshot space’s proposal threshold to 250 AAVE.

## Abstract:

Aave has experienced instances of scammers and bad actors attempting to submit phishing proposals. These proposals have caused disruptions in Aave’s off-chain governance and have resulted in a waste of time and resources.

To prevent these incidents from happening again, we propose modifying the Snapshot proposal threshold to 250 AAVE. 

## Motivation:

We recommend that the community update the proposal threshold to a level that would deter scammers and bad actors. The new threshold would require proposals to meet certain minimum requirements, in this case holding or delegated 250 AAVE (or equivalent.)

This level is 3.3X the previous proposal threshold as of 04/07/23. By updating this threshold, we can ensure that only legitimate proposals are considered and that the risk of scams, illegitimate, or fraudulent proposals is significantly reduced.

Here is an example of recurring junk proposals:
 
![Screen Shot 2023-05-01 at 4.12.43 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreibwvoifwhv6uqyeatkzt44rndspw75jm5lx2afcl23qghwgy37ajy)
    

By modifying the proposal threshold required to post a Snapshot, there are many benefits for Aave’s off-chain Governance process.

A few notable ones include:

1. *Better quality proposals:* By setting a higher threshold, we will receive proposals from more experienced and qualified professionals and delegates
2. *Reduced risk of fraud:* Increasing the proposal threshold will help to reduce the risk of scams and fraudulent proposals.
3. *Improved efficiency:* By setting a higher threshold, we will have fewer proposals to review, which will help us to be more efficient with our time and resources.

## Specification:

To implement this proposal, an Aave Snapshot admin will need to update the space’s proposal threshold to 250 AAVE and communicate these new requirements.

A list of existing admins with this ability:

* @monet-supply 
* @marczeller
* 0xc8E0345596D7196941E61D3aB607E57Fe61F85E7
* 0x2357df661D0E56140dF30c3ad0b2B426fB4666e6
* 0x60C8dC4762b217b4A00FF1824111077f331B1FbF
* 0x2D0D6A8553993a3E9eD1D86415358D1EDEfa82F1


## Next Steps

Next steps to ensure a successful upgrade of Snapshot’s proposal threshold:

1. Gather feedback and input from the Aave community on the proposed threshold
2. Incorporate and refine the proposal based on feedback from the community
3. Upgrade and communicate the new requirements to potential proposers


## Conclusion:

Increasing the proposal threshold is a simple but effective way to prevent scammers and bad actors from submitting proposals.

By doing so, we can ensure that we receive better quality proposals, reduce the risk of fraud, and be more efficient with our time and resources.

Flipside will work with community stakeholders like @MatthewGraham (TokenLogic) @MarcZeller (ACI) @bgdlabs to create related proposals which revamp and updates the Snapshot space and permissions.

This is the first of a series to come.

622,"[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-increase-mkr-captier-from-cap3-to-cap4-10m-30m/233).

**TL:DR**

As outlined in the [new whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the MKR capFactor from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). MKR has exceeded $10m adjusted liquidity for a period of time. MKR bring good liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem.

---

**The Proposal**

This is a proposal to increase the MKR cap Tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). MKR currently has $16M in adjusted liquidity and has probably surpassed it's $10M cap for a month.

MKR brings useful liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem. Before, Uniswap used to be the most popular DEX for trading MKR.

---

**What is MKR?**

MKR is a DeFi large cap, it currently has a $600M market cap. There's currently $1.5B locked in MakerDAO, and 425M DAI has been minted.

SCD (Single Collateral DAI) was launched in December 2017. MCD (Multi Collateral DAI) was launched in November 2019.

MakerDAO is a decentralized credit platform on Ethereum that supports DAI, a stablecoin whose value is pegged to USD. Anyone can use Maker to open a Vault, lock in collateral such as ETH, BAT, or WBTC ... and generate Dai as debt against that collateral. Dai debt incurs a stability fee (i.e., continuously accruing interest), which is paid upon repayment of borrowed Dai. DAI is collected as system surplus, and then used in FLAP auctions to burn MKR.

MKR can also be used as a governance token to govern the system. MKR holders also act as the last line of defense in case of a black swan event. If system-wide collateral value falls too low too fast, MKR is minted and sold on the open market to raise more collateral, diluting MKR holders.

# What is APENFT?
From the team:
“Its aim is to establish itself as the ARK Star Fund in the NFT world, building a bridge between renowned artists and the blockchain while nurturing the growth of native crypto artists in the NFT space.
APENFT's objective is to transform art pieces, which once was an elite-exclusive item, to something that belongs to everyone. APENFT is backed by the underlying technology of top-notch blockchains Ethereum and TRON with support from the world's largest distributed storage system Bittorrent File System (BTFS). APENFT and its token NFT run on the Ethereum and TRON public chain under the ERC721/TRC721 standard and are permanently stored in the decentralized storage system BTFS.”

634,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BSC etc.

Gauntlet has been engaged by the Arbitrum Foundation to support the migration from bridged USDC.e to native USDC on the network. As part of this project, Gauntlet seeks to distribute ARB rewards across Aave v3 on Arbitrum to encourage migration from USDC.e to USDC.

There is currently 15.59M units of USDC.e deposited on Arbitrum v3 that Gauntlet & the Arbitrum Foundation intend to attract to USDC with the use of ARB rewards.

# Specification

The `EmissionManager`, a governance controlled function, assigns the `Emission_Admin` role for a specified token, ARB on the Arbitrum network. 

The `Emission_Admin` role controls the distribution of the specified token, ARB, across the specified Aave v3 deployment.

The `Emission_Admin` can distribute ARB anywhere across the Aave v3 Arbitrum Liquidity Pool.

# Implementation

Set `Emission_Admin` permission for ARB to the following Gauntlet address: 

**Aave v3 Arbitrum**
Address Reward (ARB): `0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548`
EMISSION_ADMIN: `0xE79C65a313a1f4Ca5D1d15414E0c515056dA90b4`

The AIP call setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract.

EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(ARB,EMISSION_ADMIN);

# Disclosure

TokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.

# Next Steps

1) Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.
2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage

title: [ARFC] LDO Emission_Admin for Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism v3 Liquidity Pools
Author: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting
Dated: 2023-01-26

---

# Summary

This proposal is to enable Lido to distribute LDO rewards across the Aave v3 Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism Liquidity Pools. The `Emission_Admin` role for LDO on each network is to be assigned to a wallet controlled by the Lido DAO.

# Abstract

Lido seeks to distribute LDO rewards across to the various Aave v3 deployments. To achieve this, the `EmissionManager` function assigns an owner to the `Emission_Admin` role for LDO on each respective Aave v3 deployment, [1,2].

The wallet with `Emission Admin` permission for LDO on each aave v3 deployment then controls the distribution of only LDO rewards across the respective Liquidity Pool.

# Motivation

Enable Lido DAO to distribute LDO rewards across the Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism v3 Liquidity Pools.

The Lido Liquidity Mining Committee (LMC) determines the emission rate and duration at which LDO rewards are offered.

Typically, the LMC meets and determines the next 30 days of LDO rewards on a rolling basis. This means each month, the committee will determine if to extend the LDO rewards, or change the amount of LDO being offered across the various Aave v3 Liquidity Pools.

# Specification

The `EmissionManager`, a governance controlled function, assigns the `Emission_Admin` role for a specified token, LDO.

The `Emission_Admin` role controls the distribution of the specified token, LDO, across the specified Aave deployments.

The `Emission_Admin` can distribute LDO anywhere across the Aave v3 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.

# Implementation

Set `Emission_Admin` permission for LDO to the following Lido address:

|Network|LDO Address|Emission Admin|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Ethereum|0x5A98FcBEA516Cf06857215779Fd812CA3beF1B32|0x87D93d9B2C672bf9c9642d853a8682546a5012B5|

641,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to hire a Head of Network Development to help oversee matters within theAPE Foundation, supporting our community in achieving its strategic goals and ensuring operational excellence. The Head of Network Development will be responsible for supporting daily operations, facilitating strategic planning, coordinating community engagement, and
representing the DAO in external affairs. Additionally, this role will be well-positioned to make recommendations for further improvements as needed. For clarity’s sake, this position does not equate to a chief executive officer or “leader”, but rather a critical support function for the APE Foundation and the DAO.

To optimize efficiency and create cost savings, this proposal also includes a proposed reduction in future Special Council members’ payments to offset the cost of this hire. The APE Foundation will be empowered to oversee the hiring process for this position, ensuring that all legal, tax, and other relevant considerations are thoroughly addressed and optimized. The Head of Network Development will serve at the pleasure of the Special Council, the DAO’s Advisory Board.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
As ApeCoin DAO continues to expand, the need for ongoing, dedicated, and professional support at the APE Foundation has become increasingly evident. A Head of Network Development will offer essential oversight, strategic facilitation, and operational management, ensuring the ApeCoin DAO fulfills its mission efficiently and effectively. This role is vital for maintaining momentum, building community trust, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the DAO. Additionally, this position will allow our Special Council to focus on their responsibilities as the Advisory Board they are intended to be.

##### OVERALL COST 
USD $120,000 per annum paid in $APE. However, we will reduce Special Council member payments to offset this cost. Effectively makes this proposal zero additional cost to the DAO up to USD $125,000 once the reduction of the Special Council members payments kicks in (January 1, 2025).

APE Foundation could use its discretionary authority to go over USD $125,000 per annum if a competitive salary for this role is deemed necessary.

642,"This proposal originally appeared on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799) and is faithfully reproduced here along with all proposed amendments.

# The Proposal
For the remaining two weeks of the [exchange gas reimbursement pilot](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705), expand the list of eligible tokens to include all whitelisted tokens (the same list that is eligible for BAL liquidity mining). The change would take effect starting at 00:00 UTC on Monday, February 8, and we would continue to allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy.

# Motivation
The pilot program has gone very smoothly so far, with 929 BAL being distributed to 441 addresses for the first week. Of these addresses, only 171 were LPs also participating in liquidity mining, meaning the other 270 were traders who gained the opportunity to participate alongside LPs in the ongoing distribution of BAL tokens. The second week of the pilot is not yet finished, but so far 1043 BAL are set to be distributed to 433 addresses, 342 of which are _not_ participating in liquidity mining. Only 86 reimbursed addresses are included in both weeks so far, meaning a total of 788 unique addresses have been or will be reimbursed.

For all of us in the Balancer community, the decentralized distribution of governance power  has always been a top priority. The liquidity mining program features an extensive list of over **400** eligible tokens and has been a key contributor to this decentralization, distributing BAL tokens to over **9,000** liquidity providers last week. In contrast, the gas reimbursement pilot so far has only included 5 eligible tokens in order to assess feasibility and reduce gameability at the outset.

But now that the basic, five-token version of the pilot has been validated, it is time to expand it to achieve the same degree of decentralization as the liquidity mining program. To ensure lasting robustness of the governance process, we need to get BAL tokens into the hands of as many Balancer users as possible; and that includes both liquidity providers and traders.

# Mechanics
The overarching mechanics of the gas reimbursement pilot would not change. Please see the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705) for details.

In lieu of the shortlist of eligible tokens included in the original proposal, we would use the existing [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json) used for liquidity mining. Swaps between any two of the tokens on the whitelist would be eligible for reimbursement of gas costs, with limits described in the original post and summarized here:

* Only transactions between an EOA account and the Balancer Exchange Proxy would be eligible. This roughly correlates to end users navigating the [Balancer Exchange UI](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap) and would not include DEX aggregators or most arbitrage bots.
* The maximum amount of gas to be reimbursed would be 100,000 units per swap, where there can be more than one swap in a single transaction (a swap is one leg of a multi-hop trade).
* The maximum gas price (in gwei) used would be the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block.
* Reimbursements would be made in BAL, not ETH, with the median BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko for the weekly period being used to convert.
* If the number of tokens to be distributed in a single week exceeds the 7,500 BAL budget, all reimbursements would be scaled down proportionally so that exactly 7,500 BAL are issued in total.
* Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.

# Amendment 1
If we detect any gaming of the reimbursement program, such as blatant wash trading, we would reserve the right to filter those addresses out of the distribution. We want this to be an opportunity for traders to safely utilize the Balancer Exchange without fear of having their reimbursements diluted by an attacker.",bearish
643,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Back Highstreet ($HIGH) to Syrup Pool!

CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from **Highstreet**. Highstreet is an open-world metaverse that incorporates shopping, gaming, NFTs, traditional and crypto brands in a massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).

#### What is Boost?

Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, the HIGH-BUSD farm will go to a 1x multiple for 48 hours, then 0.5x thereafter. Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the boosted period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BSC, fundamental token issues, etc.
 
At the same time, there will be a delicious, new HIGH Syrup Pool with 168,600 HIGH tokens to be earned by staking CAKE. Get your CAKE ready!


#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn HIGH tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 168,600 HIGH
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on February 25th 2022
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on April 26th 2022
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.09756 HIGH

#### Max Stake per wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### What is $HIGH?

From the team: “Highstreet is a decentralized metaverse where brands - both traditional and crypto, can use their Merchant Portal to seamlessly integrate and build their presence in Highstreet World.

HIGH is Highstreet's native token which provides holders with in-game access for game progression and access to special events, serves as an in-game currency, and can be used for on-chain governance.”

## title: [ARFC] ACI Phase II
author: @marczeller - Aave-chan Initiative
date: 2023-10-17

---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the continuation of the collaboration with the Aave-chan Initiative (ACI) for an additional period of 180 days, with a proposed budget of 375k GHO.

## Motivation

![image|1920x1097, 50%](upload://9xBM448LftJoHXyBmCPgIOHzLd7.jpeg)


The ACI has demonstrated significant value to the Aave ecosystem across multiple fronts. This proposal seeks to extend our collaboration, focusing on three primary axes: Skyward, Growth, and Representation.

### Skyward:

![image|2000x559](upload://22rgZUXRYxc6uOrlNotwo8BiZ6l.png)


Skyward has emerged as a cornerstone of Aave's governance, producing 90 AIPs in 180 days. This averages out to **[one AIP every other day](https://dune.com/alice_rozengarden/aip-creation-in-2023)**, a testament to the relentless dedication and efficiency of the ACI. Beyond numbers, the ACI has fostered a spirit of collaboration within the Aave ecosystem.

We've co-authored proposals with the vast majority of active DAO service providers, recognized delegates and some active community members. Moreover, our doors have always been open to third-party protocols. By actively welcoming and collaborating with them, we've streamlined the governance process, ensuring that Aave remains inclusive and cohesive in its approach.

**What to expect for phase II?**

Continuation & extension of the Skyward services.

### Growth:

![image|2000x1088](upload://qjlOWocj80wUPeSHio06wG9yJBp.jpeg)


The ACI operates under a guiding principle of ""**Continuous incremental improvement.**""

While we acknowledge that we might not be the driving force behind tech breakthroughs like a potential Aave V4 or, recently, the Governance V3 AIP, our daily commitment is unwavering. We aim to make the protocol 1% better every single day, one AIP at a time. It's through these consistent, small steps that we believe Aave can maintain its leadership in the DeFi space.

Our efforts have already borne fruit. The implementation of offboarding plans for assets like BUSD & TUSD stands out. These initiatives not only enhanced protocol safety but also turned a profit, generating close to 1M$ for the DAO. This revenue, in itself, has multiple times repaid the investment made in the ACI. Furthermore, our vigilant oversight of the DAO's finances has ensured efficiency. We've curbed overspending, optimized budgets, and deterred proposals that didn't align with Aave's best interests, saving the DAO a 7-figure amount & ensuring every GHO & DAO $ is well spent.

**What to expect for phase II?**

The ACI will continue to focus on our continuous incremental improvement doctrine, being a driving force in Aave protocol growth and BD.

For Phase II the main focal points will be on Liquid Staking Tokens diversity with the support of onboarding new assets, GHO growth and adoption with support of synergies and the integration of GHO in both onchain protocols, ramps & L2s.

### Representation:

The ACI has actively engaged in both internal and external representation for the Aave DAO.

**Internal Representation**:

Prior to the ACI's involvement, the DAO too often encountered challenges, such as proposals not reaching the required quorum. Governance activity was subdued, and the operations were notably insular. The ACI introduced several key initiatives:

- **Orbit Program**: The ACI allocated ~20% of its budget to the Orbit program, focusing on diversity. This program compensates recognized delegates for their contributions, leading to increased participation rates and improved diversity metrics. The frequency of proposals failing due to a lack of quorum has decreased. With the now DAO-funded Orbit program, **the DAO has enshrined these benefits**
- **Governance Guidelines**: The ACI contributed to the establishment of the Aave DAO governance guidelines. This effort aimed to bring clarity, predictability, and efficiency to DAO governance. The ""**Minimal Viable Bureaucracy**"" ACI Doctrine, ensures a balance between structured governance and accessibility.
- **Support for New Delegates**: The ACI has extended support to emerging delegate platforms, co-authoring proposals and providing guidance. This collaborative approach has enriched the DAO's ecosystem.

**What to Expect from Phase II?**

We will continue contributing to the Aave DAO frameworks and supporting DAO active participants seeking a balance between organization & accessibility.

We will also delegate engineering resources for service providers via mini-dapps such as the recent [acistreamcollector.com](http://acistreamcollector.com), which allows no code claims of DAO streams.

**External Representation**:

![image|1920x1423](upload://o68ggEFjWsJdbQHaC8hqxPvL6sV.jpeg)


Externally, the ACI has been a voice for the Aave DAO in various capacities.

- **Event Participation**: The ACI has participated in and sponsored several global events to share insights and collaborate with industry peers. In 2023, our engagements included:
    - Web3DNA (Paris)
    - EthDubai 2023
    - Prague DeFi Summit/EthPrague
    - Stable Summit (Paris)
    - EthCC[6] (Paris)
    - Dappcon Berlin 2023
    - LëtzStake (Luxembourg)
    - EthLisbon
    - Devconnect Istanbul
    
    A detailed list of our engagements can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/f676c1ce96f44c648ef2a40f7f1bb442?pvs=21).
    
- **Regulatory Engagement**: The ACI's founder holds the position of president of the DeFi committee of the French Lobby ADAN. This role involves dialogues with regulators, institutions, and governments in France and Europe regarding the DeFi sector. The ACI has been involved in discussions related to the ""Mica 2"" regulation, which addresses DeFi services.

The ACI, as one of the voices for the Aave DAO, has consistently worked towards enhancing the DAO's presence and reputation in the broader ecosystem.

**What to Expect from Phase II?**

The ACI will continue to be one of the voices of Aave across the globe, supporting devs in hackathons, being one of the DAO voices during events and supporting our brand quality.

645,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp-2-0/2548).

# Motivation 

Almost four months ago, Balancer’s governance process was formally overhauled and handed off to the DAO through [this proposal](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x3bbcaaad4f0a928b8dabaf97bfd9679752254aee6e63597df32a7453663354d6). Overall I would argue the revamp did increase the transparency and effectiveness of our governance process but some critical problems have become clear to me lately.

The ultimate authority of our governance process is BAL token holders. Currently, in order for a proposal to proceed for a vote it must have a majority of the Gov Council signal that the proposal has reached “soft consensus in the community”. Ballers and DAO contributors represent the majority of active community members. It’s not a stretch to imagine a scenario where large token holders support a proposal but the Ballers/active community do not. We have created a system where the Gov Council acts as gatekeepers with full control over what proceeds to a vote and what doesn’t.

Thus, I would make the argument that “soft consensus in the community” should NOT be a factor when considering a proposal to move forward to a vote. We must avoid the situation where core DAO contributors are against a proposal that has large token holder support, and that proposal does not proceed to a vote because it lacks “soft consensus in the community”.

# Specification

The Gov Council will remain in place and their approval will still be required for a proposal to move to a vote. However, they will not vote on whether “soft consensus in the community” has been reached. Instead, the question will be “Is this a well defined proposal?”

What is the criteria for a “well defined” proposal?

* Includes a “Motivation”, “Specification”, and if applicable a “Risks” section
* If on-chain execution from the DAO Multisig is required, the “Specification” section must contain transaction details (address to send funds to, contract to interact with/function to call, etc)
* The intent of the proposal must be clear (not spam)
* BAL token holders must have the power to implement the proposal
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deposit the FEI in our treasury into a new degen farm. As part of the [subDAO formation proposal](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66), the power to farm was delegated to the Treasury subDAO. BAL token holders cannot vote on how we farm with non-BAL treasury assets, so this proposal would not proceed to a vote. However, a proposal to remove the power to farm from the Treasury subDAO is within the scope of BAL token holders. If this proposal passes successfully, then the proposal to farm with FEI could go to a vote.
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deploy Balancer to Optimism. Balancer Labs has sole discretion over core protocol development. BAL token holders do not have the power to compel Balancer Labs to act. It is solely the choice of Balancer Labs to create an official deployment of Balancer on Optimism, or not. Thus, this proposal would not proceed to a vote as BAL token holders lack the power to implement it.
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deposit 100k BAL to Aave to earn a yield. BAL token holders have the power to allocate BAL held in the treasury, so as long as the other criteria for a “well defined” proposal are met, this would proceed to a vote.

If the Gov Council fails to execute their duties in good faith and votes against a “well defined” proposal proceeding to a vote, a proposal to replace the Gov Council with a different mechanism should be made ASAP.

**Finally, this proposal would also implement a required minimum quorum of 100k BAL. Any snapshot vote that does not reach 100k total BAL voted AND at least 51% voting in favor would be considered to fail.**",bullish

647,"#### ABSTRACT

TL;DR - ApeCoin DAO needs professional Marketing, PR & Communications. This charter details what an initial infrastructure could/should entail, provides foundational branding support & IP usage guidelines, and creates an environment for the majority of initiatives to spring forth from the community.

The goal of this proposal is to help establish the ApeCoin DAO Marketing and Communications Working Group. The Marketing and Communications Working Group’s mandate is to:

“Propose a consistent and compelling brand strategy and identity for the ApeCoin DAO, propose and implement comprehensive marketing and communications strategies, and help establish a strong presence through effective global communication efforts in order to onboard more users into the DAO.”

Working Groups enable a sustainable community-led infrastructure that further decentralizes the DAO, creates operational efficiency, and is flexible enough to adapt to any opportunities that may arise. The guidelines for how this Working Group will function are proposed in AIP-239.

#### OVERALL COST

$0
* This AIP serves as an initial framework to establish this Working Group. The three elected Stewards will propose a budget 1-3 weeks after being onboarded.

Most don't even add much just want you to have to unstake and stake again paying more and more fees taking away from profits.

## Summary:

This proposal aims to progress a 6-month relationship between Aave and Flipside Crypto, creating sustainable frameworks, resources, and operational support.

This proposal incorporates key feedback from existing service providers and the community, shifting the scope to focus on existing capabilities and operational efficiency.

## Motivation:

Flipside has been a long-standing steward of Aave, contributing to multiple initiatives. We have been a previous grant recipient, 2nd ever delegate, and strategic growth partner.

This proposal seeks to cement Flipside’s role and further invest in services and resources toward a more sustainable, more engaged, and clearer future.

In particular, the proposal addresses increased diversity in the delegate base, up-to-date documentation, framework development, data availability, and community resources.

This proposal is aimed to be a low-cost way of introducing and investing in these services while encouraging delivery and a short renewal.

## Specification:

To initiate the service contract, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with flipsidecrypto2.eth (0x1ef753934C40a72a60EaB12A68B6f8854439AA78) as the recipient.

In terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()`method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a 180-day stream of 125,000 USDC. If successful, Flipside will offer and perform the following services on a 6-month basis:

## Background
The [Child Chain Gauge Factory V2](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20230316-child-chain-gauge-factory-v2) is the Layer Zero replacement for the old Child Chain Streamer style gauges.  These new gauges will enable veBAL boost to be extended to non-mainnet chains.

Beyond emitting BAL, Balancer Gauges have the ability to emit other externally provided tokens.  Projects such as Lido and Polygon have used this capability in the past to provide direct emissions to stakers.

In for a token to be used in a reward gauge, the add_reward function must be called on the gauge with the specified token.  This BIP Grants the Balancer Maxis the ability to manage external rewards tokens on gauges, and authorizes them to make decisions about what tokens to add based on their best judgement and in collaboration with other Balancer Service Providers.

## Risk Assessment
The main risk to adding external tokens to a gauge are that it could be used to distribute spam coins or other mallicious tokens through the gauge system.  The Balancer Maxis have demonstrated themselves as well qualified being both permissive but sensible.

# Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list alUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave. alUSD has established itself as one of the leading new stablecoins in terms of stability and liquidity, and listing on Aave will provide users with a proven stablecoin to borrow. Alchemix has 376m TVL in the form of yvDAI and DAI backing alUSD, with a liquid supply of 239m alUSD. alUSD has one of the deepest Curve pools, with ~450m in liquidity. In addition to the Curve pool, alUSD has additional liquidity on Sushiswap, Saddle, and mStable. According to Parsec Finance’s StableRank, alUSD is routinely among the top stablecoins in terms of price stability and liquidity within 1% slippage. Having been on the market for over 6 months while maintaining the peg through turbulent market conditions, alUSD has built the reputation required to be an asset listed on AAVE.

# About Alchemix and alUSD
Alchemix is an evolution of the tried and true CDP model trailblazed by MakerDAO. Alchemix is, at its core, an overcollateralized stablecoin, much like DAI and other similar tokens. It has some key differences however.

Alchemix only mints like-kind or “mirror” al-Assets. For example, alUSD is only mintable by DAI (and later USDT and USDC), and alETH is only mintable by ETH (and later other ETH derivatives). Deposited collateral is then deployed to yearn, of which the earned yield doubly repays users’ debt and backs the dollar peg in the Transmuter module. In addition, there is no interest paid in the borrowing of al-Assets. Due to this structure, Alchemix does not have liquidations in its system. This allows people to maximum borrow without fear of shifting market conditions - taking an essentially risk free negative interest alUSD loan with their DAI. In effect, the system acts as a way to get an advance on your yield for your stablecoin deposits.

Alchemix ensures the alUSD peg with the following mechanisms.
1. 50% LTV for minting alUSD, which prevents excessive recursive leverage in the protocol.
2. DAO-managed debt caps that limit the over-minting of alUSD
3. The ability to repay debt in alUSD or DAI. If alUSD is under the peg, people can buy it off the market and repay their loan at a discount. If alUSD is over the peg, users can sell alUSD to DAI and repay with DAI to arbitrage the price, and they can self-liquidate their collateral to mint more alUSD to trade to DAI for arbitrage.
4. The Transmuter module guarantees 1:1 conversions of alUSD to DAI, the conversion process isn’t instant, but it can present good arbitrage opportunities, which helps to stabilize the peg.
5. Alchemix rewards ALCX governance tokens for alUSD liquidity providers, which attracts liquidity to the pool, further boosting the peg.

alUSD minted from a new loan has a collateralization ratio of 200%, while alUSD minted from repaid debt has a collateralization ratio of 100%. The total global collateralization ratio for alUSD is 157%. The supply can expand in two ways – an expansion in the debt ceiling followed by users taking new loans, or debt repayments with DAI, which decrement the global debt while not destroying alUSD. This is how we have a supply of ~239m with a current debt cap of 150m. alUSD can be burned by staking it in the transmuter, where it is converted 1:1 to DAI over time.

These mechanisms in tandem have allowed for alUSD to remain extremely close to the $1 peg since its inception.

# Motivation
alUSD has established itself as a reliable and liquid stablecoin. In addition to protocol improvements, Alchemix DAO believes that integrating alUSD throughout DeFi will help us in that goal. Because AAVE is the leading lending protocol across all of crypto, getting on AAVE as a borrowable asset would lend a lot of legitimacy to alUSD. The more tightly integrated alUSD is within DeFi, the more resilient it will become, which will allow alUSD to safely grow in supply.

Going forward, Alchemix will expand beyond our current set up of using DAI in the yvDAI yearn vault as collateral, and expand the selection of stablecoin collaterals and yield earning strategies. AAVE is one such source of yield that we are looking to plug into in the future. When these upgrades take place, we predict that Alchemix will be one of the larger liquidity providers to AAVE, similar to how Alchemix is currently one of the largest liquidity providers on Yearn.

# alUSD Benefits to Aave Users
alUSD is desirable to borrow because it is tightly pegged to DAI, USDC, USDT, mUSD, FEI, FRAX, and LUSD in our various markets. It is simple to swap between other stables. DEX aggregators make it simple to trade between alUSD and any other asset on Ethereum too. In addition, there are attractive farming incentives for alUSD LPs. For people that are looking to borrow alUSD but don’t have stablecoins from which to mint it, borrowing alUSD on AAVE will provide more options to get alUSD. The alUSD can be used for yield farming, or through highly liquid swaps into other stable coins, to finance their personal life or to speculate on the market. alUSD is also used in an alETH/alUSD options market on premia.finance. Alchemix plans to continue to expand alUSD use cases in the future through partnerships and integrations.

# Security Considerations and Risk Analysis
Certik Audit for the Core Contracts: https://alchemix.fi/a208baf6ca7e0d6b0116461f05e27cd9.pdf

Currently, the Alchemix protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol controls the alUSD debt cap and collateralization ratio through DAO voting, which is then executed by a community + developer multisig + timelock contract. The DAO prioritizes peg stability above all else when considering parameter changes.

Aave has already conducted risk analysis on DAI, the current sole backing stablecoin of alUSD, and assigned an overall risk rating of B+ [Risks per Asset - Risk](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risks-per-asset). USDC and USDT strategies will be added as alUSD collateral later. USDC and USDT have ratings of A- and B+ respectively. The new risks from introducing alUSD are Alchemix/alUSD and Yearn Vault contract risks. Risk to Aave is minimized due to alUSD being enabled for borrowing but not as collateral.

The Alchemix DAO multisig and timelock wallet is the administrator for the alUSD token. It has the ability to grant and revoke other contracts the minter role. Currently, all alUSD minting is handled by the alchemist.sol contract. When we launch our version two, the new contracts will also be granted the minting permissions. Alchemix employs a modular approach where the Transmuter and Vault Adapter modules can be swapped out and replaced with upgraded versions. The core alchemist.sol contract cannot be upgraded, but the multisig and timelock wallet can change the following parameters: collateralization ratio, debt ceiling, and fee percentage. Each member of the core Alchemix development team has permission to enable Alchemix’s sentinel mode, which pauses the contract in case of an emergency.

660,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes MetisDAO ($METIS) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with MetisDAO! MetisDAO is a Layer 2 scaling infrastructure to support the Web3 economy in a multichain world.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn METIS tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 11,500 METIS
 - **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on May 16th 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on June 15th 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.01331 METIS 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the METIS Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a METIS-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the farm period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.

#### What is $METIS?

From the team: “Metis is an Layer 2 scaling infrastructure that supports the running of a Web3 economy. With the advanced Metis network, DApps and users can achieve lower costs, higher transaction speeds, higher scalability and enjoy the native security inherited from Ethereum. MetisDAO is also building a new multichain (Ethereum, BNB Chain, etc.) Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework and Reputation Power Matrix to support the building and operation of a Web3 economy.

The use cases of METIS are as follows:
* Paying for Fees: Pay for network gas fees on the Metis network
* Governance: To vote on CEG (Community Ecosystem Governance) and upcoming Ecosystem Nodes
* Network incentives: Rewarding and incentivizing developers, verifiers, sequencers and rangers”

**Protocol Description:**

Manifold Finance enables and provides access to high-value transaction pools on EVM compatible chains, through our infrastructure: *SecureRPC* . They aggregate multiple endpoints along with maintaining direct access to disparate mining pools/validator nodes (Flashbots, Eden, Miners).

**Motivation:**

Current onchain liquidity is sitting at only 300k while generating in the past few days over 4m$ in volume incentives & bribes to deepen liquidity at this stage of growth is key for Manifold.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** 

Governance utilizes an architecture of elected dictator. By staking FOLD tokens, you delegate protocol control to one address (the dictator). The dictator offers a tribute (rewards) for your support. Accounts that are participating in the dictator regime may elect to vote for a new supreme dictator (operator/management for the protocol) by removing their support and reallocating it towards a new address.  
Source : https://github.com/manifoldfinance/majordomo

A known attack vector involving sandwich staking is mitigated by manually disbursing tributes. This attack vector will be mitigated by a time-dependent withdrawal period in our V2 Vault upgrade. 

> Note that this attack vector has never been actually realized, as it was caught beforehand

Protocol Fees are immediately collected in a vault which then distributes it over time (the time withdrawal is to prevent MEV attacks against the protocol in which accounts enter/exit during certain periods of time). 

A Multisig address is available. The multisig only holds tokens for the purposes of voting in governance proposals of other DAO's. This will be migrated to a vault-based permissive action list structure in which the tokens are held in-vault, with certain permissions enabled for the operator address only. 

2. **Oracles:**

Additionally they maintain the DeFi Threat Matrix which is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations on decentralized finance

4. **Centralization vectors:** 

They utilize a concept of Permissive Action List to enable a two-step ownership process for any partner integrations. 

Centralization risks include but are not limited to:

GitHub - we perform off site backups and coordination in the event of GitHub deleting the manifoldfinance org (see LMDBX event for an example).

Google Services: We utilize a domain name not administered by Google for internal services such as user registration, etc. This is not the manifoldfinance.com email address.

Governance Discussions occur on a centralized service, Discourse. [see forums.manifoldfinance.com](https://forums.manifoldfinance.com)

There are also certain account addresses with a large amount of FOLD tokens. However we feel that due to the 'unique' governance regime that this is not in practice a risk factor as it would normally be under traditional DAO governance structures. 

5. **Market History:** 

Pool has been activated in the past 14 days and saw over 225k volume since inception on approximately 84k$ BPT with a current APR of 256% & fees of 1200$ in the past 24h.

6. **Value:** 

Current pool on Sushiswap is where the majority of LP are with only 3% APY emissions we can't guarantee or force people to move over but with theses BAL rewards and potential bribes it should be a no-brainer :)",bullish

title: [ARFC] Ethereum v2 Reserve Factor Adjustment
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic @ChaosLabs
created: 2024-02-27

---

# Summary

This publication proposes periodically increasing the Aave v2 Ethereum Reserve Factor (RF) to encourage users to migrate to Aave v3.

# Motivation

With Aave v3 now crossing the $8 Billion TVL threshold and $3 Billion remaining in Aave v2, this publication seeks to encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3 by increasing the RF.

With all other variables held constant, increasing the RF over time in isolation will result in a reducing deposit rate. Users are encourage to migrate to v3 in search of higher yield.

With market conditions permitting, we propose initiating a periodic 5.00% RF increase across all assets every 14 days as mentioned [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766) up to a threshold of 99.99%. During each increase cycle, we will monitor how users respond and, if any potential risks are identified, the next RF increase will be delayed until it is safe to implement.

Do note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect users' health factor, and this method has already been [implemented on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350) for some time. 

# Specification

The below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.

| renFIL| 35.00%| 99.99% |
| SNX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| sUSD | 30.00% | 35.00% |
| SUSHI| 99.00% | 99.99% |
| TUSD | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| UNI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| USDC | 25.00% | 30.00% |

666,"# PancakeSwap Welcomes MCDEX ($MCB) to Syrup Pool!



CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from MCDEX, an AMM-based decentralized perpetual swap protocol.




# The Syrup Pool:
Stake CAKE tokens to earn MCB tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 12,200 MCB
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start block:** #11793300 **[(approx. 12pm UTC on October 15th)](https://www.bscscan.com/block/countdown/11793300)**
- **Finish block:** #13521300 **[(approx. 12pm UTC on December 14th)](https://www.bscscan.com/block/countdown/13521300)**
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.00706 MCB


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.


# The Farm:
In order to host MCDEX’s MCB Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a MCB-BNB farm that will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, and then 0.5x CAKE rewards after that. 


# What is MCDEX?
From the team: “MCDEX is an AMM-based decentralized perpetual swap protocol. Perpetual swap is one of the most popular derivatives that has no expiration date, supports margin trading, and has its price soft pegged to index price.

The goal of MCDEX is to allow anyone to create and trade in any perpetual market. To start with, anyone can create their own perpetual market with the price feed of the underlying asset and choose any ERC20 as collateral. Secondly, the team has designed an AMM for the perpetual market and this AMM also has better capital efficiency. Moreover, AMM solves the liquidity problem - anyone can provide liquidity to AMM by depositing assets in the pool and get a reasonable market making profit. Finally, anyone can trade perpetual swaps permissionlessly. Traders’ assets are in the smart contract in a noncustodial way and the process of trading are conducted completely onchain.

Permissionless is the key feature of the protocol, which can empower the whole community to contribute to the MCDEX ecosystem - anyone can create the perpetual market of an on-chain or off-chain synthetic assets.”

### Background: 
Uniswap’s [genesis liquidity incentive program](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) ended on Nov 17. The program distributed 20 million UNI to LPs over 2 months, split evenly between the WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, and DAI/ETH pools. This worked out to 2.5 million UNI per pool, per month.

#### Benefits of UNI distribution to LPs:
Ongoing incentives allows UNI to be distributed to those providing value in the form of liquidity
The incentivized pools are likely to remain the most liquid DEX pair on Ethereum, providing a venue to trade against ETH at virtually any size with zero slippage.
Reduced incentives prevents UNI from being distributed ‘too fast’, marked by all tokens being distributed before the Foundation’s four year vesting has passed.

#### Drawbacks of UNI distribution to LPs:
Ongoing incentives result in UNI largely being ‘farmed and dumped’ to earn yield. See ETH USD Yield Farm, Pickle, Harvest and Alpha.
Reduced incentives means UNI is distributed slower.
Incentivizing the same pools can be seen as choosing ‘winners’ by selecting WBTC as THE Bitcoin on Ethereum and favoring certain stablecoins over others.

### Proposed new distribution: 
Distribute UNI for an additional 2 months from the time this proposal is adopted and executed by governance, but at half the rate of the previous distribution (5 million UNI per month instead of 10 million UNI per month). 

**Note that pool distributions were adjusted slightly from the previous [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-distribute-uni-to-liquidity-providers/8591) process**. Reasoning behind this adjustment can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590/68). 

UNI will be distributed to the following 4 pools:
WBTC/ETH - 1.67 million UNI per month, ⅓ of total
USDC/ETH - 1.25 million UNI per month, ¼ of total
USDT/ETH - 1.25 million UNI per month, ¼ of total
DAI/ETH - 0.83 million UNI per month, ⅙ of total

Please see the liquidity incentive [governance plan document](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590) for full details and timelines. 

### Consensus check question:

Should Uniswap distribute UNI to liquidity providers per the specifications outlined above?

### Next steps:
The previous [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-distribute-uni-to-liquidity-providers/8591) process passed with sufficient support of UNI voters. The following consensus check poll is the second phase of Uniswap’s [governance process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732).

The snapshot poll will be live for 5 days. If the poll passes with a minimum of 50,000 UNI in support, this initiative will move forward as a formal governance proposal.

## Redeem Collector Contract aTokens, Transfer Treasury and Deposit Aave v3

As has been widely discussed on the forum, Aave v3 offers enhanced risk management tools and presents a lower risk environment to users. Here, we propose that v2 aTokens be redeemed and transferred to the v3 Treasury address. From the v3 Treasury address, the tokens can be deposited into Aave v3.

Utilisation across the v2 deployment is low and there is excess liquidity within each reserve that enables Aave's aTokens to be redeemed without affecting users.

Llama proposes migrating liquidity at the first available opportunity. There is also ongoing and soon to be expanded liquidity mining occurring on the Aave v3 deployment. 

## Consolidate Assets

Similar to a proposal relating to the [Ethereum v2 Collector Contract consolidation](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-ethereum-v2-collector-contract-consolidation/10909), we suggest swapping all JEUR, SUSHI, GHST + DPI to USDT. 

The general flow of events is redeeming xSUSHI, GHST and DPI from the v3 Treasury and then swapping the assets for USDT.

|Network|Deployment|Ticker|Price|Quantity|USD Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolDPI|$70.85|2.29| $ 161.96 |
|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolSUSHI|$1.27|2,055.89| $ 2,610.97 |
|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolJEUR|$1.05|2,622.03| $ 2,753.13 |
|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolGHST|$1.04|2,788.45| $ 2,899.98 |
|||||Total| $ 8,426.05 |

Why USDT, Aave holds more DAI and USDC on Polygon than USDT. If Aave was to deploy liquidity into a 3pool, then more USDT would be required when depositing equal amounts of each asset into the pool. The vlaue of the assets being swapped to USDT is very small relative to exisitng stable coin holdings. 

# Specification

The following assets held within the v2 Collector Contract are to be redeemed and transferred to the v3 Treasury wallet.

Using 1inch's Fusion in auto mode perform the following:

1. Redeem aPolGHST, aPOLjEUR, aPolSUSHI and aPolDPI
2. Approve GHST, JEUR, SUSHI and DPI
3. Swap all GHST, JEUR, SUSHI and DPI to USDT
4. Deposit USDT into Aave v3 USDT Reserve

Fusion offers MEV protection and Cowswap is not deployed on Polygon.

Join us in welcoming Santos FC to PancakeSwap IFO! If this vote passes, you’ll be able to buy $SANTOS tokens with CAKE during the token launch.

This time, based on experience from last time, we've heavily adjusted the participation fee tiers to make sure the fee model covers more extreme cases of overflow. See below for more details.

# What is Santos FC Fan Token?
 
The **Santos FC Fan Token** is a BEP-20 utility token designed to revolutionize the fan experience for all Santos FC supporters. The token empowers Santos FC fans to participate in team voting polls, hunt digital collectibles, purchase NFTs, and enjoy gamification features that are tied to fan rewards or great experiences.

# What is $SANTOS? 

SANTOS is the official Binance Fan Token for Santos FC and will have use cases such as giving holders the right to participate in the fan engagement-related voting sessions on the Binance Fan Token platform, loyalty subscription programs, purchasing of Santos FC merchandise and matchday tickets, special fan benefits, access to gamification features on the Binance Fan Token platform, and for donations.

# $SANTOS Token Distribution

![](https://i.imgur.com/J3TDQaW.png)

Following the IFO, approximately 15.2% of the total supply will be circulating in the market.

# IFO Sales Details  
- **Sale start time:** Approx. 1030am UTC on Wednesday 1st December 2021
- **Sale end time:** Approx. 11am UTC on Wednesday 1st December 2021
- **Amount to be raised:** $1,000,000 USD in **CAKE tokens**
- **Tokens to be sold:** 400,000 SANTOS (1.3% of initial SANTOS total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 SANTOS = $2.50 USD

All CAKE raised from the Unlimited Sale’s participation fee will be BURNED!

Method: Basic Sale and Unlimited Sale (Both sales will be conducted via the Overflow method)

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

TLDR: The more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent.

You can subscribe as much or as little as you want to the IFO, and your final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in, as a % of all funds put in by other users. You'll get any leftover funds back when claiming your tokens after the sale.

# To join the IFO:

#### Before Sale:
- [**Activate your PancakeSwap profile**](https://pancakeswap.finance/profile)
- [**Buy CAKE**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/swap)

#### During Sale:

While the sale's live, commit your CAKE tokens to buy SANTOS at [*pancakeswap.finance/ifo*](https://pancakeswap.finance/ifo)

#### After Sale:

When the sale's complete, claim your SANTOS tokens. Any unspent CAKE will also be sent back to you.

Done!

If you decide to acquire CAKE tokens before the IFO starts, you can stake them [***here***](https://pancakeswap.finance/pools) to earn CAKE token rewards while waiting for the sale.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Basic Sale ($500,000, which is 50% of Sale allocation)

- Every wallet can contribute a MAXIMUM of $100 equivalent in CAKE tokens.
- The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session, but the good news is you’re not battling any whales.

![](https://imgur.com/EzQ5gmI.jpg)

#### Unlimited Sale ($500,000, which is 50% of Sale Allocation)

- No limits on the amount each person can contribute.
- However, this comes at the cost of a 1% participation fee, which is only applied to your contribution to the “Unlimited” session.
- All CAKE proceeds from the participation fee will be BURNED!

The participation fee decreases in cliffs, based on the percentage of overflow from the “Unlimited” portion of the sale as such:

Here are some example scenarios:

![](https://i.imgur.com/dT1FZfL.png)

Please note — The final USD price per CAKE token will be set a few minutes before the sale (starting at approx. 1030am UTC on Wednesday 1st December 2021) and will be broadcasted on all channels.

We’ll also be running a Syrup Pool and Farm for SANTOS, which will start shortly after the IFO ends.

# The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn SANTOS!

- **Total Tokens:** 100,000 SANTOS
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends
- **Finish time:** Approx. 60 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.0578 SANTOS

# The Farm:

We’ll host a SANTOS-BNB LP farm, with 2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 1x rewards after that.

This proposal puts in place a Comms Team to establish communication channels in order to increase the flow of news, information and educational content within the ApeCoin ecosystem - working group name, ApeComms.

Recent Twitter posts and proposals regarding council elections, staking delays, bug bounties, etc have highlighted the need for clear, concise and consistent communications between the Special Council, Ape Foundation and the ApeCoin DAO.

The ApeComms team will administer information between the community, the Ape Foundation, and related entities and serve to increase Awareness, Participation, and Education of token holders by curating new channels for communication.

#### PROPOSAL

*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",bullish

## Summary

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient.
The protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. 

agEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there.

At the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero.

There are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/polygon/pools/0x3fa147d6309abeb5c1316f7d8a7d8bd023e0cd80) and on [Curve](https://polygon.curve.fi/factory/209). 
Besides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.

Stablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism.

The stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).
The protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.

agEUR has a Chainlink feed on Polygon with USD.

## Audits

We have had four different audits which can be found [here](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits)

## Benefits for Aave V3

agEUR is already supported in efficiency mode with other stablecoins which should technically allow people to take leverage on Forex, or to arb more easily stablecoins at peg.

One thing that is not supported at the moment is borrowing against agEUR as a collateral. This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the € and short the $ through agEUR.

Right now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the €. This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future.

Relative to the size of agEUR on Aave, there’s also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment.

Doing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.



## Risk Parameters

With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters.

V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon

## Specifications 

**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**  
As mentioned in the disclaimer, I am a Core Contributor of the Angle Protocol.

**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**  
See agEUR summary section

**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**  
See Benefits for Aave section.

**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?).**  

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, it is ruled by the ANGLE token and more generally by the veANGLE token. Like many other projects, Angle DAO has indeed adopted the ve tokenomics. 

The platform was released [on November 3rd 2021.](https://blog.angle.money/angle-is-live-on-the-ethereum-mainnet-a8253162daf0).
ANGLE locking went live [in January](https://blog.angle.money/veangle-is-live-on-mainnet-4d702fcf7584). Votes by veANGLE holders are implemented by a 4/6 multisig composed of 3 core team members (including myself), [Julien Bouteloup](https://twitter.com/bneiluj), [0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xMaki) and [SebVentures](https://twitter.com/SebVentures).

**5. How is the asset currently used?**  

The asset is a € stablecoin. It is used by people as a means of exchange to pay in Euros in DeFi, or to keep a stable asset value in reserves before aping in elsewhere.

It is also used as a way to get yield in many places in DeFi

**6. Emission schedule**  

Token can only be issued following the rules of the protocol on mainnet: at oracle value if someone has provided either USDC, DAI, FEI, FRAX, or wETH. agEUR can also be borrowed from Angle Borrowing module at a 0.5% rate. 
There’s no emission schedule for the token.

**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**  

agEUR token contract on mainnet is upgradeable and can be upgraded by the [multisig ](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xdC4e6DFe07EFCa50a197DF15D9200883eF4Eb1c8/balances) described above.
agEUR on Polygon can also be upgraded by a [multisig on Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xdA2D2f638D6fcbE306236583845e5822554c02EA).

**8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**

-   **Market Cap**: €48.7m circulating, €3.7m on Polygon, market cap = FDV
-   **24h Volume**: $4m (from [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ageur?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=WkIOj7Yl4CFERft4Q_gDG0LX9Ge3tf4LZpdCsXbQyng-1639642129-0-gaNycGzNCVE)) and this does not take into account Curve liquidity
-   **Volatility**: Low
-   **Maturity**: Early

**9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)**

-   **Discord**: 27.7k members ([invitation link](https://discord.gg/bsfZjvgx2s))

This is a proposal to allocate some small portion of the Balancer ecosystem grant fund toward public goods.

We developers and community members of the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement recognize that, more often than not, we stand on the shoulders of giants. Decentralized Finance (DeFi), as well as the wider Ethereum and cryptoasset ecosystem, is a group effort and we can all do our part to make this technological revolution a reality. As a core building block within DeFi, the Balancer protocol directly benefits from any and all growth within the DeFi economy. As such, it would behoove us all to give back to the community that has enabled Balancer’s unparalleled growth over the last several months. Let’s help plant the seeds for some of next big Ethereum projects.

[Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/?) Round 7 began three days ago on September 15 and will run until October 2. Let’s get this proposal passed this weekend so that the Balancer community can become a matching partner for this round!

The following are the proposed options for a lump sum public goods contribution to Gitcoin Grants Round 7. The BAL tokens to be donated will be taken from the Balancer ecosystem grant fund.

686,"## [Payload PR - BIP-214](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/110)

## Background
A new version of the primary relayer,  [BatchRelayer 5.0](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20230314-batch-relayer-v5).
Deployment of the fifth BalancerRelayer using BatchRelayerLibrary, for combining multiple operations (swaps, joins, etc.) in a single transaction.

This new version provides full support for all versions of Stable Pools: in particular, V2 and higher, which support proportional joins and exits. It also adds support for many new protocol wrappers: CompoundV2 (Midas), Euler, Gearbox, Silo, Tetu, and Yearn as well as other new protocols that use  a similar wrapper wrapper.

## Summary:
This ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add RPL to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Motivation
Rocket Pool is Ethereum 2.0 staking. The protocol reduces ETH 2.0 staking capital and hardware requirements to increase Ethereum's decentralisation and security. Rocket Pool lets customers stake trustlessly to a network of node operators to do this.
The Ethereum 2.0 base protocol requires 32 ETH, technical competence, and a machine with a CPU processor with four cores and a minimum clock speed of 2.80 gigahertz. Without a way to lessen the costs to admission for ETH holders, these restrictions would endanger decentralisation and network security. Even if consumers could stake, their ETH would be illiquid until a predefined lock-up period, which would degrade the staker experience. Rocket Pool users will be locked up until Ethereum 2.0 phase 2.

#### _Isolation mode_
Adding support for RPL on Ethereum V3 in isolated mode would allow RPL holders to borrow stablecoins by leveraging their RPL position, boosting the RPL stablecoin utlization rate and attracting new RPL Deposits.

#### _Oracles_
Ongoing integration via Chainlink.

## Specification

#### _What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?_

StableLabs & ACI have no link and are not compensated to present this TEMP CHECK proposal

#### _Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token._

RPL Token Ethereum Address: 0xD33526068D116cE69F19A9ee46F0bd304F21A51f

#### _Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?_
RPL is the governance and utility token for RocketPool, as the governance token for a major decentralized liquid staking derivative protocol, RocketPool has solidified itself as a Protocol which is actively contributing to Ethereum’s decentralization by making Operating a Node easy and accessible. By supporting RPL on Aave V3 Ethereum we would create an alternative for RPL holders who wish to earn yield on their asset.

#### _Non-collateral onboarding_
Adding support for RPL on Ethereum V3 as a non-collateral asset would allow RPL holders to obtain a yield on their RPL holdings. Users will borrow RPL mainly to allow them to deploy mini-pools and start staking.

#### _Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?_
As it became evident that Ethereum would switch from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, David Rugendyke established Rocket Pool in 2016. A minimum of 32 ETH, some technical know-how, and a computer with a CPU processor with four cores and a minimum clock speed of 2.80 gigahertz would be needed to validate on the Ethereum 2.0 base protocol. 
These obstacles would endanger the network's decentralisation and security in the absence of a solution that lowered the admission barriers for ETH holders. Additionally, even if users were able to stake, their ETH would stay non-liquid until a predefined lock-up period had passed, which would worsen the stakers' user experience. Users will be subject to his lock-up period until phase 2 of the rollout of Ethereum 2.0, even on Rocket Pool.

#### _How is RPL currently used?_
RPL is actively being used to power the RocketPool Protocol, the RPL mechanics are used in multiple key places to drive the protocol forward.
— rETH value is protected by node operators staking RPL as insurance for a proper service. In the event that node operators perform poorly, the staked RPL is used as insurance.
— The RocketPool Protocol also has Oracle DAO members who post RPL bonds as an assurance of good behavior.
—  RPL is also used in RocketPool Protocol DAO Governance.
RPL is also being used to provide liquidity on Uniswap and Balancer

#### _Emission schedule_
RPL is distributed as follows 15% for Oracle DAO members who contribute a variety of Oracle data, 70% for node operators who stake RPL as insurance collateral, and another 15% for the Protocol DAO Treasury, which supports decentralized development.

#### _Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?_
The RocketPool Protocol is owned and managed by the RocketPool Protocol DAO. The RocketPool DAO runs a Snapshot Subspace where they vote on Governance Proposals. 

RPL Contract: [0xD33526068D116cE69F19A9ee46F0bd304F21A51f](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd33526068d116ce69f19a9ee46f0bd304f21a51f)

The direction of the RocketPool protocol is shaped by the Rocket Pool Protocol DAO (pDAO), which is managed by RPL governance. A square root modifier transmits pDAO voting power from node operators' effective staked RPL.
Within Rocket Pool, Node Operators may submit and vote on new Rocket Pool Improvement Proposals (RPIP). For RPL, the RocketPool DAO controls all admin actions.

If any of the terms are unclear, please ask our friendly community, or read this article on [**vesting**](https://t.co/h2EoYCwJPs).

Please also note that, 

# IFO Sale Details  
- **Sale start time:** ~1200 UTC on Tue 18 Oct 2022 
- **Sale end time:** ~1400 UTC on Tue 18 Oct 2022 
- **Amount to be raised:** $1,200,000 USD in CAKE tokens
- **Tokens to be sold:** 40,000,000 WMX (4.0% of WMX total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 WMX = $0.030 USD
- **Token Vesting Schedule:** 20% will be unlocked at Sale end time (~1400 UTC), with the remaining 80% released block-by-block over 90 days.

All CAKE raised from the WMX token sale will be given to the IFO project. Only CAKE raised from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Public Sale and Private Sale (Both conducted via the Overflow method).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

Basically, the more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent. More details below in the Overflow Multiplier Table.

# To participate in the IFO:

Refer to the [**IFO participation guide**](https://bit.ly/3CnhH6p) and [**iCAKE article**](https://bit.ly/3R0xNHj).

iCAKE and locked CAKE cannot be used to buy tokens in the IFO, so you would need a separate amount of CAKE to commit to the IFO.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Private Sale ($300,000, 25% of Sale allocation)

For the Private Sale, participants are required to own a [**Pancake Squad NFT**](https://bit.ly/3wkBzTM), and [**set them as your Pancake Profile avatar**](https://bit.ly/3AfqnsN). 

For this Private Sale, the maximum amount of funds that can be committed per user is **$1000**.

The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session.

#### Public Sale ($900,000, 75% of Sale Allocation)

As the name suggests, the Public Sale is open to all. However, this comes with a participation fee, which will be fully burned!

# The WMX Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn WMX!

- **Total Tokens:** 1,000,000 WMX
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends
- **Finish time:** Approx. 60 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.5787 WMX


#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 5 days, then unlimited CAKE staking thereafter – the cap will enable everyone to enjoy pool rewards at a high APY.

**For the first 5 days, you need an active PancakeSwap Profile in order to stake in the IFO Syrup Pool. No PancakeSwap Profile requirement thereafter.**

# The WMX Farm:

We will host a **WMX-BUSD farm** that will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first week and thereafter, 0.5x CAKE rewards.

At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1400 UTC on 12 Dec 2022 – the farm will have its rewards adjusted to 0.1x unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.5x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues etc.

690,"**Summary:**

A proposal by the Mechanism.Capital 13 team to create a Curve Metapool for Empty Set Dollar (ESD) and the 3Pool stablecoins (USDC, USDT, and DAI).

ESD has been one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins launched to date. Its market capitalization has grown to over $65 million in the ~2 months since its inception (peaked near $100 million).

The unique mechanism design of the protocol makes it a strong candidate to become one of the largest stable collateral assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

Creating an ESD metapool would attract more liquidity to the Curve platform and lead to increased trading fees.

Learn more about metapools here: https://resources.curve.fi/faq/base-and-metapools 1

**Abstract:**

Empty Set Dollar (ESD) is a new algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin that utilizes fixed protocol rules on supply expansion as well as a unique coupon creation + redemption model to incentivize trustless coordination between selfish participants that maintain ESD’s synthetic peg 1:1 with the US dollar all on-chain. Unlike other algorithmic stable coins like AMPL, ESD does not rebase all balances using non-standard functions, but instead adjusts supply through other mechanisms, allowing ESD to have the same composability as other standard ERC20 tokens.

Currently, crypto lacks a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoin. While DAI and sUSD come close, they currently have vulnerabilities in their architecture. The goal of ESD is to create a truly permissionless, scaleable, stable store of value, that can be used as superfluid collateral in DeFi.

Note: ESD currently only incentivizes the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool. In order to motivate more liquidity to flow to this Curve metapool, ESD holders would have to vote to upgrade ESD to incentivize this new pool. However, various ESD community members have already expressed their support for such a prospective proposal to reward Curve LPs.

*Liquidity:*

Total Uniswap Liquidity as of 11/3/2020: $1.52 million

Avg. Daily Trading Volume (Last 14 Days ended 11/3/2020): $3.75 million

*Token Holder Distribution:*

As of 11/4/2020 there are currently over 853 unique addresses holding ESD. This includes 668 staked addresses.

Over 90% of ESD tokens were staked to the DAO as of 11/3/2020.

**Motivation:**

This is an opportunity for Curve to attract more liquidity to its platform and increase trading fees. It would also benefit the ESD community by increasing the efficiency of ESD turnover and accelerating ESD contraction & expansion cycles to further stabilize the price of the token around $1. Finally, accelerating the growth of ESD would enhance the antifragility of the entire DeFi ecosystem due to ESD’s unique characteristics relative to other stable assets.

**Specification:**

This metapool would include ESD, USDC, USDT, and DAI. It is likely that the ESD protocol community would vote to incentivize this Curve metapool. It already does this for the ESD/USDC pool on Uniswap: https://emptyset.finance/#/pool/

**For:**

This pool would bring more liquidity and fees to the Curve protocol.

It would also help accelerate and dampen the volatility ESD’s expansion/contraction cycles, which are currently delayed due to the limitations of slippage on the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool.

Successful passage of this proposal would show the Curve community’s willingness to support new, innovative protocols – specifically those focused on open and permissionless access to DeFi.

**Against:**

ESD is a relatively new and experimental protocol. There are both known and unknown risks to explore as the protocol matures. These include, but are not limited to:

ESD is expected to trade within a narrow band around US$1.00, but has experienced short periods of significant volatility

A downward spiral in the instance of zero demand for new coupons (though in the current contraction period, over 26m coupons have been purchased)

Smart contract bugs (code is currently under audit); and

A design flaw that leads to an economic attack (see the recent Harvest Finance attack 1).

CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from **Juggernaut ($JGN)**, a Metaverse NFT 2.0 project with a powerful DeFi Infrastructure, creating a cohesive and empowering ecosystem.

#### What is Boost?

Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, the JGN-BNB farm will go to a 0.5x multiple for 7 days. Don’t worry, this will only cause temporary dilution among the other farms. At the same time, there will be a new $JGN Syrup Pool with 125,000 JGN tokens to be earned by staking CAKE.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $JGN tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 105,500 JGN
- **Distribution duration:** 7 days
- **Start time:** Approx. 11am UTC on November 11th 2021
- **Finish time:** Approx. 11am UTC on November 18th 2021
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.5233 JGN
    
#### Max Stake per wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterward.

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some Syrup pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.

#### What is Juggernaut?

From the team: “Juggernaut (JGN) is leading the way to Metaverse NFT 2.0 with a powerful DeFi Infrastructure. JGN wants to achieve a cohesive intersection of DeFi, NFTs, and Metaverse, into a fun and consumer-grade experience.

The JGN ecosystem features a BSC NFT Exchange, JuggerWORLD, which is a globally leading and interconnected NFT exchange including user minting, royalty distribution. Moreover, DeFi infrastructure with governance, voting and unique membership benefits enable a more empowered user experience.

However over the past several months has only resulted in those projects getting less liquidity...and ultimately fizzling out of defi. 
This hurts PCS. This hurts defi.

A DEX needs liquidity. More emphasis needs to be placed on this. People don't understand that you make money even when there are NO Cake rewards. And PCS does not educate people in that regard.

However deincentivizing pools that have taken the time to be a part of the PCS ecosystem isn't the solution. 

As I've mentioned in a previous proposal...the only solution to keeping CAKE emissions as they are, yet still incentivizing more liquidity and pools is to create a token specifically for farming. One that is designed for the future. The current CAKE tokenomics does not support more liquidity. There is less than 0.5% of BTC on PCS...which speaks to how much growth potential there is...but if the BTC/BNB pool were to get 10X more liquidity the APR would be 0.9% at current prices. Taking what little CAKE reards from smaller projects to keep supporting the main pool s does not support innovation and long-term growth. 

Create a new token that requires you to
1. Hold a minimum amount of CAKE
2. Supports 10X liquidity growth while still giving compettive rewards
3. Support higher APR in ALL pools including the longterm pool

title: ARC: Extend the Safety Module Protection to Aave V2 Avalanche
status: WIP
author: Governance House, @MatthewGraham @ncitron, 3SE Holding & uhom 
created: 25/07/2022

---

# Simple Summary

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module (SM) protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested.

# Abstract

The Safety Module is a $700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users. It’s a unique mechanism within DeFi, that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users. At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market. As a result, not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection.

As new markets hold more risk at launch, they are initially excluded from the SM protection. Today, most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO, they seem fit for SM protection.

# Motivation

The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi. This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market. As new markets hold additional risk, these are not initially protected by the SM. However, once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months, the risks are significantly lower. Furthermore, the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process, with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2.

Overall, these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market, holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market. This implies that, in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market, the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market. Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks, as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers.

Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers (lps) on these markets. By reducing the risk for lps, it is expected to lead to further growth of the market’s TVL overtime. Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets, lps are treated more equally across the markets.

The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets. In the case of Aave markets on other chains, the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure, and not failures caused by the chains themselves (Polygon/Avax). With regards to the Aave Arc Market, Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAO’s stated risk parameters, should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update, the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance.

These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem. In particular, the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive. Today, most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon, while just about 100k on Ethereum V2. These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections, in a shorter time period.

# Specification

The table below shows the Aave V2 markets, assets listed and ecosystem collections for the Aave DAO.

### **Introduction/Abstract**

This proposal aims to bring the Snapshot strategy in line with the original expectations for space based snapshot delegation, by simply using the raw vlAURA balance instead of the voting power, which is delegated on-chain with the vlAURA contract. 

In plain English, it proposes using only one layer of delegation rather than two.

### **Motivation**

There are several reasons to make this change:

- It is simpler to measure voting power with one delegation rather than two layers
- vlAURA holders may choose to delegate to Balancer delegates rather than Aura delegates for Balancer proposals
- Many vlAURA holders are delegating with voting marketplaces such as Hidden Hand and may wish to override their vote on Balancer proposals

### **Risks**

This is a relatively minor adjustment to the Snapshot Space as vlAURA-veBAL is already supported, and the calculation for the underlying veBAL remains the same. The new strategy has been tested thoroughly. 

### **Specification**

**Current strategy**

The current Balancer voting strategy uses three sub-strategies:

1. veBAL balance (`erc20-balance-of`)
2. A delegation strategy (`delegation`) for the `balancer.eth` space using veBAL balance (`erc20-balance-of`) and vlAURA votes mapped to the underlying veBAL balance (`aura-vlaura-vebal`)
3. vlAURA votes mapped to the underlying veBAL balance (`aura-vlaura-vebal`)

In this strategy, vlAURA holders delegate their AURA through Aura's delegation system (i.e. not the Balancer delegation space), and cannot override the vote of their delegate. Given many vlAURA holders delegate with voting marketplaces like Hidden Hand, this is sub-optimal and complicated, since it involves two layers of delegation.

**Proposed strategy**

Change the vlAURA parts of the strategy to use a new strategy (`aura-balance-of-vlaura-vebal`) that maps the vlAURA balance (not delegated votes) to the underlying veBAL balance.

In this strategy, vlAURA holders can choose to delegate their vote via the Balancer delegation space. The vlAURA vote delegation does not affect voting power. Similarly to holding and delegating veBAL in this strategy, vlAURA holders can choose to override the vote of their delegate for a given proposal.

708,"### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/286)

**Summary**

Proposal to add gauge support for uniETH-wETH composable stable pool with a 2% emissions cap.

uniETH is an institutional friendly liquid staking token that represents ETH staked in Bedrock plus all future rewards from staking. There is more than USD3.7mil ETH staked at the time of writing.

**Protocol Description**

Bedrock's native tokenized version of staked Ether is known as uniETH.

uniETH represents the staked ETH in Bedrock plus all future staking rewards. uniETH is non-rebasing, i.e. does not grow in quantity over time but grows in value instead. In other words, 1 uniETH will be worth more than 1 ETH as time goes on, and its value will continue to increase as more time passes. uniETH’s non-rebasing model allows users to hold uniETH on centralized exchanges and use it in decentralized financial applications seamlessly.

Launched by RockX, Bedrock is a non-custodial solution that satisfies the requirements of institutions seeking a basis for large-scale liquid staking. By bringing new levels of transparency and security to liquid staking, Bedrock allows institutions to unlock liquidity safely by adhering to regulations while leveraging a true crypto-native solution.

**Motivation**

Balancer’s ability to increase capital efficiency using composable pools is taking shape across the industry. The uniETH-wETH pool fits Balancer’s initiative to be a protocol where Liquidity Pools can safely tap into external yield sources while maintaining effective liquidity for swapping:

* uniETH-wETH pool will earn yield for both liquidity providers and Balancer
* uniETH-wETH pool also provides Bedrock with a place for its tokens to be swapped and deposited easily as the pool increases in TVL

**Specifications**

**Governance**: The BedrockDAO is slated to launch in the coming months with a DAO token that utilizes the vote escrow model for its token holders to participate in protocol governance and more. An update regarding the DAO token can be found [here](https://medium.com/@bedrock_dao/bedrock-1-month-update-whats-next-spoiler-airdrop-e8872425d23d) 

**Oracles**: This pool relies on on-chain data calculations, and not on rate providers, to determine uniETH’s balance and estimated rewards.

**Audits**: See uniETH’s smart contract audit by Peckshield [here](https://github.com/RockX-SG/stake/blob/main/PeckShield-Audit-Report-RockXStaking-v1.0.pdf).

**Centralization Vectors**: See the architecture of uniETH [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RockX-SG/stake/main/doc/uniETH_ETH2_0_Liquid_Staking_Explained.pdf). All treasury contracts and protocol upgrades have multi-signature wallets in place.

STAKING_ADDRESS: '0x4beFa2aA9c305238AA3E0b5D17eB20C045269E9d'

The manager role to withdraw manager’s rewards: ‘0x4beFa2aA9c305238AA3E0b5D17eB20C045269E9d’

**Market History**: The uniETH token and Bedrock product only went live after our team was able to rigorously test the functionality of staking and unstaking ETH on-chain after the Shapella upgrade. Since its launch, uniETH has been one of the fastest growing liquid staking tokens with more than 2176 ETH (> USD3.7mil) staked on Bedrock.

**Value:** uniETH is poised to drive great value to the Balancer ecosystem because Balancer will serve as the main liquidity provider for the uniETH-wETH swap pair. Balancer provides uniETH holders the option to swap their uniETH for wETH immediately and in amounts of less than 32 ETH, as opposed to observing a 2-10 day unstaking period if executed through the Bedrock product.

Bedrock’s uniETH follows AML protocols with KYC/KYB checks required for users who intend to mint more than 32 ETH equivalent of uniETH.

* With this built-in AML capability, uniETH expects to see an influx of institutional funds
* This will increase the demand for immediate uniETH liquidity on Balancer.

As a result, liquidity providers will earn the protocol fee on underlying uniETH as well as swap fees.

In addition, liquidity providers may be entitled to the upcoming Bedrock DAO token airdrop and have access to all its corresponding utilities.

714,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Hashflow ($HFT) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Hashflow! 

Hashflow is a decentralized exchange designed for interoperability, zero slippage, and Maximal extractable value (MEV)-protected trades. It allows you to trade any asset on any chain in seconds simply by connecting your wallet.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn HFT tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 182,000 HFT
 - **Distribution duration:** 10 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 5 Dec 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 15 Dec 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.6319 HFT

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the HFT Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing an HFT-BUSD farm.  


The farm will have 0.1x CAKE rewards. At the end of the 10-day period – approx. 1200 UTC on 15 Dec 2022 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.1x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $HFT?

From the team: “The use cases of HFT are as follows:

- **Governance:** Voting rights are determined based on the amount of HFT staked as well as the duration for which HFT is locked
- **In-DAO Health & Rewards:** Staked tokens will be used to determine users’ health metrics within the Hashverse. Users must continuously adjust the amount and duration of their staked tokens in order to maintain their health within the Hashverse”

717,"# June 2022 CAKE Emission Reduction

It has been a while since we did the last CAKE emission reduction, but we know it’s one of the most discussed topics in the community. As our goal is still for CAKE to become emission neutral or even deflationary, we wish to continue the conversation with our community, and hear your thoughts.

## Read before voting

Before you vote, please make sure you understand the impact of long and short term effects of CAKE emissions changes on our tokenomics.

- Read and digest the [**CAKE Tokenomics documentation**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics) 
- Read this proposal in full;
- Make up your mind, and cast your vote!
    

#### Why reduce emission?

The end goal of reducing emissions is to make CAKE “emission neutral” or “deflationary”. That means, on average, the amount of CAKE burnt per block will be more than the amount of CAKE minted.

#### What are the downsides?

Reducing CAKE that is distributed to farms has negative effects, and the proposal options we are providing take this into consideration.

If we were to burn 1 additional CAKE per block, **our CAKE-BNB APR may drop by roughly 12%.** This is likely to have a negative impact on liquidity for our platform, and also affects the many projects we support here on PancakeSwap.

This is why, to keep our farms at a healthy APR, and to encourage liquidity on our platform, we are proposing the following options: **no change, 0.25 CAKE per block reduction, and 0.50 CAKE per block reduction**. 

To give you a better idea of the effect of reduced CAKE emissions on farm APR, consider the following examples to see how the proposed reductions might affect the APR:

| Total Emission Reduction Per Block    | No change | -0.25 | -0.50 |
|:-- |:---: |:---:|:---:|
| CAKE Allocated to Farms & Lottery Per Block| 4.25 | 4.00 | 3.75 | 
| CAKE Emissions Per Block | 14.25 | 14.00 | 13.75 |
| Est. CAKE-BNB APR (40x Multiplier) | 30%     | 28%    | 25%    | 



Many projects’ farms with lower multipliers will also have their APRs reduced.

#### But we need to become deflationary! Inflation is too high already!!!
We agree. It’s absolutely still the goal to keep CAKE “emission neutral” or “deflationary”. 
That said, given the current state of the market, it might be time to ease up on the aggressive emission reduction… for now. There’s a fine line between supply reduction, and damaging the farm APR.

So, to make sure we keep supply low, we’re constantly working on more ideas that will instead contribute to bigger and bigger weekly CAKE burns. Stay tuned!

#### What's the current supply?

So far, effective CAKE emission per block has already dropped from 40 CAKE / block to only 14.25 CAKE / block.

We also burn CAKE from an increasing number of sources every week, such as our trading fees. Check out the list here:

**https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics#other-deflationary-mechanics**

After these burns, our net CAKE emission per block has been ~ 11 CAKE / block for the past few months.

You can view our current supply on tracking sites, such as [**CoinGecko**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pancakeswap), [**CoinMarketCap**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/), or check out our [**Supply API**](https://api.pancakeswap.com/api/supply).

CAKE holders can vote for any one of these options at the bottom of this page.

### ❌ No change:

- 4.25 CAKE per block go to Farms
- Total emissions: 14.25 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pools)

718,"#### Proposal to Reduce CAKE Token Total Supply

Over the past year, PancakeSwap has significantly revamped its tokenomics, emissions, and growth strategy. Starting from improving [**CAKE Tokenomics v2.5**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x707643dd2c2b941c7274f26a0362922198912e8549050ae9f2d1d9d71ada04bb) to most recently launching the [**veCAKE Gauges System**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), CAKE is in a position to pursue further growth across all deployments.

Now that CAKE has achieved consistent deflation for several months and is focusing on accelerating our journey to ultrasound CAKE, this proposal aims to reduce the CAKE token’s total supply to a **maximum cap of 450M CAKE**. 

With a current **total supply of 388M CAKE**, the Kitchen believes this new and lower cap will be sufficient to gain market share across all chains and sustain the veCAKE model.

![](https://imgur.com/kGk5kri.png)


#### Proposal Rationale:
There are several strong reasons to implement this adjustment:
- **Certainty for the community on future CAKE token supply**: 

When PancakeSwap launched in 2021, to ensure that there were sufficient incentives to bootstrap the ecosystem, there was significant token inflation. After almost 3 years in development, we now have more accurate estimations of incentives required to achieve our growth targets.

- **Accelerate the journey to ultrasound CAKE**: 

Total supply is an important metric when understanding the impact of token burns and future emissions. Lowering this number is a critical step to achieve ultrasound CAKE and enables us to send a clear signal of PancakeSwap’s pivot away from a hyperinflationary tokenomics model.

- **Ensure sufficient flexibility for growth**: 

450M CAKE is a reasonable new cap as it  ensures sufficient supply for future growth (e.g., gaining market share on Ethereum, Ethereum L2s, and new initiatives like position managers)


#### Adjustment Details:
With the above in mind, we propose the following adjustments to CAKE total supply:
- **Current Total Supply:** 750,000,000 CAKE
- **Future Total Supply:** 450,000,000 CAKE
- **CAKE Total Supply Decrease:** -300,000,000 CAKE
- **Implementation steps:** Decrease the max cap on token supply accordingly

Title: [ARFC] Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum
Date: 2024-05-13
Author: Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)
---

## Summary

The proposal aims to onboard Threshold Network’s tBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum. tBTC is backed one-to-one with Bitcoin.

## Motivation/Background:

tBTC is Threshold’s decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum’s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.

Having recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).

tBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.

Threshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.

### Benefits for Aave:

- Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.
- A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.
- Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.
- Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.
- Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium’s LTIPP.

### Emission schedule

tBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.

### Risks

For tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - [Wallet Generation  Threshold Docs](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation)

The Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:

724,"Gauge Proposal Template:

**Summary:**
> This pool uses the new weighted pool factory which allows Balancer to apply the protocol fee to rETH's yield. This gauge would be introduced as a ""core pool"" under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. In addition, any RPL collected by the `ProtocolFeeCollector` would also be directed towards bribing on this pool. We currently have ~$60k RPL in the fee collector which Balancer can use to bootstrap initial TVL, thus kick starting the flywheel here. It is also likely that Rocket Pool will assist with some incentives on their side. This gauge is enterring without a cap.

**References/Useful links:**

    • [Website](https://rocketpool.net/)
    • [Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/)
    • [Github Page](https://docs.rocketpool.net/developers/usage/contracts/contracts.html#introduction)    
    • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool)

**Protocol Description:**

> rETH represents liquid staked ETH. RPL is the governance token for Rocket Pool. 

**Motivation:**

> Balancer's near term focus is increasing TVL of yield bearing assets like RPL. With the new weighted pool factory we have the opportunity to also stimulate more trading activity in these yield bearing tokens. Given Rocket Pool has begun heavily bribing for rETH pools and Balancer aims to support the expansion of rETH, it is natural that we should attempt to secure more trading of RPL. Currently we will only be competing with uni-v3 so I expect interest and uptake to be strong here.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Please see this [guide](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1) which outlines Rocket Pool's DAO structure. 

2. **Oracles:** This pool will rely on a rate provider which has been in use for the rETH/ETH pool for some time. You can see it [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a8F81c256aee9C640e14bB0453ce247ea0DFE6F). 

3. **Audits:** See [here](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-4-2635c44e4f7e).

4. **Centralization vectors:** Rocket Pool is a [protocol for decentralized and trustless ETH2 staking](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd).

5. **Market History:** See [coingecko page](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth).
 
6. **Value:** Balancer will soon be the top destination for rETH liquidity on Ethereum if we aren't already. In order to boost our protocol revenue from this liquidity we need to stimulate rETH trading activity. RPL being the governance token of rETH seems a natural first step for a non-correlated pairing. RPL has seen significant trading interest going into the merge and this would be the first incentivized RPL liquidity pool on Ethereum as far as I know.

725,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-treasury-swap-balancer-dao-fei-dao/2254).

Hi - Brianna here, core contributor at Fei Protocol. Fei has created a stablecoin that stabilizes itself through transparent on-chain reserves.

We recently announced [Fei v2](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/introducing-fei-v2-6f56afe7a1b5), introducing a way to algorithmically manage volatility risk through a custom Investment Pool using Balancer v2 platform. This has the potential to add Fei’s current PCV (currently $913M +) to the Balancer platform. Tribe Community is excited to team up with Balancer!

As Fei v2 implementation anticipates bringing significant TVL to Balancer, it would be beneficial for our communities to further our alignment through a Treasury swap.

Inspiration for this proposal came from our mutual friends at [Index Coop](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-treasury-swap-balancer-indexed/2188).

Benefits include:

-Treasury diversification into two assets (FEI, a stable asset, and TRIBE, with 
 governance rights and Protocol Controlled Value performance upside)
     -Balancer DAO is eligible to earn additional TRIBE by participating in Fei’s 
       incentivized staking programs (Uni v2, Rari, Curve, etc.)
-FEI would give Balancer stable assets in its Treasury
-Distributes tokens into the hands of a long-term ecosystem partner
-Governance power for DAO proposals

## Specification

200,000 BAL from the Ecosystem Fund would be exchanged for the equivalent USD value of TRIBE and FEI in equal proportions from Fei DAO Treasury, using the 20 day smooth moving average price at the time that voting ends. Currently 1 BAL = 22.49 FEI = 34.33 TRIBE. Price feed will be BAL/USDT (Binance) and TRIBE/FEI (Uni-V2) FEI/ETH (Uni-V2)

Fei DAO will deposit BAL into BAL/WETH 80/20 paired with ETH from the PCV and commits to holding for the long run. The Fei DAO will also be eligible to earn BAL rewards, which will be further held by Fei and possibly reinvested in the 80/20 BAL/WETH pool.

Balancer commits to holding TRIBE for the long run and using FEI for operations.",neutral

title: [ARFC] Polygon v3 Supply Cap Update 2023.05.21
shortDescription: Increase SupplyCap stMATIC on Polygon v3 from 30M units to 40M units.
author: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic
dated: 2023-05-21

---

# Summary

This publication proposes increasing the stMATIC Supply Cap on Polygon from 30.0M to 40M units.

# Abstract

This AIP implements risk parameter changes to stMATIC Polgyon v3.

The utilisation of the stMATIC reserve has reached 99.95% and this publication proposes increasing the SupplyCap by a further 33.33% to 40M units.

# Motivation

Over the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. These products are now active with otheres through audit and soon to be deployed. 

With conservative Supply Caps being implemented and filled within minutes, or hours, communities who have built products on Aave v3 are experiencing great frustration. After investing time, resources and incurring audit costs, these communities are unable to promote their products to prospective users prior the newly implemented Supply Caps being filled. Some communities have coordinated large distribution network agreements in anticipation of offering users yield derived from Aave v3.

For these integrations to be successful, the Supply Caps need to be increased such that a wide array of prospective users can enter into these automated strategies. Currently, the Supply Caps are filling so fast Aave DAO can not even proactively implement upgrades through governance to maintain spare deposit capacity. At the root of the issue are the small incremental Supply Cap increases, these are being filled within minutes, or hours (34 hours previous stMATIC increase). These small windows of time, where users can deposits LSTs into Aave Protocol, are not conducive to creating an environment that encourages teams to build on Aave. 

The previous stMATIC Supply Cap increase was 5M units and the cap was filled within 34 hours. Other cap increases have been filled in as little as 3 minutes ([wstETH on Arbitrum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-polygon-arbitrum-v3-supply-cap-update-19-05-2023/13133)). The growth in TVL and the resulting revenue is good for Aave DAO. However, the risk exposure must be considered and it is the authors opinion that Aave DAO should consider implementing a larger increase this time. The last two stMATIC Supply Cap increases have not led to meaningful stable coin debt which is the primary risk concern.

 ![Screenshot 2023-06-04 at 22.33.58.png](ipfs://bafkreieuzgowbpk765f6hzkipfzpnvuqpmr4xsovfgnruuklp6chaazeje)
  
Something the DAO should also consider is that teams are distributing assets on Aave v3 Polygon to promote users entering the yield maximising strategy. It has led to Aave v3's TVL overtaking v2 on Polygon and increased LST adoption. If Aave DAO seeks to encourage teams to continual distribute rewards on Aave v3, then creating a supportive environment through larger Supply Cap increases is something that should be considered.

This publications seeks to increase the Supply Cap of stMATIC by 33.3%, or 10M units. This is twice the previous increase and represents 72.5% of the supply on Polygon and 33.4% of the total supply on Ethereum. This represents a pivot from the more conservative approach to risk and it recognises that liquidators could migrate stMATIC, or wMATIC, to Ethereum and redeem it for MATIC before swapping to stable coins. This type of liquidation is not atomic, nor quick and it requires the liquidator to take on price exposure over the duration of the process. However, it is wMATIC to stable coin liquidity on Polygon that is the limiting factor as stMATIC to wMATIC swaps incur low price impact on Polygon.

The author welcomes input from risk providers and feedback from the community towards the potential to implement a larger Supply Cap increase that pushes towards the 75% maximum, acknowledging there are some stable coin debt positions. If the community prefers for a more conservative 5M unit increase, same as previous proposal, the author will not hesitate to implement this whilst the discussion is ongoing.

728,"Summary:

dForce proposes to add a dToken pool (dUSDx/dDAI/dUSDC/dUSDT). dToken is a yield aggregator launched by dForce, featured by harvesting the highest underlying yield in the market (USDT 12.1% APY, USDC 6.1% APY, DAI 12.1% APY, as of 31 Aug), as well as gas optimization through a set of strategies that is anticipated to save at least 60% of gas consumption associated (compared to direct interactions with underlying lending protocol for asset supply and sale of governance token mined).
Currently, dToken pool participants can farm DF token by staking through dForce Staking Portal (https://staking.dforce.network/) (mining APY 109% for USDx/USDC on Uniswap), by adding a dToken pool on Curve, LPs could provide liquidity and have the benefit of mining both DF and CRV, (i.e with projected combined yield of 170%), which is a great additional yield incentive to LPs on Curve.

Reduce Borrow Caps for long-tailed assets on Aave V3 Ethereum.

# Motivation

As part of our [ongoing](https://governance.aave.com/t/generalized-lt-ltv-reduction-on-aave/16766) strategy to minimize theoretical exposure to long-tailed debt on Aave, this proposal aims to mitigate the impact of volatility in debt assets further by implementing a substantial reduction in Borrow Cap values. Borrowing these assets typically yields minimal revenue but can pose significant risks, particularly in scenarios where liquidating these positions necessitates obtaining the underlying asset during a large pump. Given the recent upward volatility in asset prices, we propose a refined methodology for determining and implementing these Borrow Cap reductions. This approach aims to enhance the protocol's resilience and stability amidst dynamic market conditions, safeguarding the interests of Aave users and stakeholders.

# Methodology

For methodology, please refer to the forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-borrow-cap-reductions-on-aave-ethereum-03-11-24/16918)

Gauntlet proposes adjusting interest rate parameters for the Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism Aave V3 markets. Tokens impacted include USDC, USDT, EURS, WBTC, DPI, and CRV. If these changes are approved, our models indicate that it could lead to over $135k in annualized protocol revenue growth. Forum post can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-interest-rate-curve-recommendations-from-gauntlet-2023-04-27/12921).

# Abstract
Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet’s platform has evaluated all assets on Aave V3’s active markets and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. Our methodology makes data-informed decisions around setting borrower and supplier interest rates when market conditions require the protocol to reduce risk or when strategic opportunities present themselves to increase protocol revenue without materially impacting risk. This analysis further finetunes the interest rate curves of Aave V3 across the Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism markets.

## Objectives
Among other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve:

1. **mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool**
2. **build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future**

As a secondary objective, we want to **optimize the user experience of Aave's borrowers and suppliers**.

734,"**Summary:**
FIAT DAO is seeking the preliminary approval of veBAL gauges for two yet-to-be-deployed stableswap pools.

- **FIAT-USDC-DAI**
- **FIAT-FEI-FRAX**

This comes after the successful migration of our governance token $FDT’s liquidity to the Balancer platform over the past month.

**References/Useful links:**

- **[App](https://app.fiatdao.com)**
- **[Docs](https://docs.fiatdao.com)**
- **[Dune](https://dune.com/1ab/FIAT)**
- **[Github](https://github.com/fiatdao)**
- **[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/fiatdao)**

**Protocol Description:**
The FIAT protocol is a DeFi-native repo market solution for providing liquidity to holders of fixed income assets. It allows users of apps like Element Finance, Notional Finance, and Yield Protocol to bring their proofs of liquidity to the protocol in order to collateralize a debt position in $FIAT, a stable value asset. Our v1 has just launched, and it’ll look and feel familiar for users who have previously minted DAI, RAI, or MIM. By utilizing proven stablecoin mechanisms, the protocol is able to offer competitive borrowing power to holders of such collateral assets, allowing them to releverage fixed yields or meet current liabilities as the locked assets mature. You can learn more about its primary use case via [this thread](https://twitter.com/wjvill/status/1527680960866705408) from Element founder Will Villanueva.

**The success of FIAT is predicated on its ability to attract secondary liquidity.** In its current iteration, it is pooling secondary liquidity around a singular asset, drawing forward demand for an otherwise fragmented universe of collateral backing. Unique to FIAT versus other CDP implementations is that fixed term collateral forces users to repay back their debt at a known point in time, lest they bear negative yields due to FIAT interest accrual on those positions thereafter - this allows for higher maximum LTVs and potentially more trading fees for LPs. Currently, only stablecoin-denominated collateral is supported by the protocol, so any risk premium is a function of smart contract concerns or changes in prevailing yields.

**Motivation:**
Over the course of its first month in existence, $FIAT has had its liquidity subsidized on Curve via a discretionary budget. Over the same time, liquidity for our governance token has been ported to Balancer. We’ve been very pleased with the migration and think it makes sense to follow suit with $FIAT here in its early days.

A number of items excite us about the opportunity:

- The presence of boosted staBAL and now FEI-FRAX-DAI pools will allow for user pathways that involve depositing into either, minting FIAT, and selling FIAT for more of the underlying in order to gain levered fixed exposure. **This results in locked TVL for Balancer and higher trading fees for Balancer LPs.**

- With Hidden Hand, it will become possible to have a larger consortium of projects actively subsidize FIAT LPs. We anticipate that all of our collateral partners with associated ERC-20 tokens will see the value in deeper FIAT liquidity for their protocols. And for other stableswap pools that exist on Balancer, deeper FIAT liquidity increases the odds of locked TVL in their pools.

- The user experience associated with veBAL and Hidden Hand is more clear than our current Curve → Rari Fuse flow.

**What we would like to discuss in this thread, however, is the deployment of the stableswap pools themselves.** Given the nature of FIAT (i.e. CDP architecture, stablecoin backing, audited collateral issuers), we would be interested to hear what members of the Balancer DAO have to say regarding their comfort with varying levels of potential [A coefficients](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/math/stable-math). If you have any specific thoughts regarding this topic, please share your opinion in the thread!

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** FIAT DAO is a completely on-chain organization, with no corresponding real world entity in place. The FDT token has been given away for free since November of 2021, and a DAO smart contract architecture has been live since December 2021.

2. **Oracles:** $FDT is a standard ERC-20 DeFi governance token that comes with the volatility inherent to the sector. $FIAT is a DAI-like asset that will come to be backed by less liquid derivatives, but at the moment only supports collateral types with existing secondary markets.

3. **Audits:** Audits of our protocol and our collateral oracle system can be found in the [Security](https://github.com/fiatdao/security) repo within our Github.

4. **Centralization Vectors:** $FDT holders determine which assets are supported as collateral and the parameters associated with each. A six of eleven guardian multisig currently holds certain emergency privileges.

5. **Market History:** $FIAT has been transferable since April 2022. It previously reached a high watermark of $1.3M deposited on Curve.

We would like to take this to a vote now that the FUD pool is live.

Title: [ARFC] Updated Aave Grants Continuation Proposal 
Author: @0xmigi & Bill
Created: 2023-11-14

---

# Summary

An opportunity to continue Aave Grants DAO (AGD) for 6 months by preserving the current AGD treasury holdings and increasing AGD’s GHO allowance by $328,000.

This proposal will enable AGD to deliver and improve upon the top tier grants program the Aave ecosystem has had over the past 2+ years and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem. AGD will fund $500,000 in developer grants per quarter, drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption, and set the groundwork for the next chapter of the continued evolution of AGD.

Figures and calculations based on asset prices have been updated from the TEMP CHECK to reflect the current market conditions.

# Motivation

Throughout the previous proposal, AGD has:

Awarded 50 new grants and made 15 payments to grantees based on milestone completion.

Engaged builders and the community at five events, including four hackathons where AGD awarded a total of 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties and inspired 58 teams to hack with Aave and GHO.

Proliferated the ghost by hosting 1 rAAVE to strengthen Aave’s culture, bring the community together, and cultivate an ecosystem with the best contributors.

Exercised prudence with the treasury by decreasing the average grant size awarded by 52.8% and maintaining average reviewer compensation at ~22% of the monthly maximum budget.

This proposal outlines renewing AGD for the next 6 months by:

Increasing AGD’s GHO allowance by $328,000.

# Specification

Since its inception in May 2021 to September 2023, AGD has awarded $4,852,753 across 249 grants.

From the last AGD proposal in January 2023 to now, AGD has awarded 50 grants and awarded 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties across four different hackathons.

*Note: All $ cost amounts are calculated at time of payment, pre/post token value fluctuations are not included unless otherwise specified. Pending payments are not included.

This is the fifth proposal for AGD:

- The initial proposal launched AGD in May 2021 with $1 million of total funding over two quarters.

- The second proposal was executed at the end of December 2021 and funded AGD for three months with $2 million of funding.

- The third proposal was executed at the end of May 2022 and funded AGD for six months with $3 million per quarter.

*Since the Last Proposal*

The community has been kept up to date with AGD’s activity in @0xmigi’s monthly governance updates, the Halfway Update, and through AGD being added to Llama’s treasury dashboard 1. The AGD website houses a running list since inception of grants awarded, event and sponsorship spend and other information.

The GHO release was an exciting launch for the Aave community and was a prioritized focus throughout AGD’s last proposal. AGD began to spread awareness about GHO’s launch and encouraged early development with GHO across the four hackathons that were sponsored. AGD also funded multiple GHO related grants and supported development with the introduction of ‘Request for Grants’, inviting projects that help to stimulate GHO’s demand and increase its utility to apply for a grant.

*AGD Budget*

AGD has exercised prudence with the treasury, while continuing to fund high quality builders and drive growth and experimentation in the Aave ecosystem. The current AGD treasury, including token allowances and OP, is roughly $1,435,042. Please note: despite continuing to operate and distribute grants, the dollar value of the treasury has remained relatively flat since the TEMP CHECK due to the appreciation of AAVE and OP.

Part of the reduced spend is because of a reduction in the average size of grants awarded. The average grant size awarded so far in 2023 is 52.8% lower than the average grant size awarded during 2022, currently at $13,936.

Here is AGD’s spend over the course of the previous proposal:

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreihafvtfdgespbdluqm6uv5kj2fbitjoutolsqorktozffh4tshhta)

*Other Initiatives*

- Increasing Grantee Accountability. There has been an influx in grantees (e.g. recently Defi Simulator, Projection Finance, and Aave Alarm) posting directly on the forum to introduce themselves, explain their grant, and to keep the community updated as they progress. Most of these posts are the result of an initiative from AGD to better increase grantee accountability and engagement with the community.

- ‘Requests for Grants’ (RFGs). A pilot project has been introduced to better direct builders to apply for grants in certain high impact areas. Going forward, AGD will look to expand the list of RFGs to target high impact areas and community needs by better communicating with different contributors and encouraging anyone to make suggestions.

- AGD Operations and Best Practices. Over the last two years of operations, AGD’s values and best practices have been refined and adopted. It is a priority for AGD to clearly define and share these values and best practices with the community. Here is an overview of AGD’s current process:

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiefrkqq5lsl3na4sm7hhxnwaqozsxmhvt67edyvm6sdms3iz44pke)

*Grantee Highlights*

Since AGD’s last proposal to September 2023, 50 new grants have been awarded and 15 follow up milestone payments have been made. Of the 50 new grants awarded, 22 are complete, live or have reached notable milestones at the time of writing. Each grant has positively impacted different aspects of the Aave ecosystem.

 
![image](ipfs://bafybeic5lh6oay26aff4iuyetkhxlv6uxktk73qgcbhvbv6lhvzktvtjry)

Here are some recent highlights from grantees:

Dullahan

Designed and launched a hub for GHO to drive adoption. Dullahan produces passive income for stkAAVE holders and provides GHO borrowers with access to reduced interest rates and reached over 3,000 AAVE in deposits a few weeks after launch.

Sommelier Finance

Enables the creation of state-of-the-art DeFi strategies that leverage Aave V3 and GHO with the development and audit of a Aave V3 adaptor used by Sommelier strategies. As of July, their Aave V3 integration has allocated a net of $4M to Aave V3.

AAVE based CIAN Strategies & Automation Tools

Expands access to Aave V3 with open source vaults and advanced automation tooling, allowing strategists to generate strategies and users to easily access yield. As of August 2023, CIAN has generated $55M in TVL across Aave V2 and V3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, Ethereum Mainnet, Avalanche and Optimism via its leveraged staking strategies.

Other applications include: DeFi Simulator, Aave Alarm, Projection Finance and Karma HQ’s Delegate Dashboard.

IntoTheBlock Risk Radar for GHO 1

Helps the community understand GHO’s activity with 20 dedicated risk indicators including peg performance, collateral distribution and whale credit history.

Xenophon Labs

Performed an analysis on the Safety Module proposing an increase in the slashing percentage with the intent of saving the Aave protocol ~$2.1M per year

Butter

Facilitated an incentivized delegate initiative which kickstarted paying Aave delegates, encouraged participation in Aave governance from new community members and sparked TokenLogic to start their delegate platform.

Flexible aToken Voting ScopeLift

Unlocks the potential for new deposits by enabling protocols to allow users to retain voting power with tokens that are active in DeFi like Aave.

AwesomeQA

Streamlined the community support process with their Discord bot that automatically and quickly responds to user questions. In the past 3 months, the bot has answered over 55% of all questions, with 30% of those answers voted up by users indicating the response was very helpful.

*Operational Focuses for this Proposal*

The path to a decentralized and sustainable AGD is a long journey. Here are some initiatives planned for this proposal to continue working towards an effective and sustainable AGD:

Finish Establishing Legal Entity

Establishing a legal entity allows AGD to begin operating more independently and with more protection and certainty for contributors by providing a legal structure for members and the ability to operate with the traditional financial world. As it currently exists, AGD is not able to even sign a contract. Transitioning to an entity is a big step for AGD’s maturity by providing clarity and protection to contributors, along with increasing operational effectiveness.

AGD is currently finalizing the process of establishing a Cayman Foundation Company. The grants process will continue to operate as it does today and there will be no noticeable changes to AGD’s current processes or operations for the community.

Revamping Review Committee

AGD will update the processes and structure around the review committee. One idea AGD will explore is introducing a rotating committee of community experts to serve short (3-6 months) time frames as grant reviewers. This will further involve the community in AGD while bringing expertise from different community members.

AGD and Service Provider Alignment

With the increased number of Service Providers, there is a need to create better alignment between AGD and the work being done across the Aave DAO. Introducing simple activities like regular touch points would enable AGD to better (de)prioritize areas for grants based on feedback and insights from service providers. Where appropriate, AGD can also better work with service providers on helping to define the scope of related grants.

Measuring Impact

AGD aims to enhance the way it measures impact from grants by further developing internal resources and working with teams such as Spindl to better track the impact effectiveness of grants.

Starting with specific categories of grants like quests, AGD will better visualize activity driven by grants and gain insights into the effectiveness of different spend. Over time, AGD will extend similar tracking to other grant categories and impact metrics. This will enable the community to better track impact from grantees and empower AGD to make better review decisions.

*People*

AGD now has ten members.

Lead. Bill oversees the growth of the team, the distribution of grants, and making sure AGD meets the strategic needs of Aave DAO.

Review Committee. The Review Committee is made up of:

Corbin Page - Paymagic, ex-ConsenSys

Calvin Chu - Impossible Finance

Francis Gowen - Flipside Crypto

Lawrence Mosley - Omni Analytics

Kakashi - Symphony

Andrew Allen - Coinbase

David Truong - x23.ai, ex-Aave Companies Genesis team dev

Operations Lead. Neil has streamlined the application process, manages payments, KYC, and other administrative tasks.

Analyst. Migi is the main touch point with current and future grantees. He finds opportunities where AGD can support grantees and track the returns generated. Migi also provides monthly updates on the governance forum.

Compensation:

Lead: $9k/month

Review committee: $150/hr, capped at 10 hrs/week

Reviewer pay per month has averaged $1,273/month per reviewer since May 2021. We will look to modify this as part of the overall revamp of the review committee.
Analyst: $5k/month

Operations lead: $150/hr capped at 20 hrs/month

Designer and other roles: one-off based on specific design engagements

The roles and compensation will be reviewed and iterated on in line with the focuses outlined above.

*Proposed Budgets*

This proposal’s total budget will be split between a Grants Budget and an Operations Budget. In total across budgets the total ask for the next 6 months is:

$328,000 increase in AGD’s GHO allowance
This would make AGD’s treasury, including allowances: 72.2% in stables, 18.7% in AAVE, and 9% in OP

$292,000 that was previously allocated to ‘Digital Marketing’ spend has been reallocated to this budget.

Notably for the stablecoin portion of the treasury, AGD has started to explore further driving GHO adoption and grantee alignment by collaborating with @TokenLogic to swap AGD’s DAI allowance with GHO. AGD will look to continue to do this with other stablecoin holdings in the future based on similar style governance proposals.

*Grants Budget*

736,"title: [ARFC] Add USDT to Ethereum V3 Market

Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative, @Llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham DeFi_Consulting

Dated: 2023-01-31

Simple Summary
This proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard USDT to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

Abstract
USDT is a centralized stablecoin minted by Tether. for each unit of USDT in circulation; Tether holds a dollar or equivalent in short-term bonds or commercial paper.

This ARC is a joint effort with @Llamaxyz to allow a selection of assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Both Llama & ACI will propose AIPs on onboard assets on V3

USDT is currently one of the largest V2 stablecoin reserve with ~335m$ supplied

Motivation
Supporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.

The ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Tether or any entity to present this ARC.

The risk parameters provided introduce USDT as a non-collateral asset.

The Interest rate Strategy curve is the same as for USDT in V2. for now.
The ACI is supportive of onboarding USDT as it was in V2.
For now, the ACI doesn’t consider V3 mature enough to activate a USD stablecoins emode and consider USDT in it.
Also, supply and borrow caps are suggested for this asset to limit risk exposure.
They’re currently set to allow reserve utilization to cross the Uoptimal point slightly. But @ChaosLabs & @Pauljlei input is valuable on this.

By presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.

Specification
Ticker: USDT

Contract Address: 0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7

Risk Parameter	Value
Isolation Mode	NO
Enable Borrow	YES
Enable Collateral	NO
Loan To Value	N/A
Liquidation Threshold	N/A
Liquidation Bonus	N/A
Reserve Factor	10%

Borrow Cap	185M
Supply Cap	200M
Debt Ceiling	N/A
Base	0%
Slope1	4%
Uoptimal	90%
Slope2	72%
Additional note:
USDT has been excluded from collateral assets since DeFi inception due to its centralized nature. After years of functioning as intended and witnessing the growth of USDC in the DeFi ecosystem, it seems that reasons for exclusion have fewer grounds in the current DeFi ecosystem and pragmatic approach would be to onboard it in a conservative way and make risk parameters evolve based on market data.
While this ARC doesn’t present a proposal to add USDT as collateral, the ACI thinks the community should consider this as something to discuss at a later stage when V3 will have more maturity.

737,"##### ABSTRACT
This no-cost proposal provides a solution for an element of second-round voting during ApeCoin DAO Working Group elections that currently restricts voters to selecting only one candidate when multiple seats for the same positions are being filled.

To fix this, we propose changing the Snapshot Strategy to weighted voting, which enables the option to distribute voting power among each of the candidates you wish to see elected.

It is important to note that we are already using this method of voting in the first-round of Working Group elections. Furthermore, under this format should you favour our existing second-round standard of single-choice voting, you can still concentrate all of your voting power on one candidate. We’re simply offering an alternative for those who wish to have a broader influence across all positions being filled.

Examples of other DAOs that utilize options to help voters to select more than one candidate when multiple seats are being filled include Arbitrum, ENS, and Optimism.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
1. Improved Voter Representation and Accuracy: Under our current second-round voting format, election results do not accurately represent the community’s preferences when filling multiple seats for the same role. Instead, they reflect the community’s favourite, accounting for only one seat.

2. Stronger leadership teams: By obtaining more accurate election results, our Working Groups will be formed more deliberately, empowering the community to have a greater say in selecting the best candidates for the job.

3. Enhanced governance integrity: Elections and voting mechanics are polarizing, intricate components of any governance-operated entity. Yet, by pursuing changes in logical, fair, and meaningful ways, the sentiment within the ApeCoin DAO community toward these processes will be strengthened.

4. Preserving choice while maintaining traditional voting preferences: By shifting to a flexible voting strategy, we can provide options to voters while still maintaining the ability to select only one candidate, ensuring that members who prefer that method can still participate according to their preferences.

5. Promoting inclusivity and increasing opportunities for candidates: Weighted voting in the final round of elections will enable voters to more easily endorse multiple candidates with diverse perspectives simultaneously. This system may also amplify opportunities for qualified candidates who typically need expansive networks to obtain meaningful positions within the ApeCoin DAO Working Group structure.

##### OVERALL COST 
There is no cost to implement this proposal.

739,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allocate-bal-to-aave-weth-stakers/1909).

As part of [Aave’s Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module), an 80/20 AAVE/WETH pool was created which has since grown to be the largest pool on Balancer v1. The creation of this pool, along with the dual incentives of BAL + AAVE, established a strong partnership between Balancer and Aave. That partnership has continued with the ongoing development of the Aave Asset Manager (AM), which will be the first AM deployed on Balancer v2.

**Motivation**

Given the critical importance of the Safety Module, Aave requires additional time to migrate their pool to Balancer v2. In order to preserve the allocation of 12,500 BAL per week the pool was receiving before v2 Liquidity Mining started, we need to give Ballers the authority to allocate BAL to the 80/20 AAVE/WETH pool on v1.

**Specification**

The Ballers will initially allocate two Tier 2 slots and one Tier 3 slot for a combined 12,500 BAL per week - this will be reflected in the next weekly vote on the Baller-only snapshot. Going forward, the Ballers will have sole discretion to adjust this pool’s allocation as they see fit. The BAL allocated to this pool by the Ballers will go directly to users who have staked BPT from this pool in the Safety Module, meaning if you enter this pool and do not stake in the Safety Module you will not get BAL rewards.This pool will no longer be included in the v1 reward calculations.

Note: Aave has agreed to a three month migration deadline. BAL rewards will be provided during this time period, though not necessarily at the full 12,500 BAL per week. Ballers can choose to lower the amount if they deem it appropriate. At the end of three months, if they have not migrated to v2 then BAL rewards for their pool will end. The migration deadline will be September 20th, 2021.",bearish

This AIP aims to sponsor MOCA MONDAY Spaces and establish a rewarding vault for the community

With MOCA MONDAY we want to implement a Cross-Community focused Spaces to educate people of the Mocaverse, BAYC and Apecoin Community about general processes in the DAO, votings and explanations of AIPs.

With the raise of Mocaverse, one of the first Communities to delegate an amount of over 1.5 Million Apecoin, we think it became crucial and important to Build a Cross-Community focused Spaces where these Communities come together to learn about each others Culture and especially educate and learn about the ApecoinDAO in his mindset, the processes of participation, votings and inform about the actual AIPs and their content.

1.1 - Key Highlights

* Educate the Communities about the ApecoinDAO processes

* Weekly discussions about the content of ALL AIPs which are up for Voting

* AIP Authors and Partners live on Stage

* Learn about participation in the ApecoinDAO

* Promote important Cross-Community News & informations

* Higher participation in the ApecoinDAO, the Ape Assembly and the Mocaverse DAO

* Increase the knowledge of all Holders about BAYC, Apecoin, Yugalabs and their Ecosystem.

1.2 - Allocation

Allocation: The funds will be divided into two essential areas:

1. Community Engagement: A portion of the funds will be used to purchase exciting prizes to boost community engagement. This will help us build strong connections between the growing MOCA DAO, Apecoin DAO, and the broader community.

2. Production Enhancement: The other part of the funds will be invested in elevating the production value of these spaces. This includes improvements in editing, distribution, delegation, and marketing.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

* Reach a higher Level in understanding the processes of the ApeCoin DAO for Mocaverse Holders

* Get more educated Voters as they will be educated over every AIP upfront

* Higher the knowledge of AIP Authors how to place their AIPs in the best way in the Mocaverse Ecosystem

* Having more interested people joining the Ape Assembly

* Receiving more engaged AIP Projects which benefits the Apecoin Ecosystem

* Increase Awareness of Apecoin, the DAO, Mocaverse and other potential 3rd Party Communities which become future delegates

* Implementing a Showcase and Reference how different Communities can be integrated in a best possible way into the Story of Apecoin and BAYC to higher participation and growth

* By rewarding participation with BAYC/Mocaverse NFTs as also a crucial amount of Apecoin being rewarded to potentially and mostly new Users of the Apecoin Ecosystem

### Title: [TEMP CHECK]  Onboard Catapulta as Aave V3 Deployment Service Provider

### Author:  Kartojal & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

### Date: 2024-03-13

---

### **Summary**

The following proposal is to onboard [Catapulta](https://catapulta.sh/) as a Development Service Provider. The goal of Catapulta is to perform production and testnet Aave V3 instance deployments in EVM networks, approved by the Aave DAO.

### **Motivation**

The founder of Catapulta, David Racero, worked previously as Solidity Developer in Aave Companies during 2 years and a half, and was the main responsible for deployments scripting of Aave V2 and Aave V3 during the whole time at the company. 

Catapulta has created a smart contracts deployments platform that aims to automate certain manual workflows during deployments, like deployments reports, broadcasting txs and verifications in block explorers, allowing to speed up Web3 development cycles.

### Specification

Catapulta, as a potential Development Service Provider to the Aave DAO, will be focusing on the following scope of actions:

- Perform the deployment of new Aave V3 instances in EVM networks, in testnet and production, approved by the Aave DAO via Snapshot.
- Develop activation proposals for the Aave DAO to initialize Aave V3 instances, following all security procedures.
- Maintenance of Aave V3 deployment scripting to support new EVM networks.

The production deployment services will only happen once a positive [technical evaluation](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-deployments-technical-evaluation-framework-of-a-network/10237) AND snapshot approval from the Aave DAO.

Catapulta will reject any Aave V3 deployments requests from competitors or forks, and will pursue full transparency during the duration of the services. Catapulta will be in touch with all parties involved during the onboarding of a new Aave V3 instance, ex risk contributors, growth, development and security service providers.

### Duration & Proposed Budget

The duration for this service proposal will be 6 months.

Due the nature of the proposed services, that will only happen once a positive technical evaluation AND approval from the Aave DAO Governance, Catapulta has opted for a flat fee per production deployment.

- Fixed $15.000 USD in GHO or USDC, plus gas reimbursement, per Aave V3 production deployment, paid at the activation proposal.

### Next Steps

1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage
3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage
4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal

746,"#### ABSTRACT

This AIP supports the MVP launch of an outdoor digital billboard network, with a primary objective of establishing a long-term sustainable business model that; helps fund the ApeCoin DAO treasury, establishes new use cases for $APE, expands the community of $APE builders, while providing the world with a progressively decentralized platform to showcase messaging and art.

We’ve bootstrapped this startup on our initiative, with our own money, and designed it to provide numerous direct benefits to the $APE ecosystem. We’re asking the $APE community to help us accelerate the concept and increase its chances of success. We hope that by leading with actions instead of promises, with our skin in the game first, and by placing a high priority on driving direct value to the DAO, the Ape community will choose to support this.

If this AIP passes, then; 20% of all top-line revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin DAO treasury until the full cost of this AIP is returned. Anyone can earn a 10% rewards payout from all referrals. Every wallet hodling at least 5k $APE as at January 1st, 2024, will receive free display space on a first come first serve basis. Furthermore, for however long the Ape community continues to support this initiative, a further 1% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin Treasury on-going, plus a quantity of TBD display space will be reserved for use by the ApeCoin DAO, and our Network of frens and fam, such as those at Mocaverse, BAYC, MAYC, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild, and Ape Delegates, for life.

The outdoor digital advertising industry is ripe for disruption and we’re all positioned to spearhead and benefit from this for years to come. Our modernized approach to this old-school industry offers the potential to generate substantially increased operating margins than competitors and opens up the total addressable market (TAM) by an order of magnitude. The conservative financial request in this AIP covers six months of runway for my team and I to carry out up to two consecutive MVP engagements aimed at positioning this initiative for sustainable revenue generation and future scaling.

I initiated this project in Q4 2019 with a personal investment of approximately $40,000. However, the onset of the Covid lockdown in Q1 2020 forced me to put the project on hold. I have now re-commenced the project with @thebossdragon as CTO, having injected a further $10,000 of my own capital in recent weeks.

The first MVP engagement takes place over a 10-day period during the Ethereum Denver Blockchain/Web3 Event scheduled for February/March 2024, with an anticipated attendance of approximately 15,000 Ethereum-related enthusiasts. We’ve leased a truck equipped on 3-sides with sizeable digital display screens to roam the streets of the event area. Its mission is to display messages and art, while recruiting more builders into the Ape ecosystem, and providing all hodlers of at least 1 $APE with an opportunity to help drive value into the DAO treasury while earning rewards for themselves too. If successful, the model will then scale beyond mobile advertising to encompass highway billboards, transit vehicles, bus stop displays, elevator displays, and more.

Accessibility and speed are key features of this initiative. Anyone can purchase a display spot at any time for the minimum purchase price of 0.001 ETH, and have their messaging displayed within 60 seconds or less. Anyone holding 1 $APE can earn referral rewards, and anyone who pays with $APE receives bonus display time for free. Furthermore, a portion of all ad space will be reserved for free use by the ApeCoin DAO as it sees fit, and for our ecosystem frens. One such use could be the promotion of a ‘Build with $APE’ introductory guide and promotional video, which is included in the budget of this AIP, and which would be integrated into this project’s website: [publicbored.com](http://www.publicbored.com/).

The proposed budget encompasses technology development, website development, display rental expenses, marketing efforts, and a total of twelve months to transition into a self-sustaining model.

Subsequent MVP engagements are TBD in 2024.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

1. 20% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin DAO treasury until the full cost of this AIP is returned.
2. Anyone can earn a 10% rewards/payout for all referrals who purchase display time on the digital billboard
4. On-going royalties plus free ads: for as long as the Ape community continues to support this initiative, a further 1% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin Treasury on-going, plus a quantity of TBD ad space on all billboards everywhere shall always be reserved for use by the ApeCoin DAO, and our Network of frens and fam, such as $APE hodlers, Mocaverse, BAYC, MAYC, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild, and Ape Delegates hodling 50k $APE or more, for life.
5. Bonus, free display time is also given to everyone who pays in $APE.
6. Free display space is reserved exclusively for ApeCoin DAO use, such as for recruiting more builders into the Ape ecosystem.
7. We also aim to help recruit more $APE builders, via a guide for new AIP authors posted directly on the Public Bored website to help direct website traffic towards the DAO, or similar.
8. 25% of all revenue generated will be converted into and held in $APE on-going, until the funds need to be used, in which case we will actively seek to pay expenses in $APE wherever practical. For example, part of the cost of the billboard truck has been paid for directly using $APE. This was their first time accepting $APE as payment, and only happened because I specifically asked them to. It was a fun discussion, and they are excited :slight_smile: 

#### OVERALL COST

Total Budget: 75,000 $APE

Approximate allocations:
* Digital Display Truck: 15k $APE
  * Acquisition of cutting-edge mobile canvas
* Website & Technology Development: 20k $APE
  * Advancing innovation through web and tech
* Marketing: 10k $APE
  * Strategic campaigns to amplify impact
* Staffing and Related Expenses: 15k $APE
  * Committed to nurturing a skilled team for twelve consecutive months
* Transportation & Rentals: 5k $APE
  * Facilitating logistics for seamless execution
* Direct Sales: 5k $APE
  * Hands-on engagement for strategic growth
* Miscellaneous Expenses: 5k $APE
  * Navigating unforeseen challenges with resilience
* Possible Second & Third Event Budgets (TBD, based on revenues generated)

747,"Proposal by Karpatkey DAO team

This is a proposal to add GNO, the Gnosisdao’s governance token, as collateral in the Aave v2 protocol.

Gnosisdao is a collective that uses GNO to transparently guide decisions on the development of Gnosis products. It has produced solutions which are widely adopted in our ecosystem, such as the Gnosis Safe multisignature wallet, Zodiac (DAO tooling consisting of Avatars, Modules, Modifiers, and Guards architecture), Gnosis Auction (a platform for conducting fair, transparent, and decentralized batch auctions) and Cowswap (which allows anyone to buy and sell tokens using gas-less orders that are settled peer-to-peer among its users or into any on-chain liquidity source while providing MEV protection), among others.

The GNO token allows its holders to be validators and boost their rewards on the Gnosis Chain network (formerly the xDai Chain). The Gnosis Chain provides stability and scalability. It is a stable EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. The Gnosis Chain currently has a TVL of $290M, with 130k+ transactions a day, an average block time of 5 seconds, and holds over 6.1M wallets.

    What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Karpatkey DAO provides treasury management solutions for DAOs and currently manages Gnosis DAO’s treasury initiatives.

    Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

Please refer to the summary above.

    Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
    GNO’s liquidity is comparable or better than the top 3 DeFi protocol tokens listed on Aave by total supply (AAVE, LINK and MKR). This means it can be sold at large quantities with lower price impact, resulting in a better quality collateral for liquidations. Also, a more liquid asset tends to be less volatile than an illiquid one.

The GnosisDAO community and treasury would be the main interested parties in depositing GNO and borrowing stablecoins, increasing the Ethereum Reserve Factor.

It would set a good precedent to continue working with other GnosisDAO products for tighter Aave integrations, like v3 for Gnosis Chain and Safe apps for multisig users.

    Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Gnosis was founded in 2015 by Martin Koppelmann and Stefan George under ConsenSys, an Ethereum venture production studio. On 23-Nov-2020 GnosisDAO was born, a prediction market-driven collective, stewarding the Gnosis ecosystem through futarchy: governance by prediction markets. Gnosis’ products are the following:

Gnosis Auction: Gnosis Auction is a platform for conducting fair, transparent, and decentralized token price discovery. Batch auctions set the price exactly where supply and demand meet. This ensures the same fair price for all participants. Also, timed batches protect the users from frontrunning.

Zodiac 1: a collection of tools for DAOs, built according to an open standard, which enables DAOs to act more like constellations, connecting platforms, protocols, and chains, no longer confined to monolithic designs.

Conditional Tokens Framework: powering decentralized prediction markets like the Omen platform.

Gnosis Protocol V2: leveraging batch auctions to offer MEV protection, plus integration with liquidity sources across DEXs to provide traders with the best prices. Within the Gnosis Protocol V2, the proof-of-concept CowSwap DEX was born, as well as the Balancer-Gnosis partnership integration, aiming to build a stable version of GPv2 on top of the Balancer V2 vault.

Gnosis Safe: The most trusted platform to manage digital assets on Ethereum, with over 107 billion USD worth of digital assets securely stored. It has web, desktop and mobile versions. Supporting multi-signature, DeFi integrations, enhanced privacy, NFTs storage, gasless signatures. The Gnosis Safe is open source and has been formally verified 2.

    How is the asset currently used?
    GNO is used in the following ways:

    Prediction market-driven governance token
    As the asset required to validate on the Gnosis Chain
    Yield compounding strategies in DeFI (e.g. Balancer, Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.)
    Decentralized borrowing (e.g.: Unit Protocol)
    As a productive asset (e.g.: part of Balancer Protocol’s token swap strategy)

    Emission schedule: There is no emission schedule, the total supply of 10M GNO with most of the supply in the vesting contract locked for 8 years. The total supply will likely be drastically reduced , check the ongoing governance process Should we burn 68% of the total GNO Supply? - GnosisDAO - Gnosis 1

    Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

No additional GNO can be minted.

**Service Provider Name:** Beethoven X DAO - Marketing

**Core Contributor(s):** JediRasta, Naly, Jeff, Vee, Skly, Tom, Josey, Ardordo

**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** Yes

**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):** Yes

**Introduction & Domains of Operation:**

After a three-month trial contract facilitated by Balancer Labs, the Balancer community [passed](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x686cfe15ffd35178814276eaff348b791bfd8fd1684e2731f222e9881df61279) [BIP-254](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-254-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao/4652) to fund Beethoven X DAO as an official Service Provider from May 1, 2023 - July 31, 2023.

Shortly after the ratification of BIP-254, Orb Co. [relinquished its responsibilities of all marketing-related work](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-april-2023-high-level-updates/4735) and has since [released all marketing personnel](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-updated-q2-budget-forecast-5-12-23/4775). These actions created a void wherein a critical service essential for the Balancer ecosystem ceased to exist almost overnight.

In order to ensure a smooth transition and mitigate any harm to the Balancer brand, Beethoven X contributors have activated significant resources to allow us to step in to fill the gap in the domain of marketing/content and are now running the marketing efforts at Balancer.

April 26: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-balancer-marketing-analysis/4705/14?u=jedirasta26
May 4: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/beethoven-x-marketing-update/4731?u=jedirasta26
May 19: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bi-weekly-marketing-update-beethoven-x/4797?u=jedirasta26

As our initial budget did not account for the significant amount of additional work we’ve undertaken over the course of the last month, this proposal seeks to amend BIP-254 in the following ways:

1. Increase funding for marketing/content-related efforts from $15k to $30k per month starting June 1.
2. In an attempt to answer community concerns around having service providers that are “too big,” we will split marketing and technical services into two distinct service provider proposals moving forward. Passage of this proposal would additionally remove the marketing budget from BIP-254.

**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**

Over the past 3 months, the marketing efforts to support Orb were focused on the following key areas:

* Developer Landing Page
* Content and Education
* Social Media Presence

However, in light of the transitions of the Orb marketing team, our efforts over the past month have shifted focus and have been put towards building a foundation to adequately fill the role previously occupied by Orb. To achieve this we have established the following:

* We have defined a strategy for content creation that is focused on highlighting current developments in the Balancer ecosystem.
* We are attending weekly meetings with [@Solarcurve](https://forum.balancer.fi/u/solarcurve) and Maxis to make sure that content is relevant and closely aligned with BD efforts.
* We have created a notion-based system to organize, develop, and schedule content coming out on social media channels and share with all relevant contributors.
* We established a baseline cadence for content coming out on Twitter.
* We have built a base layer of visual assets to support all of the content copy.
* We have begun to develop a distinctive voice/style to authentically represent the Balancer brand.
* We have been working closely with Balancer’s lead designer [@uxui](https://forum.balancer.fi/u/uxui) to develop an aesthetic for the Balancer brand/social media presence.
* We have connected with the Balancer community contributors to begin to define a working relationship, support their contributions and build a framework for future collaboration.
* We have continued to work on the developer landing page.
* We have furthered our relationship with Aura to closely align on the Balancer brand direction and over-arching marketing strategy.

Now that a baseline has been built, our focus moving forward is to showcase Balancer as a highly relevant and flourishing ecosystem. Leveraging our current expertise and familiarity with the ecosystem/tech alongside support from key contributors from the Balancer DAO we aim to achieve this by working on 4 key areas:

1. Social Media
2. Core Growth Pillars
3. Brand Development
4. Long-Term Initiatives

Below we have outlined the intention for these initiatives with relevant KPIs for their measurement/success.

1.Social Media: Twitter is the main point of visibility for the content coming through Balancer and as such it will remain a major priority for our marketing efforts. To continue to build relevancy for the Balancer brand and increase our reach we will be working on the following:

  * Consistent threads focused around the core growth pillars identified with BD.
  * Building rapport with key partners in the space to increase network effect.
  * Refining Balancer's visual style and tone of voice.
  * The inclusion of visual forms of educational content.
  * Community initiatives and a focus on increasing engagement.

KPIs: To measure growth across Twitter we will use the following metrics on a bi-monthly basis. Our hope is to see these figures trend upward over time.

 
![beetsM1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreig4ilgccqfynilp635t7m2ote2ng4ya4n7djlgnzxke7fekecgncm)
    


2.Core Growth Pillars: Re-establishing “relevancy” has been identified as an area that will be critical for the future growth of Balancer’s ecosystem. The following narratives have been outlined as highly relevant to Balancer's success:

  * ve8020
  * LST’s
  * Boosted Pools
  * Building on Balancer

With these core growth pillars identified, our goal is to curate content focused on bringing these pillars to the forefront of users' attention. We aim to achieve this in the following way:

* Focus marketing efforts around highlighting the vast benefits of the ve8020 model. Showcase successful case partner studies with statistics and growth metrics, as well as build out a ve8020 initiative pack to further educate, onboard, and align new participants.
* Continue to highlight the unique technology that sets Balancer apart for hosting and facilitating the growth of Liquid Staked Tokens.
* Showcase the power and effectiveness of Boosted Pools for facilitating ecosystem-wide growth.
* Provide content and material for builders to onboard into the Balancer ecosystem.

KPIs:

* Ve8020: With a push for the adoption of ve8020 we would like to see the number of protocols adopting this governance model increase over the rest of the quarter. Currently, 8 protocols have embraced the initiative, we would like to see this number increase to 15+ protocols by Q3.

* LST dominance: Since Shapella, we have seen LST liquidity on Ethereum rise week after week, with total ETH staked up over 4 million since April. Throughout the next quarter, we expect this to continue to increase with Liquid Staked protocols directly impacted by an influx of capital. With an innovative tech stack tailored to facilitate the growth of Liquid Staked liquidity, Balancer is uniquely positioned to become the dominant hub for these YB asset types. The goal is to see every LST hosted on Balancer increase in % by the start of Q3.

 
![beetsM2.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiapq5p773dkibw67p4uej63jr4bwiqsm2irnvblxcfxzitapkp34q)
    

* Building on Balancer: At the start of our service provider contract we had begun work on a developer-focused landing page. However, during the transition of Orb this project has seen less attention as our focus shifted to building a baseline for operations. With a baseline now in place, the goal for the next 3 months is to have completed a beta version of the Landing Page for the community to test out.

3.Brand Development: One of the major areas identified as having potential for improvement has been the overall design and UX for Balancer. Working closely with lead designer Pon, we have been exploring different avenues for how this could be achieved.

  Over the coming months, we hope to bring to life all of the conceptual work we have done by working on the following:

  * Curate and present to the community 2-3 refined brand aesthetics with UX/UI prototypes.
  * Build out the Balancer developer landing page integrating new brand aesthetic.
  * Incorporate new look and feel into Twitter and content-related efforts.

4.Long-Term Initiatives

Below we have outlined 2 long-term marketing goals.

1.Education (Balancer Media Hub)

The Balancer Media Hub aims to create a central hub dedicated to curating high-quality, engaging content for the Balancer ecosystem. Articles, Videos, and Podcasts, all on one site. With a tech stack uniquely positioned to educate users on a plethora of different DeFi topics, the Balancer Media Hub has the potential to onboard the next wave of DeFi participants. The primary motivations for the development of the media hub are to:

* Facilitate the widespread adoption of users into Balancer/DeFi
* Create a space where educational content is accessible, fun, and engaging.
* Continue to push the evolution of the Balancer marketing department
* Build a foundation for the community to contribute to the growth and education of Balancer.
* Make sure that we stay not only relevant but “ahead of the curve” moving into the future.

2.Community Development

We are strong believers in grassroots movements and want to encourage community contributions in our marketing efforts. Our aim would be to foster community content creators to contribute towards the larger efforts of education in DeFi. By incentivizing users with innovative financial gamification mechanisms, we could create an initiative that would provide a platform for community members to showcase content relevant to the ecosystem in the following ways:

* Serve as a space of development for engaged community members and a space of inspiration for aspiring members.
* Introduce structures of gamification that add to participation and interaction within our community dynamic.
* Provide a framework for engagement that would have an effect on both visibility and education.
* Create a network of trust which allows the community to thrive.
* Potentially integrate into the Balancer Media hub to help scale community contributions

**Deprioritization of PR and Live Events:**

This is an area that previously received a significant amount of resources from the Orb marketing team. While we value the potential upside this type of marketing can bring, we feel that the cost-benefit doesn’t justify the continuation of these efforts. For the time being, we have chosen to sunset these domains for our marketing strategy and will instead focus on the areas described above. This means that we will not be actively pursuing PR-related activity or officially organizing/attending live events as part of our service provider contributions.

**Length of Engagement & Budget:**

For the services described above, we are requesting an increase in the current funding outlined in BIP-254 for marketing-related efforts from $15k per month to $30k per month starting from June 1, 2023, until July 31, 2023.

As part of this proposal, we would also like to make a formal revision to BIP-254. Presently, we offer both technical and non-technical services to the Balancer ecosystem under one service provider proposal. If accepted by the Balancer community, the passing of this proposal would split our services into 2 distinctive proposals; one service provider contract for technical services and another for marketing services. Moving forward this would mean that we will always request marketing budget changes/renewals separately, and any complaints/objections for marketing services would be treated as separate issues from the technical services provided.

As these funds will be used to cover contributor salaries, we request that this amount be made available in a liquid form. If approved, $30,000 USDC or BAL equivalent would be sent to the below ETH address around the first of each month.

Title: [ARFC] Harmonize USDT Risk Parameters on Aave V3 Markets 
Author: Aave Chan Initiative
Created: 2023-11-11

---

# Summary

USDT has various risk parameters across the various Aave v3 markets. This proposals aims to harmonize the risk parameters to better align the markets by removing USDT from isolation mode and normalizing risk parameters.

# Motivation

USDT has seen strong borrow demand across networks with borrow utilization over 50% on Aave v3 Ethereum Mainnet and good utilization on secondary networks. However, the various markets currently have different risk parameters, leading to some inefficiency.

This proposal aims to bring the various USDT markets in line with a single set of LTV, liquidation threshold, and liquidation bonus parameters.

# Specification

The proposal sets the LT/LTV of USDT on all deployments at 80/77, matching that of DAI and USDC on v3 Ethereum. Regarding the LB, it will stay the same at 5% on the L2s and 4.5% on Ethereum.
 
![Params USDT.png](ipfs://bafkreidwofkwkptb4m6napyclkuzqbyf63um2hdhlcvkx5evtuobnznmcq)

# Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.
3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

title: [ARFC] Extend Safety Module Coverage to Polygon v3
Author: @Llamaxyz and 3SE
Dated: 2023-02-14

---

# Summary

The proposal presents Aave the opportunity to extend the Safety Module coverage to include Polygon v3.

# Abstract

The Safety Module is a set of smart contracts allowing AAVE & aBPT (representing Balancer V1 ETH/AAVE LP) token holders to stake their tokens in exchange for a share of the distribution of Safety Incentives sourced from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.

Stakers in the safety module, lock their liquidity for a minimum of 10 days, and in the case of a shortfall event affecting the covered Aave markets, expose their stake assets to be mobilised to cover excess protocol debt up to 30% of their staked funds.

A Snapshot vote will determine if Aave extends the coverage of the Safety module to Aave Polygon v3. There is currently $154.80m of TVL deployed on Polygon v3.

# Motivation

Aave v3 is the most recent implementation of the Aave protocol, allowing new features, optimizations, and mitigation of risks.

Aave v3 has been battle tested for ~11 months in several networks, and its code was deemed safe enough to be allowed deployment on the Ethereum mainnet by the Aave governance.

The authors are supportive of extending coverage of Aave v3 by the safety module in order to offer the Polygon v3 users the same level of coverage as v2 users.

Soon, rewards are to be distributed across the v3 deployment encouraging v2 users to migrate. Extend the Safety Module to the v3 deployment further supports the migration of user’s capital to the v3 deployment. To help facilitate this, BGD has released a migration tool which can be accessed Aave the Aave front end.

# Specification

If a Short Fall event was to occur, similar to the CRV excess debt event during 2022, an ARC is required to determine how Aave is to respond. If Aave elects to proceed with auctioning funds held in the Safety Module, this will be implemented via an AIP.

This proposal is for Aave to agree in principle, via Snapshot, to set a precedent that the Polygon v3 deployment will be supported by the Safety Module if a short fall event were to occur.

A successful Snapshot vote which follows the AIP voting criteria will determine if the Safety Module is extended to cover the Polygon v3 market.

**The Proposal**

The DEXG liquidity on Balancer surpassed >3$M with a total liquidity of $3.8M currently pooled. Therefore we propose to increase the capFactor from cap1 to cap2.

**What is DEXG?**

DEXG is the governance token of the DEXToken Protocol. The DEXToken Protocol creates a unique DeFi infrastructure, featuring a revolutionary AMM and utilising the off-chain capabilities of the Flowchain IoT network.

760,"# Summary

Reduce stablecoin LTs and LTVs across all markets.

# Motivation

In response to the volatility risks highlighted by the UNI incident on Compound, this proposal aims to mitigate theoretical debt asset volatility by proposing a reduction in collateral asset borrowing power for stablecoins. While the UNI debacle was attributed to inadequate dual-bounded fallback oracle logic, a property not employed by Aave, leading to mispriced UNI debt and subsequent arbitrage activities, the observed upward volatility in longer-tailed assets suggests a prevailing ""risk-on"" market sentiment. Therefore, we advocate for minimizing borrowing power concerning shorting these assets to prevent potential short squeezes and liquidation shortfalls. Subsequent recommendations will address borrow cap reductions for relevant long-tailed assets, which generate minimal revenue relative to the theoretical risks, especially in edge-case scenarios. 

We will implement some of the recommendations in two increments to mitigate the impact on users and allow them to adjust their positions. The current total value liquidated following the first step of reductions is ~$24K.

# Recommendations

| Assets | LT | LTV | Total Liquidated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USDC, USDT, DAI  | 80% → 79% | 77% → 76% | $18k |
| USDC.e, USDbC  | 80% → 79% | 77% → 76% | $1.8k |
| USDC (Avalanche) | 86.25% → 85% | 82% → 80% | $2.3k |
| USDT (Avalanche) | 80% → 78% | 77% → 75% | 0 |
| DAI (Avalanche) | 82% → 80% | 75% | 27 |
| FRAX (Avalanche) | 80% → 78% | 75% | 0 |
| LUSD, sDAI, xDAI | 80% → 79% | 77% → 76% | 0 |
| USDC.e (Optimism) | 85% → 84% | 80% → 78% | 9 |
| DAI (Optimism) | 83% → 80% | 78% → 75% | $13 |

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Add ggAVAX to AAVE v3 on Avalanche 

Author: @b_tanyeri Founder at Daybreak Digital, an Avalanche focused crypto fund

Created: 2023-12-08

---

# Summary

This TEMP CHECK proposes to add ggAVAX, a liquid staking token for the Gogopool protocol, to AAVE V3 Avalanche market.

# Motivation

Gogopool is one of the premiere liquid staking protocols on Avalanche. They have over 100 active minipool node operators, and over 250,000 ggAVAX minted on Avalanche’s c-chain. Allowing ggAVAX to be used as collateral with a trusted partner such as AAVE will enhance both ggAVAX liquidity as well as AAVE’s dominance in the Avalanche ecosystem.

# Specification

Project: Gogopool Website
Twitter: Official Twitter
Official Documentation: Docs
ggAVAX contract: ggAVAX Contract
^ please note this is using snowtrace.dev as snowtrace.io is being retired at month end
Balancer: ggAVAX-WAVAX pool

*Note*
ggAVAX enjoys deep liquidity on the c-chain, with over just under $5m in the ggAVAX/WAVAX balancer pool.

In order to create a reliable price feed for ggAVAX for Avalanche for AAVE to utilize, I propose we incorporate the appropriate getRate function from the ggAVAX contract and combine it with existing AVAXUSD chainlink price feeds.

# Next Steps:

1. Gather the AAVE community’s feedback on this proposal.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to TEMP CHECK snapshot stage.
3. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is yes, escalate to ARFC.
4. If consensus on ARFC is reached with appropriate technical details added, then escalate to ARFC snapshot.
5. If ARFC snapshot approved, then escalate to AIP Stage.

# Disclosure
I am in investor into the Gogopool protocol. I run minipools and have exposure to both the platform and the GGP token.

This TEMP CHECK is powered by ACI Skywards.
The Aave Chan Initiative has not received any form of compensation for creating this proposal.

Using current and past proposals as a data set, here is the average length spent in each proposal phase:

AIP Idea: 7 days
AIP Draft: 23.17 days
Live AIP: 6 days

The AIP Idea and Live AIP time ranges are appropriate, but the length of the average AIP Draft phase is suboptimal. There is a good opportunity here to improve upon this process and make it more efficient, allowing the DAO to accomplish more.

#### Proposal to Launch veCAKE Gauges System on zkSync

As mentioned in our initial [**veCAKE proposal**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), we are launching veCAKE in phases, and are excited to share the next deployment - zkSync!

#### Recap: Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

As a quick summary, here’s quick recap of veCAKE, with the following utilities:

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders will be able to directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE managers and bribe markets, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE rewards and receive voting incentives for doing so. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to automate their voting and potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
#### Inclusion of zkSync in veCAKE Gauges System

Currently, the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum is **~0.99 CAKE/block**.  

With the inclusion of zkSync, the current **Trading Allocation** emission of 0.0131 CAKE per block directed towards zkSync Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions. 

As part of the voting gauges design, the Kitchen proposes to retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs, such as ETH-USDC on zkSync. 



There are two key reasons:
- To ensure a smooth transition for liquidity providers from farms managed by the Kitchen to farms which are managed by veCAKE voting, without affecting their APRs significantly in the initial rollout
- To ensure that core liquidity pools continue to receive sufficient incentives, so that liquidity depth and fee generation are not significantly affected. This will ensure the continuity of CAKE burns from trading fees, which drives deflationary CAKE tokenomics.

In the initial rollout phase, the Kitchen will distribute these votes based on the following principles:
- Ensuring core liquidity pools are provided a competitive return on their LP positions
- Ensuring that existing Syrup Pool partner arrangements are met before migrating them fully to the veCAKE gauge voting system
- Ensuring that any of the smaller farms which did not receive any votes after the launch of veCAKE will receive at least some allocation in the initial rollout, capped at their current emission levels.

With the proposed vote allocation, the Kitchen will distribute its share of votes at the end of each voting epoch after all voting participants have voted. 

In other words, the Kitchen will apply its voting share (at maximum, translating to ~0.4 CAKE/block) as far as needed to smoothen out any possible abrupt changes in the Farms, while allowing veCAKE participants to get used to the gauge voting mechanism. 

If the gauge voting results will not affect any core liquidity pools and trading volumes significantly, the Kitchen will abstain from voting in that particular voting epoch or vote in alignment with existing votes.

Over time, the Kitchen aims to reduce the portion of CAKE emissions directly managed by the Kitchen as all veCAKE participants become familiar with the process.

More information can be found in our [**docs**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/vecake/gauges-voting/faq). 

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE launched shortly on zkSync after this vote concludes.",bullish

title: [Proposal] Whitelist the Aave Mainnet Reserve Factor for Balancer’s VoteEscrow
status: Proposed
author: @Matthew_Graham (Llama)
created: 23-04-2022

---

# Summary

The proposal aims to add Aave DAO’s Reserve Factor address to the Balancer VotingEscrow whitelist. This will enable the Aave Community to vote-lock BAL (B-80BAL-20WETH) and participate in Balancer DAO’s governance, [1].

# Abstract

Llama has published proposals on the Aave DAO and Balancer DAO governance forum for both communities to perform a 200,000 BAL for AAVE tokenswap, [2,3,4]. Upon completing this tokenswap, Aave intends to deposit BAL and ETH into the B-80BAL-20WETH pool. This proposal is to enable Aave to vote-lock BAL (B-80/20 BAL/ETH) and become an active contributor within the Balancer governance process.

# Motivation

Aave and Balancer communities have a long working relationship. Aave has incorporated the 80/20 AAVE/ETH Balancer V1 BPT into the Safety Module and intends to upgrade to using a Balancer V2 pool in time. Meanwhile, Balancer’s USDC/DAI/USDT Boosted Pool uses Aave V2 in the background as a source of yield for liquidity providers. Both communities have demonstrated the ability to work together and create value for each other’s community. The tokenswap is the next logical step in creating an ever stronger relationship.

At the time of writing the Aave mainnet Reserve Factor holds 1,924 aBAL and this will become around 201,924 BAL post tokenswap, [2,5]. If the Aave community elects to proceed with an on-market purchase of 100,000 BAL, the total BAL holding will become 301,924 and Aave will become one of the Top 30 holders [6,7]. Aave intends to use the veBAL holding to actively participate in Balancer’s governance process and to support the pools that lead to funds being deposited into Aave markets and/or Safety Module.

# Risks

No significant risks have been identified in connection with the proposed transaction.

# Specification

Whitelist `0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c` to interact with the veBAL contract, [5].

768,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Back Rangers Protocol ($RPG) to Syrup Pool!

CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from **Rangers Protocol**. Rangers Protocol is a future-oriented virtual world blockchain infrastructure, integrating cross-chain, NFT, and EVM protocols. 

#### What is Boost?

Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, the RPG-BUSD farm will go to a 1x multiple for 48 hours, then 0.5x thereafter. Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the boosted period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.
 
At the same time, there will be a delicious, new RPG Syrup Pool with 58,700 RPG tokens to be earned by staking CAKE. Get your CAKE ready!


#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn RPG tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 58,700 RPG
- **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on April 29th 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on May 29th 2022
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.06794 RPG

#### Max Stake per wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### What is $RPG?

From the team: “RPG (Rangers Protocol Gas) is Rangers Protocol's ecosystem token. The main use cases of RPG are as follows:

- Developers building on, distributing, and operating their applications based on Rangers Protocol need to use RPG for gas fees.
- Users need to use RPG when using applications that have been deployed on Rangers Protocol as payments to application developers. When users use Rangers Protocol for transfers, they also need to use RPG for usage or gas fees.”

#### To learn more, visit the project’s official channels:

- **Telegram:** https://t.me/RangersProtocol

- **Discord:** https://discord.com/invite/KMGd755zu9

#### How do you stake CAKE to earn $RPG rewards?

Follow this guide to staking in Syrup Pools: 

**[https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/syrup-pool/syrup-pool-guide](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/syrup-pool/syrup-pool-guide)**

The official RPG token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:  

**https://bscscan.com/token/0xc2098a8938119a52b1f7661893c0153a6cb116d5**

Any other RPG token will be a scam and will result in a financial loss. Always verify the token address before purchasing tokens. If you receive a RPG token airdrop from another address, it’s probably a scam and we advise you to ignore them.",neutral

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market 

Author: [@mv_Trident]

Created: 2023-12-18

---

# Summary

This AIP proposes the onboarding of the PYUSD stablecoin, minted by Paxos Trust Company, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.

# Motivation

PYUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin minted through Paxos. While it’s still young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $230M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:

- Build synergies between Aave and PYUSD.
- Offer Aave users an additional stablecoin option.
- Strengthen the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin. (Trident may explore the deployment of a PYUSD/GHO pool)

We propose a PYUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.

If the community deems that PYUSD as collateral is immediately viable we stand ready to support that role on day one; otherwise following PYUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for PYUSD at a later stage.

# Specification

Ticker: PYUSD
Contract address: [0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8])https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8)

*Liquidity and Market Cap*

The PYUSD token was introduced a few months ago, and since its launch, its market cap has increased to approximately $230million. Over the coming weeks the pool will be scaled further with incentives in order to reach the necessary liquidity to support the proposed market parameters.

![PayPal USD Price Chart.png](ipfs://bafkreihqq36bcffddfsnmcz4m4gda4pcopqktjs4rdneanq4q4pggkesfm)
    
When analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at the available historical data. The 30 Day average Market Cap of PYUSD is $170M with a 30 day average volume of $4.7M. Over the last 7 days, the average Market cap has climbed to $209M with the same period seeing an average volume of $8.7M, the volume and aum increase is on the back of prior stakeholder efforts and we expect both to grow meaningfully in the coming weeks.

With peg holding well since inception, an average intra-day volatility of ~0.01%, and the ability of onboarded institutional investors to redeem PYUSD 1:1 with Paxos, we see low risk related to the stability of PYUSD’s price.

*Initial Supply and Borrow Caps*

PYUSD circulating supply is ~$230M. Given PYUSD is a new asset listing, we recommend adopting a conservative approach for setting supply and borrow caps for PYUSD, which gives room to expand caps should cap usage be elevated. We recommend a supply cap of 25M and a borrow cap of 20M.

*Variable Borrow Rate*

We recommend setting slope 1 to 7% due to current on-chain stable yield opportunities which we believe will remain viable for the foreseeable future.

*Borrowable in Isolation*

We do not see excess risk with enabling PYUSD being borrowable in isolation. If the community wishes to take a more conservative stance, it may wish to only limit PYUSD borrowing to non-isolated collateral.

# Next Steps:

1. Gather community feedback on this TEMP CHECK.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to TEMP CHECK snapshot stage.
3. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.
4. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
5. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage

**Introduction**
Whitelist the VitaDAO Gnosis Safe multisig, to vote-lock the B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the VitaDAO community into veBAL and participate in governance for the Balancer DAO, and vote on increased rewards for the Vita<>ETH pools.

**Motivation**
VitaDAO is a community DAO funding longevity research, and is a big fan and longer-term collaborator with Balancer, having its main liquidity pools listed with Balancer, and incentivising them with $vita rewards.

If the community would support it, we'd love to engage in Balancer DAO governance through veBAL.

**Risks**
VitaDAO multisig signers recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

**Specification**
Whitelist the VitaDAO Gnosis Safe multisig, 0xF5307a74d1550739ef81c6488DC5C7a6a53e5Ac2, to interact with the veBAL contract.",bullish

776,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Ultimate Champions ($CHAMP) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Ultimate Champions! 

The Ultimate Champions is a free-to-play fantasy sports platform with officially licensed NFT player cards that you can fully own, collect, and trade!

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn CHAMP tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 1,695,000 CHAMP
 - **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1300 UTC on 3 Feb 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1300 UTC on 5 Mar 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 1.961 CHAMP

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the CHAMP Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a CHAMP-BUSD farm.  


The farm will have 0.2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.1x rewards after that. During and at the end of the 30-day period – approx. 1300 UTC on 5 Mar 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.1x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $CHAMP?

From the team: “$CHAMP is the Utility Token that powers the economy in Ultimate Champions games, such as football and basketball. Players with CHAMPS can utilize it as such: 

* Use $CHAMP to purchase all in-game NFT Athlete cards or packs
* Use $CHAMP to trade NFTs and earn rewards in the game”

782,"#### ABSTRACT

Brand New Vision, a digital fashion ecosystem builder, has recently launched a dapp named ME:ID ([id.bnv.me](http://id.bnv.me/)). BNV aims to bring Web3 self-expression at its highest form to the Apecoin ecosystem.

All Apecoin holders will get access to a range of Apecoin gated digital wearables and accessories branded by IPs owned by Yuga Labs in ME:ID which they can use to create personal real time 3D avatars (see example: [001 | ME:ID – Style looks and create your 3D profile](https://id.bnv.me/001)) and enter the Fashion Battle Royale powered by Apecoin.

![Sample Collection based on Apecoin Branding](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/a/acd72c5eddc5b888894db0d1b50f2caad52056b0_2_1380x776.jpeg)

Prize money in Apecoin will be available to attract audiences outside of the ecosystem to encourage them to Ape in. For those who already have strong connections with their digital avatars, this will be a huge opportunity for their digital alter-egos to be seen at a fashion week event in Paris in early 2024.

BNV has previously executed fashion events, activations, catwalk shows and parties during multiple Paris, London and Copenhagen Fashion Weeks.

![WEINSANTO PHOTOCALL5609](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/b/b6dd49e68ecb40d0fe8c2d4c6d6985fa12fbd06d_2_800x1000.jpeg)

We believe this will put the spotlight on the fashion relevance of the family of IPs of the Apecoin ecosystem like never before.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

Fashion and culture are 2 sides of the same coin, Apecoin’s mission is to promote all things culture in Web3 and ME:ID is all about visualising culture through the lens of fashion. ME:ID aggregates a wide range of culture in the form of fashion, art, music, dance, sports, memes and anything that helps one express his/her/their primal instincts and visual identities. BNV is confident a well executed competition in the form of battle royale with large bottom up exposure on social media platforms can definitely help further Apecoin DAO’s mission.

This collaboration can attract a wide range of fashion forward hypebeasts and digital-native creators from outside the Apecoin Community to interact and create ME:IDs with a wide range of NFT assets and visual creativity that they possess to inject new energy and new vibes into the Apecoin Ecosystem as well as massively promoting Apecoin ecosystem IPs by taking full advantage of algorithm based social platforms such as Tiktok and IG Reels.

#### OVERALL COST

25,000 $APE to fund the prize pool for the top 3 winning ME:ID profiles

$70,000 USD equivalent in $Ape for organising the IRL fashion event in Paris showing off the ME:IDs of the top 8 finalists of the Fashion Battle Royale as well as notable ME:ID avatars from the entire competition.

783,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.


## Specification

This past week did not see outsized changes in market conditions nor within the Aave protocol. There were slight volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets. Our platform recommends the following set of parameter changes that will decrease liquidation bonuses on several less-utilized assets.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAL Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |
| DPI Loan To Value     | 65%     | 70%     |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| DPI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |
| ENJ Loan To Value    | 60%     | 70%     |
| MANA Loan To Value    | 65%     | 70%     |
| MKR Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| UNI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |





## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2.

   * Keep DIGG emissions the same as Q1 2022.
   * The net result is 20,000 BADGER per week emitted from the treasury in Q2 vs. 27,802 in the last week of Q1. This is a 28% reduction in emissions.
   * bveCVX is currently buying more than 12k BADGER per week and distributing it to its HODLers. This both creates buy pressure for more than half the treasury emitted tokens and makes up for the reduction in emissions to other Vaults.

793,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across two (2) Aave V3 Optimism assets.

## Motivation

Chaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. 

*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*

Please find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).

You can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).

The output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC and DAI on V3 Optimism, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with no effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)

**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$155,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**

### Liquidity Analysis:

The TVL in Aave on Optimism (118.71M$) is concentrated primarily on three blue-chip, high-liquidity assets, which together account for ~75% of the supplied assets in $ values: USDC (34%), WETH (28%), and WBTC (14%). Based on our analysis, we recommend increasing the Loan-To-Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold (LT) for WBTC and DAI, as we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support significant liquidations. Similarly, we recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty for WBTC, which is set conservatively at 10% to a lower level (8.5%) closer to that of USDC and Ethereum (5%).

### Positions Analysis

We have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations. However, we should call out that  ~40% of the on-chain supply of WBTC on Optimism is currently held on Aave, which calls for some caution. We have already proposed and implemented an [amendment to the supply cap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-chaos-labs-supply-and-borrow-cap-updates-aave-v3-2023-02-24/12048/4) to limit the concentration of liquidity on Aave.

Given the blue-chip nature of BTC/WBTC, we expect significant arbitrage buying pressure to offset any slippage that may be created by future liquidations of WBTC and, therefore, recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty even with the current significant liquidity concentration on Aave. We expect a lower LP to drive liquidators to liquidate positions in smaller portions, pacing the process and allowing the market more time to react. 

### Recommendations

| Asset | Parameter | Current | Rec | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WBTC | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 78% | +3% |
| WBTC | Loan-to-Value | 70% | 73% | +3% |
| WBTC | Liquidation Penalty | 10% | 8.5% | -1.5% |

This proposal aims to expand the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem through the creation of an animated series pilot and three spin-off comic books, featuring characters owned by ApeCoin DAO holders. We envision a gritty, action-packed, and comedic, anime-inspired adaptation of the American Ape comic book series that prominently features ApeCoin as the primary currency of the Metaverse, reaching beyond the echo chamber of “Crypto Twitter” that is primed to be pitched directly to international streamers via our producing team’s existing development, production and distribution pipelines.

#### OVERALL COST

The team is requesting $300,000 USD in $APE to produce the animated series pilot and three (3) spin-off comics, expanding the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem’s lore and raising awareness of the ApeCoin ecosystem through an ongoing mainstream animated television show and secure an international distribution deal for the comic books.

> # Summary
>
> * This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for stataOptUSDT/stataOptUSDCn on Optimism.
> * The underlying pool is a Rehype Pool, an extension of Gyroscope's E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.
> * The pool shall have a swap fee of 0.5 basis points, i.e., 0.005% at pool inception. A protocol fee of 30% will be set upon incentives going live. This may be changed later upon mutual discussion (this is a new Rehype pool type and fees and growth may need to be fine tuned). At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.

> # Motivation
>
>
> Rehype pools reach new efficiency heights while staying simple and therefore safer. Rehype pools embrace a simple, modular design that doesn't introduce new smart contract code for rehypothecation. Rehype pools thus inherit the security record of E-CLPs. 
>
> The complexity of Rehype pools is handled in the more flexible layers of order routing and front end interface instead of in smart contracts.
At the same time, they keep everything transparent on-chain and keep users in control, in contrast to common rehypothecation in TradFi.

798,"This proposal has two principles to empower Ultrasound CAKE.


1. Increase the MAX CAPS (proposed weight gauges) for the CAKE pool from 35% to 60%.


Pros - This will undoubtedly encourage more CAKE staking, consequently strengthening the entire community and reducing selling pressure.


2. Develop a new aggressive reduction plan (around 50%) of emissions to take place over the next 4 months.


Pros - It is crucial to signal greater scarcity of CAKE to the market. All holders stand to gain from this measure. And this could happen until the BTC halving to take advantage of the bull run - THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TIMING.


Cons - This two proposals may decrease CAKE reward in farms. However, perform an analysis. There are two types of suppliers:


1. The holder
2. Those who sell CAKE to increase their APR farm.


The holder will not be bothered by these measures as they will benefit from them. However, those who sell CAKE will have two alternatives. Either they will start to become holders, which is beneficial for the community, or they will lose some selling CAKE rewards. But okay, they can continue selling, as the selling pressure will decrease significantly, and soon they will realize that selling CAKE is a bad deal.


I have been with CAKE since day 1. I saw CAKE go from $0.29 to 13, then 22, and reaching 44. 


Today, the protocol built by the devs, who deserve ENORMOUS RESPECT AND CONGRATULATIONS FROM THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY for their work, is much better than when it reached above 40. So, we need to instill more confidence to holde CAKE and to reduce the constant ""every day selling"" from farm´s by those who are only interested in increasing APR. Even these individuals should benefit because with a higher CAKE price, the supplier's CAKE reward will be greater.


Devs... it´s all about CAKE!! Let's empower Ultrasound CAKE with more deflation.",bullish

It has been well documented by Xeonus and others that the DAO will run out of stablecoins sometime in Q3/Q4 2023 based on current numbers. While progress has been made to increase revenue it would still be prudent to extend the DAO’s runway sooner than later. An opportunity has emerged to cleanly convert BAL to USDC using Aave’s [one way bonding curve](https://etherscan.io/address/0x04f90d449d4f8316edd6ef4f963b657f8444a4ca#readContract) contract. This takes BAL and gives out USDC at the chainlink oracle price of BAL/USD + 50bps.

There is ~91.6k BAL left to be filled out of the total 100k BAL. The DAO would gain ~$571k USDC if this swap was made today. You can confirm this number by calling the 7. `getAmountOut` function on etherscan.

This can effectively be viewed as a treasury swap with Aave DAO, BAL for USDC. This BAL would be used by them to lock in veBAL and vote for Aave boosted pools. Aave is a very important long term partner for Balancer which makes this an appealing option for raising stablecoins.

I recognize this could be a controversial decision but the opportunity to use this bonding curve contract might disappear at any moment so we will need to act quickly if we want to pursue this. Pending how the discussion goes I think we should plan on a December 8th vote.

### Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction with the BAL token contract `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d` calling the `approve` function with the following arguments:

Spender: 0x04f90d449D4f8316eDd6Ef4F963b657f8444a4cA

Amount: The current value from calling 6. amountBalToBeFilled [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x04f90d449d4f8316edd6ef4f963b657f8444a4ca#readContract), which is 91661437022397199910676 at the moment

Next, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction with the bonding curve contract `0x04f90d449D4f8316eDd6Ef4F963b657f8444a4cA` calling the `purchase` function with the following arguments:
