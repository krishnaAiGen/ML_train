2,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to pause ETH borrowing in the period leading up to the Ethereum Merge. 

In addition, the original forum post also proposed transferring a one-time payment of 60 AAVE from the Aave treasury to the MakerDAO pause proxy in connection to the [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-ethpow-fork-risk-mitigation-plan/9438#:~:text=103%25%20to%201%2C000%25.-,AAVE%20Payment,-If%20this%20proposal). In this Snapshot vote, we also provide the options to vote for this payment.

## Abstract

Ahead of the Ethereum Merge, the Aave protocol faces the risk of high utilization in the ETH market. Temporarily pausing ETH borrowing will mitigate this risk of high utilization.

## Motivation

Full details are provided in the original [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-ethpow-fork-risk-mitigation-plan/9438).

The risk of high utilization in the ETH market is driven by users potentially benefiting from the forked PoW ETH (ETHW) by borrowing ETH before the merge. High utilization interferes with liquidation transactions, thus increasing the chances of insolvency for the protocol. In addition, a high ETH borrow rate can make stETH/ETH recursive positions unprofitable, increasing the chances that users unwind their positions and drive the stETH/ETH price deviation further, causing additional liquidations and insolvency.


## Specification
* Calling `disableBorrowingOnReserve` to disable ETH borrowing.

The options for this Snapshot vote are as follows: 

1. Yes (temporarily pause ETH borrowing) and pay 60 AAVE tokens
2. Yes (temporarily pause ETH borrowing) and decide on payment later. The community can revisit the proposed payment later, but that should not block the community from taking action (pause ETH borrowing) to derisk Aave in the interim
3. No (do not pause ETH borrowing)
4. Abstain

## Next Steps
* Targeting an AIP on 2022-09-02.

3,"Recently it was announced the FEI Protocol would be winding down operations and liquidating their assets.  


A proposal was made to allow TRIBE Dao to lock their BAL into veBAL 
here https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allow-tribe-dao-to-lock-vebal/2888 

Part of the reason why ve systems disallow contracts from locking by default is because it is trivial to make that locked position liquid by reassigning the owner of the contract.  This functionally means that anyone locking from a contract/safe would be at an advantage to those who lock through an EOA if we tolerated free transfer of contract locked veBAL ownership freely.  

Recently there have been talks about Tribe selling their veBAL position OTC to interested parties by transferring ownership of a contract that would give ownership of said veBAL position. While I fully sympathize with their desire to sell their veBAL, I personally believe we should not set the precedent of allowing DAO's to freely transfer their locked positions.

What we can do on our side is call denyListAddress on the [SmartWalletChecker](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7869296Efd0a76872fEE62A058C8fBca5c1c826C) contract which will disable the ability to relock any more veBAL from that contract. This forces the position to gracefully expire and unlock, meaning it would need to fully expire for anyone to max lock it again.  In the meantime, they can still direct emissions, collect veBAL rewards, and boost LP positions.  This is, in my opinion, a good middle ground.  

#### In summary:
If someone locks veBAL and they can transfer ownership freely, *did they really lock veBAL? :slight_smile:* 

I would like to hear other opinions on this topic.  This discussion is not meant to single anyone out but rather provide us an opportunity to set precedence over how contract locked veBAL positions can be transferred.

### Specification
The DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) will call denyListAddress on the SmartWalletChecker Contract at 0x7869296Efd0a76872fEE62A058C8fBca5c1c826C with the contractAddress parameter being TribeDAO’s address",bearish
4,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BSC etc.

As described on the Aave governance forum [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-bored-ghosts-developing-bgd/7527), BGD Labs has presented a proposal to provide development services to the Aave ecosystem, on the terms presented on the forum.
We create this preliminary (off-chain) Snapshot vote, in order to get approval from the community on the outlined proposal.

We are near completion for an on-chain strategy game inspired by Settlers of Catan, titled
“The Battle for Goblin Town.”  [See Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoblinTown_Game)
 ![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/10e5bf8b8d49d45dd8ef3c8716c461af89745846.gif)
Actual gameplay footage. Image shows resource tiles, settlements, roads and in-progress battles

BFGT combines the joy and nostalgia of a tabletop experience with the ownership and utility of web3, with a strategic decision-making system driven by economic game theory.

Our initial plan was to independently launch the game in a more open manner but after discussions with key ApeCoin DAO members it became clear that our game could provide significant value to this community by making it exclusive to ApeCoin.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Our intention with this AIP is to create an economically self-sustaining video game that lives on for a long time. We see this game providing real utility and enjoyment to the ApeCoin DAO and ApeCoin holders while introducing new users to the ApeCoin Ecosystem.
* DAO REVENUE: -15% of the mint and ongoing game revenue will be returned directly to the ApeCoin DAO. -15% of ApeCoin generated during mint and ongoing game revenue will be burned (that is, transferred to a dead address, effectively removing it from circulation and reducing the supply). This creates what we believe is the first true ApeCoin Sink. -20% of ongoing game revenue will go towards supporting future prize pool (or burn).
* VOTER AIRDROP: Voters who vote on this proposal will receive an airdrop of NFT Chests at a rate of 1 crate per 1,000 votes). Chests contain gameplay pieces: screelings, bosses, structures and cards. These pieces are NFTs that can either be used in-game or traded. Regarding the airdrop, the original holders will receive the crates, NOT the people they have delegated their ApeCoin to. To address this we will use the karma api to track delegates [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26295147/2s93RTPrfg](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26295147/2s93RTPrfg)
* $APE EXCLUSIVE: $APE will be used exclusively as the as the currency for minting and any non-resource purchases to buy into the game
* For example: during gameplay, $APE can be used to buy card packs (card previews below)

THE MINT
The mint will be a 72 hour “open edition” to get crates for your initial game pieces. (Only one crate is required to play, but we expect most users will want to start with multiple crates).

Expand the ApeCoin gaming ecosystem
* Establish another strong Web3 game in the ApeCoin ecosystem
* Provide diversity to the ecosystem by releasing a new genre of Web3 game
* Growth in community through new players, cross-promotion with other ApeCoin games, and improved user retention

Marketing
* Improve brand visibility and attract a wider audience
* Extend ApeCoin to a new demographic of players
* Use of ApeCoin mark
The Battle for Goblin Town is directly aligned with the APE Community’s vision to be the foundation of Web3 culture through gaming, arts, and entertainment. We designed a game that embodies Web3 culture by focusing on the following goals:

Engaging and Fun
* The main motivation for developing The Battle for Goblin Town was to produce an entertaining, engaging, and social game. Never. Be. Bored.
* We wanted to capture the same feeling that you get from playing any classic tabletop board game with your friends and family. A family that games together, stays together!
* The core game loop is simple: Take over Goblin Town!
* Players may accomplish this in many different ways, from forming alliances with their closest friends, negotiating trades with their neighbors, and taking calculated risks to expand your territory or destroy your enemies’ territories.
 Innovation
* On-chain gaming
    * NFT integration to provide true ownership of game assets
* New gaming genre that combines strategy, social interaction, and “yield-farming”-style mechanisms

Play-to-Earn Mechanics
* Collectors
    * Unique and various rarity NFT collections between Goblin Bosses and Screelings (see photos below)
* Competitors
    * Establish prize pool to reward top players after each season
* Opportunist
    * Players may take advantage of economic opportunities on secondary markets by landing rare Bosses and Screelings, or farming booster packs


##### OVERALL COST 
TOTAL: $2m (USD) in ApeCoin
* 1.5m (USD) in ApeCoin
* 500k (USD) in ApeCoin to be distributed as a prize pool across the first 3 seasons.

*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

10,"[PR for multisig payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/58)

### Motivation

Now that the public disclosure regarding the issue has been made and new pool factories have been deployed it’s time to begin the “Great Migration”. As a reminder many of our current pools are no longer paying protocol fees but are otherwise completely safe - all fees are simply going to LP’s.

This first wave represents some of our higher priority pools and more will follow in at least one more wave to come. There will be two groups of transactions - group A will add the new gauges to the system and be executed immediately. Group B will kill the gauges for the existing pools and will be executed approximately on March 7th. This is to allow time for the next Aura voting cycle to complete to ensure any protocols providing voting incentives get the full value of those incentives. Notably we will only be killing gauges on Ethereum pools in this wave.

#### These gauges are being killed due to a lack of usage 
wstETH/LDO (Arbitrum)
wstETH/COMP
TEMPLE/DAI

We will be coordinating with the various bribe marketplaces to ensure all future voting incentives only go towards the new gauges. All of the migrated pools will be restored as “core pools” under BIP-19.

*Note: pools containing bbaUSD will transition to using bbeUSD instead (Boosted Euler USD). This is because we are waiting for Aave v3 static aToken wrappers to deploy bbaUSD using Aave v3*

title: [ARFC] Add fUSDC to Ethereum v3
author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative
created: 2023-05-23
---

## Summary

This ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add fUSDC to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Abstract

fUSDC is a yield-bearing token representing USDC deposits in Flux, a fork of Compound V2. Adding fUSDC to Ethereum v3 would allow fUSDC holders to borrow stablecoins on Aave and leverage their fUSDC position, boosting the stablecoin utilization rate on Aave, while attracting new stablecoin deposits thanks to boosted supply rates.

## Motivation

fUSDC is a new financial primitive with arguably the best risk-adjusted yield available in DeFi. Adding support for fUSDC on Ethereum V3 in isolated mode would allow fUSDC holders to borrow stablecoins on Aave and leverage their fUSDC position, boosting the stablecoin utilization rate on Aave, while attracting new stablecoin deposits thanks to boosted supply rates.

## Specification

Ticker: fUSDC

Contract Address: `[0x465a5a630482f3abd6d3b84b39b29b07214d19e5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x465a5a630482f3abd6d3b84b39b29b07214d19e5)`

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Isolation Mode | Yes |
| Borrowable | No |
| Collateral Enabled | Yes |
| Supply Cap | 220M (~$4.45M) |
| Borrow Cap | N/A |
| Debt Ceiling | $1M |
| LTV | 77% |
| LT | 79% |
| Liquidation Bonus | 4.5% |
| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 20% |
| Variable Base | 0.00% |
| Variable Slope1 | 4.00% |
| Variable Slope2 | 60.00% |
| Uoptimal | 90.00% |
| Reserve Factor | 10.00% |
| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |

## Next Steps

- If the ARFC snapshot vote passes, move the proposal to the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) stage for final approval and implementation.

16,"Cake is inflationary and therefore always becoming worth LESS

Cake is losing its grip on the market as many BSC coins have no real world purpose.

(Seriously, is there a single BSC coin that isn't a rug-pull?)

Perhaps PCS could become cross-chain to gain more traction? 

I propose that Cake should be burned at a rate higher than it is minted to protect the TVL.

17,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across four (4) Aave V3 Ethereum assets.

## Motivation

Chaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. 

Please find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).

*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*

You can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Ethereum/recommendations).

The output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to optimize parameters for DAI, wstETH, rETH and cbETH on V3 Ethereum, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a negligible effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)

In addition, for wstETH, rETH, and cbETH, we recommend adjusting the LTV, as the current spread between the LTV to LT for these assets, which were originally set for the conservative V3 Ethereum launch, is unjustifiably large. The new spread will be similar to that of WETH.

**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$2.5M, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**

### Liquidity Analysis:

Based on our analysis, we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support any significant liquidations with the updated parameters.

### Positions Analysis

We have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations.

### Recommendations

| Asset | Parameter | Current | Rec| Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DAI | Liquidation Penalty | 4% | 5% | +1% |
| WSTETH | Liquidation Threshold | 80% | 81% | +1% |
| WSTETH | Loan-to-Value | 69% | 78.5% | +9.5% |
| cbETH | Liquidation Threshold | 74% | 77% | +3% |
| cbETH | Loan-to-Value | 67% | 74.5% | +7.5% |
| rETH | Liquidation Threshold | 74% | 77% | +3% |
| rETH | Loan-to-Value | 67% | 74.5% | +7.5% |",neutral
18,"# Introduction

veBAL holders get a boost in the liquidity mining program compared to LPs who don't hold veBAL. These boosts can be delegated to third parties, but this system has barely had any use.

This proposal aims to upgrade the boost delegation subsystem to make it compatible with other platforms, such as [Paladin's](https://paladin.vote/) boost market.

# Specification

The boost system currently in use is Curve's first attempt to build such a system, and is unnecessarily complicated. It implements boosts as ERC721 NFTs, which makes the code very complex due to having to deal with enumeration and other features, and doesn't enable any useful use cases.

The new `VeBoostV2` contract was also developed by Curve, and they've been using it for the past couple months. It is much simpler than the previous iteration, and enables multiple integrations. We've also extended it to support [EIP 1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271), so that contract accounts can use it to delegate boosts (and prevent [issues like the one Tribe DAO encountered](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-5-tribe-dao-unclaimable-bal-rewards/3196)).

## Execution Details

Call `setDelegation` on the `VotingEscrowDelegationProxy` (`0x6f5a2eE11E7a772AeB5114A20d0D7c0ff61EB8A0`) (address found [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220325-ve-delegation/output/mainnet.json#L3)) with the following arguments:
 - `delegation`: `0x67F8DF125B796B05895a6dc8Ecf944b9556ecb0B`

The `delegation` parameter is the new boost system: it's address can be found [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20221205-veboost-v2/output/mainnet.json#L2).

Doing this requires the permission to call `setDelegation`, which is `0xac0fcdc4520d7bde1c58bbefd7c8dd39aaf382a20c27991134c14fe63d2c96f3` (see [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json#L454)). This permission is currently held by the Governance DAO Multisig (`0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`), so it doesn't need to be granted.

# Migration

Anyone can migrate any boost from the old system to the new one by calling `migrate` or `migrate_many` on the `VeBoostV2` contract (`0x67F8DF125B796B05895a6dc8Ecf944b9556ecb0B`). I've already done this for all currently existing boosts in [this transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x84496dc95a49c42aba9cfcc0c1e9269512ec141c66df9662198f0ff86fbf06df). 

If any boosts are created between now and the time in which the migration is completed, they can be permissionlessly migrated via that mechanism.

# Risk

The [VeBoostV2](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/daa4fafcb1025a333b98944d4887e730354a951d/pkg/liquidity-mining/contracts/VeBoostV2.vy) contract was originally developed by Curve [and is currently in use by them](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd0921691c7debc698e6e372c6f74dc01fc9d3778#code), since [July 19th, 2022](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2427765302e933e209805936877f5efe9f918d61bd7403052ef4923f8285ed78). It has only received trivial modifications by the Balancer Labs team (e.g. to make the `permit()` function simpler to use), so it should be as safe as the original one.

If any issues were to arise with the boost system, the most harm that could be done would be to set large boosts for some accounts and no boosts for others - but boosts are capped to 2.5x at the gauges. Then, the emergency subDAO would step in and call `killDelegation`, removing the boost system entirely until a fix was implemented.",neutral

We have already had a great interest in these collaborations, so this proposal would allow us to capitalize on these opportunities.

Brand Visibility: As part of the sponsorship agreement, ApeCoin will be prominently featured on official banners and other event marketing materials. This includes the ApeCoin logo on the monthly event poster, displayed across various platforms, ensuring significant brand visibility. Additionally, three banners provided by the sponsor will be strategically placed throughout the event to maximize exposure. These banners may include QR codes to direct attendees to more information about ApeCoin and its ecosystem.

Website Affiliation: ApeCoin will be featured on the First Friday website with a hyperlink, facilitating easy access for event-goers interested in learning more about ApeCoin, its values, and its projects. This online presence will be complemented by a dedicated social media post on one of First Friday’s platforms each month, further enhancing ApeCoin’s visibility.

Media and Press Engagement: The sponsorship ensures ApeCoin a mention in First Friday’s press releases each month, amplifying our reach beyond the physical event to the broader public and media outlets. The presence of ApeCoin in Las Vegas will be difficult to overlook.

Photos and Videos: Leverage high-tier local production companies to capture professional-grade photos and videos of ApeCoin’s presence and activities during First Friday events. This content will be utilized to further boost ApeCoin’s marketing and community engagement efforts across all digital platforms, showcasing the vibrant interaction between ApeCoin, artists, and attendees.

Marketing Materials to Give Away: Produce and distribute a range of high-quality, visually appealing marketing materials such as brochures, flyers, posters, and ApeCoin-themed merchandise. These items will not only serve as a tangible reminder of the ApeCoin experience at First Friday but also as educational tools to foster a deeper understanding and interest in ApeCoin and the broader Web3 ecosystem.

Educational Materials and Workshops: Develop and offer comprehensive educational materials, including an educational video and printed resources curated with insights from ApeCoin experts. Host workshops and interactive sessions during the First Friday events to educate attendees on ApeCoin, blockchain technology, and the importance of digital currencies in the arts and beyond. These initiatives are designed to demystify ApeCoin for newcomers and enrich the understanding of existing enthusiasts.

Ability to Host Events Year-Round: Beyond the monthly First Friday events, leverage the partnership to host additional events, showcases, and activations throughout 2024. These events will not only maintain the momentum and engagement generated during First Friday but also strengthen ApeCoin’s ongoing relationship with the local community, artists, and city officials. Through year-round events, ApeCoin will solidify its presence and influence within the Las Vegas arts and cultural scene.

By aligning with First Friday, ApeCoin establishes a significant presence within the Las Vegas art community and pioneers the integration of digital innovation into cultural events.

21,"We are Pancake Swap community; it is time for us to show our true power as a community. It seems that if about 10 million more Cakes are burned per month (2.5 million per week), the Cake inflation rate will reach zero or even negative. My suggestion for this is to create a Burning pool that burns the voluntary deposits of the Cake holders on this pool on a weekly basis. For example, if 1 million wallets burn 2 Cakes a week, this goal can be easily achieved. The question that arises is why people should do such a thing. Interesting mechanisms can be offered to encourage people to deposit in this pool.

Reward mechanism:

1- As an Example, At least 10% of all Syrup pool tokens (except Cake) can be allocated to be mined by people who are deposited on this pool (in proportion to the number of cakes they deposited to be burnt on the Pool).

2- Rare NFTs can be awarded as a reward to those who participated in the Burning pool in proportion to their participation and in the form of a lottery on a weekly basis. These NFTs can also be practical, that is, they can offer special privileges to their owners. If the plan is approved, I can provide more details about these NFTs.
 In addition, for the instance, 5% of the collection of NFTs that each artist offers for sale on the second phase of the Pancake Swap’s NFT Market can be allocated to this pool.
 
3- Holding a Cake burning competition so that the first to one hundred on the leaderboard can get special permission to participate in the next IFO. For example, they can be dedicatedly allowed to buy 5% of the next IFO in proportion to their rank.


4- A specefic amount of IDO can be dedicated to participant of this pool as airdrop.

5- Redirect specific percent of Cake injecting to lottary to this pool as Airdrop.

And so on.

Conclusion:

This, along with other Cake-burning mechanisms, can cause not only the APY not to decrease, but even increase if the growth of the cake gets negative.

A brief description of the Burning pool:
I consider this pool to be a one-sided, means, we can only stake. It will be a pool where anyone can stake as much as they want and can specify how much of cake be burnt weekly (on the time of staking). Alex, for instance, wants to contribute 21 Cake to the Burning pool, he specifies 3 Cakes burn at time of staking (means he participated in this pool for 7 weeks and benefits from its incentives during this period). He, also, does not have to add cake to the Burning pool every week which helps him to have consistent profit. (note weekly staking also possible)

And the last thing is all the fees related to staking Cakes in this Pool will be spent on buying back Cakes from market and burning it.

#### Tl;dr

Taking into account the current market environment, and to better serve the smaller projects that join us for farm auctions, we are proposing the following changes for the upcoming #31 farm auctions, on **September 29 2022:**

* Frequency of farm auctions: 2 weeks > **3 weeks** 
* Minimum bidding of CAKE: 5,000 CAKE > **7,000 CAKE**
* Winning farms: 1x multiplier from 7 days > **10 days**
* Number of winners: **3** (No change)
* Bidding time: **1 hour** (No change)


#### Proposal for longer community Farm Rewards

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce some changes to the farm auctions’ parameters, and would like to seek your support. Read on to find out more!

#### What are Farm Auctions?

Farm Auctions are a **cost-efficient** way of boosting projects’ volume and attracting organic traffic/users. Not only will this bootstrap and bring **immediate liquidity** for project tokens, it also means that liquidity providers can farm CAKE at a **high APY**!

#### What are the key parameters changes?

* Frequency of farm auctions: 2 weeks > **3 weeks** 
* Minimum bidding of CAKE: 5,000 CAKE > **7,000 CAKE**
* Winning farms: 1x multiplier from 7 days > **10 days**
* Number of winner: **3** (No change)
* Bidding time: **1 hour** (No change)

#### Why change?

Firstly, a longer farm benefits everyone. A **10 days 1x farm** would be more attractive to projects as well as you. On one hand, winning projects will have a 10 days farm, 3 days longer than the usual 7 days farm, this will allow them to have **greater exposure** and “air time” to our **huge community**. You will also be able to stake LP in the winners’ farms for 3 days longer, and take the extra time to learn about the projects while earning yummy CAKE tokens.

Secondly, more time between farm auctions enables projects to fully utilize the Farms won through farm auctions, such as planning **more detailed marketing** and/or **product roadmaps**. The change in farm auction frequency is in line with the longer farm duration, and setting farm auctions to happen once every 3 weeks means projects have more time to come up with a **bidding strategy** and maximize their benefit from the farm auctions

Thirdly, the extra time between farm auctions will allow PancakeSwap to consider a **wider group of projects**. This would make each farm auctions more exciting to participate in for projects, and more exciting for you to witness, and give up-and-coming projects a chance to win a farm to boost their liquidity and volume- this will in turn benefit the entire BNB ecosystem.


#### What is the process of farm auctions?
![](https://i.imgur.com/pjUwxz1.png)
 
#### How do project teams win the auctions?

Farm auctions will be held once every 3 weeks, we will provide **THREE** 1x CAKE multiplier farms, lasting for a longer period of 10 days** for projects to bid on. Project teams simply bid enough CAKE to be in the top three projects by the end of the auctions to win a 1x CAKE multiplier farm for their token! The CAKE tokens contributed by the three winning projects will be taken as payment and burned in the next CAKE burn.

If project teams do not end up contributing enough CAKE to be in the top three projects, they will be able to claim their CAKE back and try again in the next farm auctions.

We will try and get back to projects on their application as soon as possible. If projects have any queries, they can reach out to @PancakeSwapBD on Telegram.",neutral

26,"## Summary

This proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard USDP in isolation mode to the Ethereum Aave V3 Market.

## Motivation

As part of the community efforts on the V2 to V3 migration, Chaos Labs proposed a [multi-phased plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636) to promote V3 adoption. As per this plan, Chaos Labs proposes to list USDP on Aave V3 on Ethereum. USDP is currently listed on V2 Ethereum as a non-collateral asset.

### Liquidity and Market Cap

When analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at data from the past 180 days. The average market cap of USDP over the past 180 days was ~$883M, and the average daily trading volume was ~$8.7M (CeFi & DeFi). 

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreicffv66o5w2u2l6vdu6u2mfdobf4dgnla2k42osux3s7pycwyuj6m)
    

### **Liquidation Threshold**

Analyzing USDP price volatility over the past, we observed daily annualized volatility of 2.79% and 30-day annualized volatility of 1.63%. Considering this volatility and the history of USDP on other networks, we recommend an initial LT of 75%.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreifydbyneeuh24uqgfmss6u3ppuyqevx6eyau44dpmgfurrtoj4h6a)
    

We recommend listing USDP as borrowable, as we do not observe a significant risk to the protocol by allowing to borrow of USDP, as long as it is bound by a well-defined cap.

### **Debt Ceiling**

Following [Chaos Labs’ Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440), we recommend an initial debt ceiling of $3.3M. Under the methodology for Isolation Mode, we consider two levels of probabilities for extreme price drops - Medium-High and High. We estimate the probability of an extreme price drop for USDP as Medium-High. Given this debt ceiling, we do not identify a profitable attack vector under the current liquidity levels.

### **Supply Cap, Borrow Cap, and Liquidation Bonus**

When evaluating the initial supply caps for migrated assets from Aave V2 Market, we carefully analyze the latest supply for the asset and consider it as the demand for supplying the asset. We then ensure that this amount is aligned with the current liquidity on-chain. 

Furthermore, we take into account the debt ceiling calculated using our methodology and derive a supply cap that aligns with the debt ceiling. This approach is aimed at minimizing the risks associated with listing assets while ensuring that the supply cap is aligned with the overall liquidity of the platform and the potential risks that the asset might pose to the protocol.

Accordingly, We recommend a supply cap of 5M USDP and a borrow cap of 4M USDP.

30,"## Background:

On Ethereum, Uniswap Labs governance consists of a suite of smart contracts. However, in addition to its original deployment on Ethereum L1 mainnet, Uniswap contracts are also deployed on four additional domains - Polygon, Optimism, Celo, and Arbitrum.

Uniswap deployments on these domains do not have native access to the on-chain governance system, nor the UNI tokens which grant voting power in this system on Ethereum mainnet; in order for the existing Uniswap governance system to execute proposals governing these deployments, there must be some method of passing governance decisions from Ethereum mainnet to other domains.

Presently, this method has been implemented differently for each of the four chains. The system governing Optimism and Polygon follow similar design principles, and should be functional for passing proposals.

***The system governing the Arbitrum deployment was mis-configured due to a mis-communication between developers, and will require more involved intervention to repair.***

## Problem:

Arbitrum was initially going to allow L1 addresses to pass calls directly to L2 with msg.sender preserved. After realizing security issues with this approach, Arbitrum team instead shifted their approach to use aliasing (this method transforms L1 addresses to be a different address when represented on an L2):

Uniswap Labs was not made aware of this change in approach before deploying on Arbitrum. The Uniswap Factory was deployed with the owner set to the same, unaliased address of the L1 Uniswap Timelock contract.
To verify, see: owner address [Address 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc | Arbiscan ](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc) set at [UniswapV3Factory | Address 0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984 | Arbiscan ](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984#readContract)
This address on Arbitrum is an EOA (not a contract) which nobody has the private key to control
The governance deployer key on Arbitrum has burned the nonce that could deploy a contract to this address, verifiable here: [Address 0x41653c7d61609d856f29355e404f310ec4142cfb | Arbiscan ](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x41653c7d61609d856f29355e404f310ec4142cfb)
Therefore, nobody can execute governance proposals on Arbitrum in the current state

## Solution:

To fix the cross chain messaging bridge, Arbitrum proposes the following:

1. Final governance vote kicks off (after Temperature and Consensus checks pass).
2. Before the vote passes, Arbitrum will add a temporary exception to disable address-aliasing for messages from the L1 TimeLock contract, 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc. Arbitrum will notify the Uniswap community via the Uniswap governance forum once this is done.
3. Once the final on-chain governance vote passes, the Uniswap governance contract will send a cross-chain message from the L1 Timelock contract to call setOwner on the L2 Uniswap factory, setting the owner to the L1 Timelock’s address alias, 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD.

* This is the L1 Timelock address + the alias offset: 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc + 0x111
1000000000000000000000000000000001111 as described further at [L1 To L2 Messaging | Arbitrum Documentation Center ](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing)

4. We will be able to see when this is completed on-chain. Arbitrum will re-enable aliasing for the L1 Timelock contract address. Once this is complete, cross-chain governance between Uniswap and Arbitrum will be fully functional.

## Conclusion

Uniswap is currently the leading decentralized exchange by TVL on Arbitrum, and if this proposal passes the temperature check and continues along the governance process, it will strengthen the current relationship between the two projects.",bullish

36,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to update four (4) risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold (LT), Loan-To-Value (LTV), Liquidation Bonus (LB), and UOptimal for FEI on Aave V2 Ethereum.

## Motivation

As part of the ongoing risk mitigation strategies implemented for V2 Ethereum, this proposal suggests another series of risk parameter updates to minimize potential exposure to FEI. As a reminder, FEI has been frozen since [September 2022](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/96/), with the RF set at 99%.

Over the past months, we have witnessed a significant drop in market cap, and together with the recent price fluctuations, we recommend decreasing Aave’s FEI exposure to a minimum.

The recommended measures include the following:

1. Lowering LT and LTV to zero  - This will prevent new borrowings against FEI and potentially further protocol losses should FEI's price fluctuate due to limited liquidity.
  1. By reducing the LT to zero, two additional accounts will become eligible for liquidation, totaling a value of $1,051. The main account to be liquidated can be found [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/wallets/0xa41f03dd427100284ecaa24734b00abc037557c0)
2. Raising the LB from 6.5% to 10% to provide a stronger incentive for liquidators to address underwater positions.
3. Decreasing the UOptimal from 80% to 1% to increase the borrowing rate and encourage borrowers to repay their loans.

## Specification

|Asset|Parameter|Current|Recommendation|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|FEI|LT|75%|1%*|
|FEI|LTV|65%|0|
|FEI|LB|6.5%|10%|
|FEI|UOptimal|80%|1%|

**For technical reasons related to V2 we will set the LT 1% rather than at 0*

## Next Steps

1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.
2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.

37,"We would like to address an important matter regarding the Fixed Staking Contract and propose an early withdrawal option due to significant changes in tokenomics that have greatly impacted the APY of the contract.

We understand that these changes were implemented to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project, and we appreciate the efforts made by the team in this regard. However, it has come to our attention that many community members were not aware of these changes at the time of staking. As a result, they find themselves in a situation where they are compelled to continue with their fixed staking despite the altered parameters.

We acknowledge that the decision to stake tokens was largely based on the expected APY, and the subsequent reduction in APY due to the recent changes does not seem fair to those who participated in the fixed staking. It is crucial to maintain transparency and ensure that community members have accurate information before making such important decisions.

Therefore, we would like to propose the introduction of an early withdrawal option for those who wish to exit the fixed staking contract due to the significant changes in tokenomics. This option would allow affected individuals to reconsider their staking decisions in light of the altered parameters and make adjustments accordingly.

We believe that by offering this early withdrawal option, we can uphold the principles of fairness and empower community members to make choices that align with their expectations. We also understand that the recent changes were made for the long-term sustainability of the project, and we fully support this objective. However, it is important to ensure that the staking process remains transparent and that participants are given the opportunity to adjust their positions based on updated information.

We kindly request the Pancake Community and project team to consider this proposal and engage in a constructive discussion to find a suitable resolution. We believe that by addressing this matter, we can foster a stronger sense of trust and collaboration within our community.

39,"**Motivation**

Optimism is proposing to deploy Aave V3 onto Optimism to bring one of DeFi’s most trusted lending protocols to the future of Ethereum. We want to support users who seek to earn interest and take out loans using Aave while avoiding Ethereum’s high fees. 

**Specifications**

Optimism is a Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup network designed to utilize the strong security guarantees of Ethereum while reducing its cost and latency. Optimism is EVM equivalent, making the transition from L1 to L2 as seamless as possible. This means one-click deployments and full compatibility with most of the tooling Ethereum developers are accustomed to. It also means that with very few exceptions, existing Solidity smart contracts can run on Optimism exactly how they run on Ethereum. You can read more about EVM Equilvance here:

41,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas/1437). If approved, changes would take effect at **00:00 UTC on Monday, March 8**.

On behalf of the Balancer community, I’d like to propose significant modifications to the ongoing gas reimbursement campaign. We have heard some concerns that the campaign is confusing and that it isn’t clear how much BAL a user will receive for a given trade. During these times of network congestion and high gas costs, we want to provide everyone with an opportunity to trade on Balancer. With that in mind, it doesn’t seem fair to ask users to exercise blind faith and wait until “next Wednesday” to find out what they’ve earned from trading. We would like to make every effort to simplify the campaign and improve transparency; what you see is what you get, or at least as close as possible. We plan to accomplish this by removing various sources of uncertainty from the reimbursement calculations so that it is possible to get an estimate ahead of time and display it to the user at the time of trade submission.

# The Proposal
Allocate **30,000 BAL** from the Ecosystem Fund to the “BAL for Gas'' campaign. There is no fixed time period; the budget is consumed on a **first-come, first-served** basis. When the budget is exhausted, the campaign is suspended until it is replenished by BAL governance.

For **each eligible trade made through the Balancer Exchange Proxy**, award claimable BAL tokens to the trader. An eligible trade is a trade containing one or more eligible swaps, where an eligible swap is a **swap between any two tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json)**. Claims are made available at the [BAL claims interface](https://claim.balancer.finance/#/) on Wednesday (UTC time) following the close of the weekly period (00:00 UTC Monday - 23:59 UTC Sunday) in which the trade occurred.

The amount of gas to be reimbursed is predetermined by the number of eligible swaps within the transaction:

![table|690x185](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/dd83c24ba43bd36e91396a5b6296f4c92cc986c2.png)

For converting gas to BAL, use the **median gas price of the enclosing block** and the **BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko** closest to the block time.

# Motivation
The proposal above may seem familiar, but there are some very important distinctions between this and the previous reimbursement program. All modifications share the common goal of improving user experience, which we believe is a matter of simplification and transparency.

First, this proposed campaign makes no effort to account for the _actual_ expenses of the user. Both the amount of gas consumed by the transaction and the gas price ultimately paid are irrelevant. Instead, deterministic figures are favored: the amount of gas is fixed depending on the number of swaps, and the gas price is the block median, rather than the user’s own price. It is simply too difficult to accurately predict the parameters of a given transaction ahead of time, whereas it is much easier to predict block-wide parameters. Predictability informs transparency.

The second major shift pertains to the budget. The existing program allocates a fixed weekly budget, which can sometimes necessitate cuts to the reimbursements in order to avoid excess spending. Such cuts can only be known _after_ the weekly period has ended, and therefore the existence of a weekly budget renders any trade-time estimates useless. In contrast, here we propose a fixed total budget which is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. This allows us to add reimbursement estimates to the Exchange UI at the time of the trade. If there are still funds remaining in the budget, the user will see an estimate of the amount of BAL to be awarded; and if the budget is exhausted, then the user will simply be informed as such and the estimate will be zero. When the well runs dry, BAL governors can decide whether to replenish and continue the campaign.

Third, the BAL/ETH price model is modified. Whereas the ongoing campaign uses the median price for the whole weekly period, the proposed campaign uses the price as close as possible to the actual block time. Knowing the approximate price at the time of the trade allows us to make informed estimates about the amount of BAL to be awarded.

![image|690x120](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/e00a59183e29b37e29369999caccc6035028b810.png)

Finally, the fixed amounts of gas (130k, 220k, 300k, 400k) were chosen so that only 1% of all trades, on average, would be overcompensated. This should be sufficient to prevent gaming the system for profit, but nonetheless **we reserve the right to filter out suspicious activity**. The Balancer Exchange UI will never perform more than four swaps in a single trade, which is why only four numbers are provided; any transactions containing 5+ swaps must belong to bots, whereas the target audience is end users. We simply cap the reimbursement amount at 400,000 gas; any additional eligible swaps beyond the first four will yield no further benefit.

# Mechanics
Although every effort is made to be as transparent and accurate as possible, there is still a very small amount of room for error. Here we will detail how the BAL amounts are computed both at trade time (estimated) and at dispersal time (actual).

At the time of the trade:

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **estimated** gas price for display purposes is the median from the last few blocks according to the `getGasPrice()` function from the web3 provider. This should provide a good corollary to the median of the actual trade block, which cannot be known in advance.
4. The **estimated** BAL/ETH price for display purposes is queried from the large [80/20 BAL/WETH pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x59a19d8c652fa0284f44113d0ff9aba70bd46fb4/). This acts as a real-time oracle which isn’t worth manipulating because it is only used to display an estimate and not to compute an actual award amount.
5. The user will see, in one summary number, the final result of #1-4: the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for this particular trade, assuming there are still funds left in the budget. A USD estimate is also provided for completeness, with the BAL/USD price being queried from CoinGecko’s API.

The UI changes are still being finalized, but as a mockup consider the image below.

![image2|485x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/1174949f6ce920677d9102bbf6ee0a35627776b8.png)

At dispersal time (computed by the [open source mining scripts](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts)):

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **actual** gas price is the median from the block containing the trade. We will filter out artificially low-price transactions which are sometimes included by miners and can skew the median - these are typically 0-gwei or 1-gwei transactions.
4. The **actual** BAL/ETH price is queried from the CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

It should be clear that the only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are most likely quite small: the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block, and the 80/20 BAL/WETH price may not perfectly match CoinGecko’s BAL/ETH price. All in all, the user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time, and this improved user experience should bring more traders to the campaign.

**TL:DR**

As outlined in the [new whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the MKR capFactor from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). MKR has exceeded $10m adjusted liquidity for a period of time. MKR bring good liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem.

---

**The Proposal**

This is a proposal to increase the MKR cap Tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). MKR currently has $16M in adjusted liquidity and has probably surpassed it's $10M cap for a month.

MKR brings useful liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem. Before, Uniswap used to be the most popular DEX for trading MKR.

---

**What is MKR?**

MKR is a DeFi large cap, it currently has a $600M market cap. There's currently $1.5B locked in MakerDAO, and 425M DAI has been minted.

SCD (Single Collateral DAI) was launched in December 2017. MCD (Multi Collateral DAI) was launched in November 2019.

MakerDAO is a decentralized credit platform on Ethereum that supports DAI, a stablecoin whose value is pegged to USD. Anyone can use Maker to open a Vault, lock in collateral such as ETH, BAT, or WBTC ... and generate Dai as debt against that collateral. Dai debt incurs a stability fee (i.e., continuously accruing interest), which is paid upon repayment of borrowed Dai. DAI is collected as system surplus, and then used in FLAP auctions to burn MKR.

MKR can also be used as a governance token to govern the system. MKR holders also act as the last line of defense in case of a black swan event. If system-wide collateral value falls too low too fast, MKR is minted and sold on the open market to raise more collateral, diluting MKR holders.

### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard CDCETH to Aave V3 on Ethereum
### Author: Jlok & ACI
###  Date: 2024-07-15

---
### Summary:

This proposal is to explore community interest in adding [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH CDCETH) to Aave V3 on the Ethereum mainnet. CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.

### Motivation

[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet. As of June 2024, [Crypto.com (http://crypto.com/) has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.

[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform. 

To enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) introduced a Liquid Staking Token (LST) - [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).

Currently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues. 

Other liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers. 

The liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.

Integrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded.

Confidential banners/listings on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.
Onboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH & Aave adoption & increased revenues for both parties.

### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments

 [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.

Integration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.

Following sUSD’s depeg, after which [the market was frozen on V3 Optimism](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719/13), we provide an update and recommend future actions.

# Motivation

sUSD depegged on May 16, 2024, with its price reaching a low of 0.915 relative to USDC. As it was depegging, we provided a full analysis of the cause and a recommendation to freeze its Optimism market; sUSD has since repegged.  

### Market Response to Freezing

Following the market being frozen on May 16, we observed gradual withdrawals over the next four days, with about 1M sUSD withdrawn. However, starting May 20, withdrawals accelerated, and there are currently 5.16M sUSD deposited in the market.

On the other hand, the sUSD borrowed has been relatively stable, decreasing from 4.3M sUSD at the time of the freeze to 4.17M sUSD now. This is despite sUSD remaining depegged until May 21, incentivizing users who borrowed the asset to repay their debt. 

Synthetix has also [announced](https://blog.synthetix.io/transitioning-to-synthetix-v3-scaling-susd-migrating-snx/) its transition plan for V3, which details how it will scale sUSD. These updates include expanding the collateral assets for sUSD from SNX alone to SNX, ETH, USDC, and other yield-generating collateral and governance-approved tokens. Additionally, the protocol has incentivized sUSD liquidity providers on Velodrome (Optimism; 10,000 OP tokens per week in the sUSD/USDC pool) and Curve (Ethereum; 20,000 SNX tokens per week in the sUSD/USDC/DAI/USDT pool); liquidity has begun to improve as a result of these incentives.

### sUSD Exposure on Aave

sUSD is listed on Aave V3 Optimism as a frozen collateral asset and Aave V2 Ethereum as a frozen, non-collateral asset. Since the freeze on Optimism, we have observed a sharp decrease in value borrowed against sUSD, as well as the amount borrowed against sUSD in E-Mode. The reduction in E-Mode borrowed against is especially important, given the high LT afforded in this market.§

# Recommendations

- **Reduce Supply and Borrow Caps on Aave V3, Optimism:** Given that the market’s size has decreased, as well as a decrease in on-chain supply — from 31M pre-freeze to 23.6M now — we recommend decreasing the supply and borrow caps ahead of unfreezing the asset. This will ensure that any future growth in the market is controlled and risk is minimized.
    - We recommend setting the caps according to our initial listing methodology, in which we determine the amount of an asset that can be liquidated with slippage lower than the LB, set at 1% in the stablecoin E-mode, and recommend the supply cap be double that amount. This leads us to a recommendation of a 7M sUSD supply cap and a borrow cap set at 80% of the supply cap at 5.6M sUSD.

- **Reduce Stablecoin E-Mode LT and LTV:** We recommend reducing E-Mode LT and LTV for stablecoins in Optimism’s Stablecoin E-Mode. Reducing LTs will make the protocol more resilient to any potential depegs in the future, ensuring that there is larger buffer in the event a stablecoin’s price falls and liquidations occur. Additionally, lowering LTV will slightly reduce users’ stablecoin-stablecoin borrowing power, again reducing risk in these markets.
    - A 2% LT reduction on the Optimism V3 stablecoin E-mode category will make 18 accounts eligible for liquidation, potentially inducing $25K in new liquidations.
- **Adjust sUSD’s LTV and LT:** Following the freeze of sUSD, its non-E-Mode LTV was dropped to 0%. Its current LT is 75%. Increasing the LTV will allow users to borrow non-stablecoin assets against their collateral, while adjusting the LT downwards will ensure the protocol has a larger buffer in the event of liquidations, whether from a depeg or from appreciation of borrowed assets.
    - We recommend increasing sUSD’s non-E-Mode LTV to 60% and reducing its non-E-Mode LT to 70%. At this time, this would lead to a negligible $8 in liquidation across 4 accounts.

- **Unfreeze the sUSD market on** **Optimism:** While sUSD has repegged, we note that the ongoing [deprecation](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719/7?) of synth assets may continue to cause peg volatility. The discount rate, which dictates the value synth asset holders can receive when they redeem, will continue to be lowered in an effort to deprecate these markets. Synth asset holders may request a redemption at parity, which, in the future, may carry some time-based conditions (i.e., sUSD is sent to the redeeming user over the course of weeks or months) to reduce the potential impact on sUSD’s peg. While the Synthetix Council has an incentive to ensure redemptions of synth assets with minimal price impacts, whether to the synth assets or sUSD, these time-based conditions are not codified.
    - Given this, as well as the reduced supply/borrow caps and E-Mode LT/LTV, we recommend unfreezing the market.

**We would like to thank @kaleb and the Synthetix team for their collaboration, insights on the situation, and guidance on the protocol and governance mechanisms to stabilize the peg.**

Title: [ARFC] Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum
Date: 2024-05-13
Author: Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)
---

## Summary

The proposal aims to onboard Threshold Network’s tBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum. tBTC is backed one-to-one with Bitcoin.

## Motivation/Background:

tBTC is Threshold’s decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum’s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.

Having recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).

tBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.

Threshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.

### Benefits for Aave:

- Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.
- A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.
- Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.
- Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.
- Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium’s LTIPP.

### Emission schedule

tBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.

### Risks

For tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - [Wallet Generation  Threshold Docs](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation)

The Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:

#### PancakeSwap and Token Supply

The state of DeFi and PancakeSwap has changed immensely since our inception in September 2020, and we propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750,000,000 (750M) to better reflect our long-term outlook on PancakeSwap and the $CAKE token.

#### Current PancakeSwap Tokenomics

In the kitchen, we have been working hard to bring value to PancakeSwap and the $CAKE token, from providing new products (e.g. Perpetuals), to sourcing the tastiest Syrup Pools and Farms. Unique amongst AMMs, we also burn transaction fees from platform activities (e.g. trading, prediction, farm auctions) to further increase the scarcity of the $CAKE token.

**But we can do better, and we will.**

#### Proposed Cap on CAKE Maximum Token Supply

We propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M $CAKE. Based on our calculations – which can be found in detail in our [**litepaper v2**](https://v2litepaper.pancakeswap.finance/) – this comfortably gives us an approximate runway of 3 years, before the current circulating supply reaches this cap. 

We believe that implementing this proposed cap will enable the $CAKE token to better reflect the value, community, and sustainability of PancakeSwap.

#### What’s next?

If the community decides to approve the proposal to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M, we will formally incorporate it into our tokenomics, and institute the max token supply cap.

65,"## [ARFC]  Deploy a Lido Aave v3 Instance

## Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

## Date: 2024-06-24

---

## **Summary**

This proposal suggests joining the Lido Alliance as the Aave DAO and deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on the Lido ecosystem.

## **Motivation**

Aave and Lido have historically seen symbiotic growth, with stETH being one of the premier collaterals on Aave and leveraged staking being one of the most profitable use cases for both Aave DAO and Lido users.

Lido is in the process of launching the Lido Alliance, which will reward novel use cases of staked ETH and support further growth of the Lido ecosystem. This ARFC proposal suggests that Aave supports Lido Alliance efforts by deploying a new Aave V3 ETH market for Lido. This Aave v3 instance will be designed and tuned to support stETH leverage loopers. The deployment will only include wstETH and wETH assets with E-Mode enabled.

Lido has committed incentive programs and ecosystem support for this instance in order to bootstrap liquidity and promote additional programs within the Lido Alliance.

This market will be bootstrapped with wETH from the Ahab program to attract wETH liquidity.

wETH suppliers will also be proposed to be eligible to a dedicated Merit Boost

Incentives from Lido will be detailed ahead of the AIP deployment. 

## Specification

The Lido Alliance’s Aave v3 instance implements the following:

- The borrow cap of wETH will be set to 90% of supplied wETH, with updates tightly controlled by the risk steward. This will ensure that stETH/wETH loops are consistently profitable and can't go into negative territory.
- E-Mode LTV & LT are set 50 bps above all other Aave implementations, making it the most efficient loop venue in the industry.
- For the first 6 months of the Lido Alliance Aave v3, wETH slope1 will be set at 2.50%, ((currently 2.7% on mainnet and on L2s) and wETH RF set at 10% (currently 15% on all markets). This will make it the most profitable venue to loop stETH & wETH.
- wstETH RF will be 5%.

The deployment of the Aave V3 Lido Ecosystem Aave will be done by Catapulta on behalf of the Aave DAO.

67,"## Summary

This proposal is created on behalf of Blockchain at Michigan, and in partnership with [Proximity Labs](https://www.proximity.dev/). We propose to deploy Uniswap v3 on Aurora through an additional grant license and ask the Uniswap community to consider and discuss this proposal.

Uniswap will expand access to decentralized and permissionless trading of tokens on Aurora, and aligns with the community’s multichain vision to bring trustless liquidity to all chains and position itself as a de facto DeFi hub in the space.

Our proposal will include a $5m amount allocated for financial incentives to Uniswap users on Aurora and a commitment to actively engage with the Uniswap community to further support its growth through grant programs and funding for protocol-related development.

Proximity Labs will coordinate with the community and governance participants to distribute these funds and will support future developments and allocations to projects leveraging Uniswap and DeFi’s ecosystem participants on Aurora.

## About Aurora

[Aurora ](http://aurora.dev)is an EVM-compatible execution environment running on top of [NEAR](http://near.org), a proof-of-stake layer 1 chain, and takes advantage of its unique features, including sharding and developer gas fee remuneration. Our long-term vision is to provide a user-friendly platform for developers and users to build fast and highly-scalable decentralized applications offering seamless integrations with NEAR’s native chain as well as different L1s and L2 networks.

Transaction costs on Aurora are among the lowest while ensuring a high throughput, scalability, and security. Aurora's SputnikVM is a highly optimized EVM that can execute transactions at high speeds while maintaining full compatibility with Ethereum's VM. This makes Aurora the perfect platform for applications that require high transaction throughput without incurring high costs.

There are a total of 100 active NEAR nodes acting as Aurora Relayers. The transaction finality happens on NEAR when a new block is minted, right after it’s wrapped in a NEAR transaction and broadcasted to the nodes through one of the relayers. Since the launch of Aurora in May 2021, the average block time has hovered around 1 second, the chain boosts almost instant transaction finality at ~2 secs and a near-zero transaction cost of ~$0.02 on average per tx.

## Proposal

The Aurora ecosystem has been growing tremendously with very talented builders and founders joining our sides and leveraging Aurora’s exceptional low fees and fast-finality transactions. New integrations and exciting announcements from major protocols and DeFi players such as Curve, Lido,.. have made Aurora one of the fastest growing chains out in the space with an ever-growing number of new people joining and interacting with our dApps. Our network consists of a wide array of platforms, from decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and cross-chain bridges. Our flagship protocols include Bastion Protocol, a lending protocol with more than $340M worth of assets deposited; Trisolaris, a decentralized exchange which secures more than $230M in liquidity; and the Rainbow Bridge, [with over $900M in volume](https://app.uniwhales.io/near/bridge-tracker) bridged across NEAR, Aurora, and Ethereum.

[Aurora’s TVL](https://defillama.com/chain/Aurora) sits at $500M, with highs at around $2.64B, demonstrating an overall increasing engagement with our ecosystem and a tremendously growing base of native supporters. There are more than 2.5 mil unique addresses with around 200k new unique addresses per day and we count around 200k transactions daily.

### Uniswap on Aurora

Aurora has a long history of supporting cross-chain protocol deployment and has been eagerly assisting developers and founders all across various chains and spaces to expand and reach new communities and tap into new ecosystems...

Major DeFi protocols such as The Graph, Flux Protocol, and Gnosis have already deployed on Aurora, and other blue chips such as Chainlink and Curve have committed to launching soon. We’re aware Uniswap has deployed on major chains such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Celo, with successful proposals to deploy on Moonbeam and Gnosis Chain. Deploying Uniswap would be the next big step to take to add to the already-growing DeFi hub on Aurora and will undoubtedly position itself as a premier AMM, and a major liquidity hub for Near, offering a seamless trading experience and allowing defi users to take advantage of its concentrated liquidity mechanism.

This opportunity will allow Uniswap to gain more exposure within the NEAR community as it positions itself as a primary decentralized exchange hub as we’re headed towards a multi-chain economy, and will undoubtedly bring a massive stream of revenue for Liquidity Providers.

### Incentives

Our proposal comes with financial and non-financial incentives to promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation

We plan on offering $5m from our ecosystem growth fund to the Uniswap community in the form of Liquidity Mining incentives and Developer Grants to support DeFi applications leveraging Uniswap on Aurora and building on top of it:

* Commit up to $2.5M for a liquidity mining campaign targeting the top liquid pairs to support the overall adoption of Uniswap V3
* Allocate a $2.5M fund to support long-term protocol development by funding developers, designers, and community members building on top of Uniswap and driving Aurora’s growth.
* Promote and increase Uniswap’s visibility within our ecosystem and to new projects, as well as showcase in Aurora’s marketing campaigns and Near/Aurora hacker houses and hackathons.

### Rainbow Bridge

Rainbow Bridge is the official decentralized bridge for transferring tokens between Ethereum, NEAR and the Aurora networks. At a high level, Rainbow Bridge works through:

1. LiteNodes (a lightweight node implemented as a smart contract that stores block headers. One deployed on the Ethereum network, which stores NEAR block headers, and one deployed on NEAR which stores Ethereum block headers.)
2. Relayers (scripts running on virtual servers, that periodically read blocks from one blockchain, and communicate them to the LiteNode running on the other.)
3. Connectors (smart contracts responsible for all of the logic associated with the cross-chain management of a given asset type).

Proximity Labs and Aurora will build a connector following the community vote to make the bridge compatible with general messaging functionality. This connector will be deployed on both Ethereum and Near and will be responsible for transferring governance votes/messages between both chains. One of the advantages of Rainbow Bridge is its malleability. Any asset or data can be transferred across the Rainbow Bridge if relevant Connectors exist.

#### Bridge Security

* Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?
  * Yes, once the relevant connector will be deployed
* Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?
  * The bridge is secured by multi-sig. Security is provided by implementing light-clients of both networks on the counterpart network: Ethereum light client on NEAR and NEAR light client on Ethereum.
* Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is the security provided by another third-party entity?
  * Rainbow bridge leverages both chains’ security (Ethereum and Near) through the use of Provers on both chains: EthOnNearProver NEAR contract in Rust and NearOnEthProver Ethereum contract in Solidity to verify Ethereum events and Near contract execution results. On Near, trust relies that at no time, 2/3 of the validators stake are honest. Not only the bridge, but also all other applications on NEAR operate under this assumption.
* Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?
  * The rainbow bridge is based on trustless assumptions with no selected middleman to transfer messages or assets between chains. Because of this, anyone can interact with its smart contracts. When players with bad intentions submit bad information, it would be challenged by independent Watchdogs watching the Near blockchain. [Similar attacks on the Rainbow Bridge have been dismissed resulting in the loss of the hacker’s funds ](https://twitter.com/AlexAuroraDev/status/1561692371833667585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1561692371833667585%7Ctwgr%5E6740c1fdd2c41ab98ee269e3e593e69b3891d107%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F108015%2Fnears-rainbow-bridge-blocks-another-attack-costing-hackers-5-ethereum)
* What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?
  * The bridge requires having a watchdog service that monitors submitted NEAR headers and challenges any headers with invalid signatures. For added security, independent users can run several watchdog services. In the event one entity runs a majority of the watchdogs, fraudulent messages can be processed
* Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?
  * The code has been audited by ConsenSys and SigmaPrime. No critical vector attacks were identified.

### License Exemption

We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Proximity Labs and Aurora to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Aurora, a Layer2 EVM compatible blockchain, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Aurora by Proximity Labs or Aurora through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script 15](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script).” Proximity Labs or Aurora would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.

### Timeline

Following the vote on the proposal by the Uniswap community, our team will be ready to start working on the deployment of Uniswap V3 on Aurora.

We anticipate a few extra steps that will prelude the full deployment such as:

* Developing the general message connector on top of Rainbow Bridge
* Deploying Uniswap V3 smart contracts on Aurora

We expected the full deployment to take anywhere around 4-5 weeks.",neutral
68,"Summary 

The proposal to list weETH assets on Venus Protocol offers significant benefits to the Venus community, including the opportunity to add Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT) from ether.fi on ETH Mainnet. 

Users can stake their ETH, earn rewards, and enjoy additional benefits through restaking on EigenLayer. With approximately $2.7B in TVL already deposited into the ether.fi protocol, the addition of weETH to Venus can enhance asset diversity and liquidity on the platform.

By integrating weETH, Venus allows users to earn ether.fi
and EigenLayer points for future incentives, along with lending APY on their holdings. 

The proposed liquidity mining incentive offered by Ether.fi for weETH suppliers demonstrates a commitment to jumpstart the market on Venus and attract more users. This move positions Venus as a pioneer in capturing the restaking market, catering to the growing demand for LRTs and providing users with a wider range of opportunities. 

Overall, listing weETH on Venus Protocol aligns with the community's focus on decentralization, sustainability, and doing what is right for the Ethereum ecosystem. The proposal not only enhances asset diversity and liquidity but also strengthens the collaboration between Venus and ether.fi to drive innovation and value creation for users.",bullish

70,"#### ABSTRACT

After the vote against AIP-4&5, the community had meaningful discussions on the ApeCoin DAO forum and elsewhere. The essential feedback was that overall the framework was fine, but lacked the key element of caps.

This AIP proposes a staking system for ApeCoin and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT ecosystem: Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC). Staking participants will be able to stake ApeCoin and use the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem NFTs to receive ApeCoin from a preset pool over a set period of time.

#### PROPOSAL

*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",bullish
71,"After the initial amount of dedicated BADGER has been dispersed, and then after every year, this program would be reevaluated for how successful it has been. The main metric of success will be how much value has been returned to exploited Badgers measured in USD and BTC at current market prices and this will be used in comparison to the amount of assets lost on Dec 2nd, 2021 as measured in USD and BTC based on pricing at the block before the first exploit transaction.

When considering the restitution program finished, should the DAO use BTC or USD in considering the total value paid to victims relative to total value of non-recoverable assets on Dec 2nd 2021?

title: [TEMP CHECK] Safety Module - Create GHO/USDC E-CLP Category
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
created: 2024-05-13

---

# Summary

This publication proposes creating a new Safety Module (SM) category for the GHO/USDC E-CLP by Gyroscope built on Balancer v2.

# Motivation

Similarly to Staked ABPT, the ability to stake GHO liquidity pool tokens improves the value proposition of the SM by providing the dual service of deep GHO liquidity and protection in the case of protocol shortfall events. Additionally, Liquidity Providers (LPs) can also benefit from earning trading fees.

The Gyroscope protocol developed a concentrated liquidity AMM called Elliptic Liquidity Pools (E-CLPs) that sits on top of Balancer. This technology achieves liquidity efficiency by providing assymetric liquidity to a specific price range based on parameters like amplification, price boundaries and peak location. More information about E-CLPs can be found [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps).

With GHO trading close to $1.00 and the [GHO Stability Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-fund-usdc-usdt-gsm/17566) to be funded, now is an ideal time to add a GHO LP to the SM. By adding the GHO-USDC E-CLP, it is expected to significantly improve market depth as well as USDC liquidity with the SM. Unlike other pool types on Balancer, the E-CLP requires dual asset deposits upon entering the LP.

The Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) developed expertise on the E-CLP technology designing and incentivising one [pool](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0x3932b187f440ce7703653b3908edc5bb7676c283/) optimized for volume when closer to peg and another [pool](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0x99e7b15df044e1b62e2e1774fd4469d54d9409ac/) optimized for price volatility.

# Specification

After studying various configuration of Gyroscope's E-CLPs, karpatkey_TokenLogic recommends adding the following E-CLP to Aave's SM.

![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5336955108681965996-y|1280x592](upload://lf2kNSuj4SOig7aU2KZOvOFfvro.jpeg)

![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5336955108681965997-y|1280x618](upload://qtM2oYr8FuDoWtjjeflW4MkgLBV.jpeg)

Create a new GHO/USDC E-CLP SM Category with the following characteristics:

| Description     | Value  |
| ---             | :---:  |
| Lower Bound     | $0.996 |
| Upper Bound     | $1.001 |
| Peak            | 0.9995 |
| Amplification   | 1,250  |

The following initial E-CLP SM parameter configuration is proposed optimizing emissions for a target liquidity of $5M at 20% APR:

| Description            | Value              |
| ---                    | :---:              |
| Emissions Nomination   | GHO                |
| Daily Emission         | 2,750              |
| Slashing Rate          | 50%                |
| Cooldown Period        | 20 days            |

This proposal also recommends that GHO/USDC E-LCP is included in FastPass with the following initial parameters:

| Description            | Value              |
| ---                    | :---:              |
| FastPass Fee           | 100 bps            |
| Fee Destination        | Collector Contract |
| Daily Withdrawal Limit | 500k               |

In addition to the above, we also recommend implementing the strategy detailed in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-gho-usdc-usdt-bpt-to-safety-module/15195) which enables the DAO via the vlAURA hodling to vote BAL and AURA rewards to this SM Category. This option then enables the Aave DAO to use is strategic assets to partially sustain the SM category.

73,"Request the transparent infomation for every faming token. Farming starting, ending time and others. Do you agree the information to protect everyone to join or invest the token?",neutral
74,"### Motivation

This is for three kinds of permissions per network: `enableRecoveryMode()` for Pools, which simply provides a safe way to exit pools proportionally at the cost of disabling protocol fees (swaps, joins etc still work), `denylistToken()` which prevents withdrawing certain tokens from the protocol fee withdrawer (like we did with SNX), and `disable()` to shutdown pool factories (existing pools are unaffected, this is to prevent further pools from being created).

### Specification

The DAO multisig in each network will initiate transactions with the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling the function `grantRole` for each of the following roles using the account of the Emergency subDAO.

Title: [ARFC] Polygon v2 Borrow Rate Adjustments
Author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic & @ChaosLabs 
Created: 2024-04-04

---

# Summary

This publication proposes gradually revising the Borrow Rate on Polygon v2 to provide further encouragement for users to migrate to Aave v3.

# Motivation

Over the last [8 months](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/284/) the Reserve Factor (RF) on Polygon v2 has gradually increased from as low as 21.00% to 99.99%. As a result, deposit yield converged to zero and the capital efficiency of Aave v2 has been reduced on Polygon.

With the RF now approaching the maximum across all reserves, this publication seek to gradually increase the cost of capital via periodic borrow rate adjustments, every two weeks in a predictable fashion.

Based upon recent borrow rates behaviour, the market has demonstrated the ability to withstand periods of elevated borrowing rates. 

## Non Frozen Assets

For non-frozen assets, this proposal recommends increasing the Slope1 parameter by 75bps every two weeks, or 1.5% per month, to encourage further migration of users from v2 to v3. The outcome of this [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe2dd228640c3cad93f5418c40c4b5743b3c6c85aa0aae9eee53cbdbca2ed5c2d) has been taken into consideration when drafting the current IR parameters included in this proposal.

The Slope2 parameter is to be revised to discourage utilisation exceeding the Uoptimal value. Note, several reserves are experiencing utilisation marginally exceeding Uoptimal. 

As utilisation of each reserve decreases over time, the Uoptimal will be periodically lowered to discourage new debt positions emerging. Any proposed changes to the Uoptimal parameter will be presented via a separate ARFC. 

Upon implementation, this change will not trigger liquidation of any users funds and will gradually increase the cost for users who remain on v2. Please note, there is a Migration Tool that was developed by BGD to aid users migrating from v2 to v3. 

Assets in scope: DAI, MATIC, wBTC, wETH, USDC and USDT.

## Frozen Assets

Each frozen reserve contains a small portion of funds with a very minimal amount of debt. For these assets we recommend a more aggressive implementation: reduce the Uoptimal to 10.00%, revise Slope1 to 50.00% and Slope2 to 500.00% - with  the exception of BAL, which receives a Uoptimal of 20% due to current utilisation being around 15%.

Assets in scope: BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK and SUSHI.

# Specification

The following parameters are to be updated as follows:

| Asset | Current Slope1 | Proposed Slope1 | Current Uoptimal | Proposed Uoptimal | Current Slope2 | Proposed Slope2 |
| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---:  |   :---:   |
| BAL   | 27.00% | 50.00% | 65.00% | 20.00% | 236.00% | 500.00% |
| CRV   | 17.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 392.00% | 500.00% |
| DAI   | 12.00% | 12.75% | 71.00% | 71.00% | 105.00% |   200.00% |
| GHST  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 23.00% | 10.00% | 413.00% | 500.00% |
| LINK  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 402.00% | 500.00% |
| USDT  | 12.00% | 12.75% | 52.00% | 52.00% | 236.00% |   236.00% |
| wBTC  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 37.00% | 37.00% | 536.00% |   536.00% |
| wETH  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 40.00% | 40.00% | 167.00% |   200.00% |
| wMATIC|  6.00% |  6.75% | 48.00% | 48.00% | 440.00% |   500.00% |
| wUSDC | 12.00% | 12.75% | 77.00% | 77.00% | 134.00% |   200.00% |

Subject to approval from @ChaosLabs, a subsequent proposal will be submitted every two weeks.

# Next Steps

1) Gather feedback from the community.
2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage
4) Review, and where applicable, submit an AIP every 2 weeks

Proposal to introduce an admin fee. This would introduce a new admin fee to be distributed to veCRV holders.
This ensures all Curve stakeholders benefit from an increase in volume on Curve and it brings an additional valuable feature to being an active member of governance and CRV holder.

Specifications:

Introduce an admin fee
The admin fee would then be directed to veCRV holders, a discussion with two options on how to do so will be added in the coming hours which will then also be voted on the signalling tool.
The maximum current admin fee is 50% of the current trading fee of 0.04%.

Selecting 50% means you wish to see an admin fee of 0.02%
Selecting 25% means you wish to see an admin fee of 0.01%
Selecting 10% means you wish to see an admin fee of 0.004%
Selecting 0% means you are against the introduction of an admin fee

81,"# Motivation

There is currently 2,515,349.77 FEI in the treasury that originated from a [treasury swap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-treasury-swap-balancer-dao-fei-dao/2254) that occurred in October 2021.  Under the original agreement, the DAO was to use these funds for operational expenses.  The SP’s passed so far require payment in USDC, so I believe it is a good time to convert the FEI into USDC so that the DAO can use it later on to pay expenses without needing to convert the FEI every time the DAO pays out.  

## Specification

1. Balancer DAO multisig **0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f** will approve 2,515,349.77 * 10^(18) FEI to the **FixedPricePSM** contract at **0x2a188f9eb761f70ecea083ba6c2a40145078dfc2**

* minAmountOut: 2513349770000000000000000 (2000$ less than amt fei in, let me know if anyone has any concerns with this number)




3. **0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f** will approve 2513349770000000000000000 (min amount out above) DAI to be spent by the **Maker: PSM-USDC-A** contract at **0x0A59649758aa4d66E25f08Dd01271e891fe52199**

# Proposal by Gyroscope

> ## Summary
> 
> * **This is a proposal to enable a Balancer gauge for a swETH/wstETH pool on Balancer Ethereum**.
> * **The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP).** E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.
> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope. As a Core pool it will be eligible for fee recycling.

> ## References/Useful links

> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)

> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)

> ## Protocol description
> 
> * stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)
> * wstETH is a wrapped version of regular stETH, while wETH is a wrapped version of Ethereum.
> * swETH is an ERC-20 token that represents a user’s staked ETH in the Ethereum blockchain inclusive of any accrued rewards and penalties from the consensus layer, and MEV and ‘tips’ from the execution layer. The amount of swETH held will not change over a period of time but the underlying value of the token will increase as the rewards accrue on chain. - [Swell](https://docs.swellnetwork.io/swell/system-design/staking-with-sweth/sweth-token)
> * The E-CLP uses an internal conversion to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.

> ## Motivation
> 
> **We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency significantly.** The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:
> 
> * **Customizable liquidity profiles:** Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
> * **Price bounds:** The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.
> 
> For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs view: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps
> 
> E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs).

## Specifications

> ### Governance
> 
> The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.

> ### Oracles
> 
> * rateProvider0 (for wstETH): [0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768#code)
> * rateProvider1 (for swETH): [0xf951E335afb289353dc249e82926178EaC7DEd78](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf951E335afb289353dc249e82926178EaC7DEd78)
> * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)

> ### Audits
> 
> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.

> ### Centralization vectors
> 
> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.

> ### Market History
> 
> C.f. contracts.

> ### Value
> 
> As per “Motivation”. Other Ethereum Balancer pools with these assets exist, but none of them feature asymmetrically concentrated liquidity. Asymmetric concentrated liquidity for these assets could become a substantial driver of trading volume and total value locked.

83,"To keep it simple theres 5 types of bunny you can get and it's random. The bunny design is the same as the starter profiles you Sleepy, Sunny, Churro, Dollop & Twinkle. 

* Each bunny costs $5 worth of cake, the cake then gets added to the rewards pool and 10% of it will be burnt. 
* You can only buy a maximum of 5 bunnies per day. 

The goal of the game is simply combine 2 of the same type of bunny to upgrade and then earn cake rewards. So for example combining 2x level 1 Sleepy = Level 2 Sleepy and combining 2x level 2 Sleepy = level 3.


Farming
At the end of the day the rewards pool will distribute all level 2+ bunny

* Level 1 = 0 share 
* Level 2 = 1 share 
* Level 3 = 2.5 share
* Level 4 = 5.5 share
* Level 5 = 11.5 share
* Level 6 = 23.5 share
* Level 7 = 47.5 share
* Level 8 = 95.5 share
* Level 9 = 191.5 share
* Level 10 = 383.5 share

So for example if level 2 gets $1 as a reward then level 3 should get $2.5.

85,"## Summary
Decide an strategy to sunset Aave v1 Ethereum and Aave v1 AMM, given the existence for a long time already of v2 and v3 versions of the Aave liquidity protocol.

## Context
Aave V1 was deployed on the Ethereum network back in January 2020, being the first step of everything that would come afterward on the Aave ecosystem. Since then, countless developments happened in the community, amongst them, 2 more iterations of the protocol: Aave v2 and Aave v3.

After the deployment of Aave v2 Ethereum, almost 2 years ago (December 2020), the general approach of the community was to progressively sunset Aave v1, with steps like enabling a migration tool v1 → v2 and disabling stable borrowing on v1 (more information here https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-protocol-v1-v2-migration-tool-and-transition-plan/2053 2)

## Options proposed
- **Freezing (disable additive actions)**. Probably the natural one, to reduce any kind of overhead from the community going forward.
- **Disable variable borrowing**. Less aggressive, with the plan to follow up with another to freeze the pools.
- **Do nothing**. Keep v1 as it is, just waiting for everybody to exit the pool, and nobody entering.",bearish
86,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust two (2) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Loan To Value, across one (1) Aave V2 asset.

## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.

These parameter recommendations reflect the unique situation of REN in the current market conditions.  

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **REN Liquidation Threshold**     | 65%     | ***60%***     |
| **REN Loan To Value**     | 60%     | ***55%***     |



## Notable Accounts to Flag

As of 11/16/2022, the data shows that only one dust account, `0x0e1337ea2c604f9a937d2623af206cdd02167b38` would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This account has a total of ~$100 in supply.

This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on this forum post.



## Risk Dashboard

The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

# Abstract


[GIP-64](https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0xd9dbc0cebba7b9a27f6fa3f30987b89b4dd50140ee3e21624ebc9bdb16049654) prompted GnosisDAO to distribute an additional portion of the SAFE supply, aimed at promoting decentralisation on the Gnosis Chain. In the context of a [token swap agreement](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x8d4969e56fa8eb13abc7a3404b3d42fe6b4afa1c7f29111bd012314f093a2fd2), Balancer DAO received GNO tokens from GnosisDAO, which were then locked in the [LGNO locking contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4f8ad938eba0cd19155a835f617317a6e788c868). This deposit qualifies the Balancer DAO for these additional benefits, as it satisfies the requirement of having ""GNO in locking contracts on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain."" The current proposal aims to claim 119,196.473 Safe tokens, receiving them in the  [Balancer DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f).

104,"This is a bit complex so think it through:

In a nutshell;
Binance allows shorting CAKE. So CAKE can become like a stable coin by purchasing 50%
CAKE and Shorting 50% CAKE - and then auto rebalancing with an algorithm as required depending on if
CAKE price goes up or down. Use this to pay high APR for staking stable coins.

In more detail:

1 Allow users to stake stable coins - USDT, USDC, BUSD, etc.. on PCS.

2 Write code to automatically market buy CAKE with staked stable coins.

3 Write code to automatically stake half of the CAKE in the CAKE syrup pool.

4 With the other half of the purchased CAKE write code to automatically short CAKE (work with Binance
to set this up).

5 Write code to keep the proper ratio of CAKE in the syrup pool vs. CAKE being shorted so that there is
minimal gain or loss with the fluctuations of CAKE price. (Think this through, it is possible excluding the
transaction fees and short interest charged). Chefs are smart they can figure this out and write an
algorithim that works.

6 You are going to have to pay fees and shorting interest - this will be paid from the CAKE profits from
the 50% CAKE staked.

Presently CAKE pays 67% APR. Let's pretned 7% of that goes to transaction fees and shorting fees (it is
likely much less than that). So we are down to 60% APR.
But only half of the CAKE is being staked. So we cut the APR in half to 30%.

When someone withdrawls their stable coin, the CAKE is removed from the Short postion and Syrup
pool in proper porportions and converted back to the stable coin and they get their stable coin with the
staking profits.

Staking stables for 30% profit ? Fantastic, but let's not be that nice.
Take half of the CAKE profits and burn them!!

So you get 15% APR profits for staking a stable coin. Still pretty awesome!

How beneficial is this really ?

1) Hundreds of millions of dollars will be staked. How do I know ? Check the stable farms usdc-busd,
usdc-usdt, etc.. They have hundreds of millions and the APR is around 8 to 10%. Therefore hundreds of
millions of dollars of CAKE will be market purchased and locked up and out of circulation. Supply and
Demand!

2) 50% of the CAKE purchased will never earn rewards and won't dilute the CAKE syrup pool. It will be
on Binance shorting CAKE.

3) The other 50% will earn CAKE but half of it gets burned, helping turn CAKE deflationary.

4) Many in crypto keep a portion of their crypto in stables, if they can earn 15% APR in stables on a
reliable and trustworhty platform they will do it.

This is a game changer if it can be implemented, I hope you vote yes. As the person coming up with this idea, if it is accepted AND implemented by the Chefs I would ask the first 3000 CAKE burned by this mechanism be sent to the address of this proposal as a reward.",bullish

113,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Seedify.fund ($SFUND) to Syrup Pool!

 
Dear CAKE holders, today we are excited to offer you a new Syrup Pool from Seedify.fund, an incubator and launchpad for blockchain games and metaverses.


#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $SFUND tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 53,800 SFUND
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 11am UTC on November 25th 2021
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11am UTC on January 24th 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.0311 SFUND

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the Seedify.fund Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a SFUND-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

#### What is SFUND?

From the team: “SFUND is the life force of Seedify.fund Launchpad and its gaming ecosystem. By holding and staking SFUND, Seedify.fund community members are able to participate in Initial Game Offerings launched on Seedify.fund.”

114,"The objective of this proposal is to share ideas on how we can do the following. 

1. Increase rewards for farmers
2. Increase the utility of staked CAKE
3. Increase the protocol revenue 
4. Reduce CAKE emissions
5. Get closer to ultrasound money

Every few weeks we vote to change the rewards for each farm, reducing some and increaing others.  This method should be scraped and replaced with a ""ve"" type voting gauge. 

Staked CAKE holders could then vote on how the CAKE rewards should be split between the farms. 
If a farm get 5% of the vote then they get 5% of the CAKE rewards. 

Once a vote deadline has been hit, them reward amounts are locked in for 2 weeks and then votes are recounted every 2 weeks. 

On top of the Gauge voting system we build a UI for bribes, where farmers and 3rd party protocols can offer a payment to staked CAKE holders in exchange for their votes. 

As the bribe UI builds up and the bribes start coming in, we can start reducing the CAKE emissions being paid to the staked CAKE holders.  Replacing CAKE emissions with income from other protocols. 
The reduction of emissions to the staked CAKE pool should be at a slow and steady rate of 1 CAKE per block per month until the rewards are 0 CAKE emissions. 

After the first reduction in emissions to the staked CAKE pool the protocol will redirect 5% of the trading fees (from the 0.01% and 0.05% farms) to rewarding the staked CAKE pool.  

To kickstart the system the rewards to farmers should be increased by 0.25 CAKE per block per month over a 6 month time frame, increasing the emissions by 1.5 CAKE per block.  Once the ecosystem is up and running we can look at reducing these emissions. 



The expected outcome.

1. Emissions reduced by 0.75 CAKE per block a month with a total reduction of 5.15 CAKE per block after 7 months. a 55% reduction in emissions. 
2. Staked CAKE holders rewards switch from emissions to bribes + trading fees, avoiding a massive overnight cut in rewards. 
3. Farmers see an steady increase in the overall rewards allocated to farming. 
4. 3rd party protocols have the option to buy voting power with bribes, which should increase the liquidity in their farms. 
5. 3rd party protocols now have a reason to buy and hold staked CAKE so they can vote for their own liquidity pools. 
6. Staked CAKE voting power has an increased value,",bearish

116,"## [Payload PR - BIP-199](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/82)

## Background
The poolRecoveryHelper is a smart contract, which allows permissionless calling of the enableRecoveryMode() call
assuming that any of the rate providers used in a given pool are failing.  This allows anyone in the balancer or greater web3 community to
put the pools into a state where bad rateProvider data does not create routing issues.  It also allows for permissionless
automation to be setup to look for problems and quickly react.

More details on RecoveryMode and the poolRecovery Manager can be found in the text of [BIP-121](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-121-permission-granting-recovery-mode/4045) which originally introduced these concepts.

This BIP requests adding authoriation for the pool recovery manager to operate on the recently deployed [v3 Weighted Pool Factory](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20230206-weighted-pool-v3) and the [v3 Composable Stable Pool Factory](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks//20230206-composable-stable-pool-v3) and all pools generated by them.

## Risk Assessment
This BIP is about allowing automation and the greater Web3 community to move pools into a state where there is less risk,
in situations where there could be some concern about their function.  A number of higher AUM V2 pools spent quite a bit
of time in Recovery Mode recently as a result of some recently discovered and patched [reentrency issues](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345).
It has been well demonstrated that, while recoveryMode can create some minor UX problems for exiting pools and results in less revenue being earned by the DAO, it otherwise has no ill-effects nor creates new risk.

119,"*Summary*

Despite being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols, Uniswap’s outstanding voting power does not necessarily translate into active governance participation. In fact, many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50% vote participation rate, and some even as low as 10% or 0%. While there have been previous [campaigns ](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1653077861706739714?s=20) to encourage delegation by large UNI holders, we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated, if at all.

In healthy governance environments, proactive delegates wield significant voting power, ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met.

Therefore, this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate 2.5 million UNI to each of 4 active yet underrepresented delegates selected based on the criteria outlined below. To ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum (as explained further in Participation Requirements) or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will 1 year term so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without fulling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.

*Landscape of Uniswap Governance*

Despite numerous improvements to Uniswap’s governance, there are still several areas that require further improvement. One prominent area is governance participation, which has witnessed a downward trend compared to late 2022 and early 2023.

Another issue is many large delegates are now inactive, and the delegators who entrusted them with delegation are either unaware about this inactivity or simply do not care. For example, there is currently several delegates with more than 2.5 million UNI delegated who never even voted onchain according to Tally, see the screenshot below.

*Source: Tally*

Therefore, further distributing governance power to active but underrepresented delegates is a positive step forward ensuring governance is more active, resilient, and robust.

**Participation Requirements**

* Must have voted on 80% (or more) of proposals (minus the proposals that were canceled) over the last 3 months (as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot). This includes both Snapshot and Onchain proposals (such as Tally or Agora)
* Must have actively participated in proposal voting for more than 3 months and have a Delegate Platform on Uniswap Forum under Delegation Pitch

**Application Criteria**

* Meets the above Participation Requirements
* Voting Power is less than 2.5 million UNI (as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot).

**Next Steps**

* Should this proposal pass on Snapshot, a 5-day period will begin where delegates that meet the above criterias are encouraged to post their application to be considered for delegation. In cases where there are more than Four qualified applicants, there will be an additional Snapshot vote to determine the top Four. Once Four or fewer applicants are selected (in case there are not enough delegates that meet the criteria), it will proceed to an onchain vote.

**Other Clarification**

-The term will be 1 year from when 2.5 M UNI is delegated.

-Should the onchain vote be approved but there are three or fewer qualified applicants because there are not enough qualified applicants, there WON'T be a subsequent application period and Snapshot vote after the initial vote to fill the remaining available recipients.

-Should the onchain vote be approved and there are qualified applicants but one or more of them are disqualified in the future due to their low vote participation, there will NOT be a new application and snapshot vote to give the opportunity to another delegate.

-As mentioned by in a previous [proposal ](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-onboarding-ekubo-inc-as-a-core-developer-of-uniswap-protocol/22085/20) seeking UNI delegation, there will be deployment of at max four new [Franchiser ](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/blob/main/spec.md) contracts, each one funded with 2.5M UNI (10M UNI total). The owner of these Franchiser instance’s would be the Timelock, while the at max four delegates chosen through the voting process outlined above can act as the delegatees.",bullish

As previously mentioned on community updates, Mkflow is stepping down as director of the Balancer Foundation to take up other roles in the community. Firstly, the Foundation directors and management would like to thank Mkflow for his services, which have been a great addition in the early stages of establishing operations. The Board also notes they have accepted Mkflow’s resignation effective 1 December 2022.

The Foundation board has screened candidates for the role and has identified Danko as the best fit for the current needs of the Foundation.

Danko is well known in the Balancer community, and I’ll include some background here for those less acquainted. Danko has been a Balancer DAO community member since Q2 of 2022, when he first joined the Operations and Partnerships subDAO as a Baller. As the DAO's framework began to shift in Q3, Danko joined the Balancer Maxis workgroup, being responsible for onboarding new DAO members and helping contributors and third-party projects navigate the protocol. During this time, Danko has proven himself a reliable and trustworthy member of the Balancer community, representing Balancer in several key meetings, events, and conversations.

Danko is a Founding Member of BanklessBR DAO, a Brazilian community that helps people enter the web3 space, where he was a core-team contributor until last July, publishing and translating several articles, specially on the topic of DAO communities. He was also an active member of numerous NFT communities and supported local artists with web3 education.

IRL, Danko has more than 13 years’ experience in law enforcement as a forensic scientist and investigator. His formal academic background includes a Bachelor’s degree in law and a Masters degree in Public Policies. This drives Danko’s interest in the DeFi space in general, and the future of our industry.

As there will be no overlap of directors, there will be no additional cost to the Balancer DAO and no funds are requested under this proposal.

128,"##### ABSTRACT

Laughing Ape won’t just talk about “Mass Adoption” of $APE and $APE Chain as theoretical possibilities, WE WILL ACTUALLY BRING ABOUT MASS ADOPTION TO THE NORMIES who will use $APE for their everyday Laughing Ape purchases and perks.

What’s the point?

Comedy Clubs, events, and content distribution are stuck in the past using the same tired old methods they used decades ago and yet it’s still a multibillion dollar a year industry.

Laughing Ape will bring live stand-up performance kicking and screaming into the present and the future utilizing live-streaming, Metaverse simulcasting and NFTs/Blockchain to enhance the performances, merch offerings and distribution models.

We’ve already shown you how much fun a Laughing Ape event can be, now we’re asking for the funding to take our concepts and build a global comedy performance and distribution empire!

We’re proud of our accomplishments and footprint in Web3 and now we want to scale our operations to a much larger audience: Comedy lovers who pay to watch comedy, whether they’re in Web2, Web3 or living off the grid, only coming into town for supplies and entertainment,

Laughing Ape will be their number one choice for comedy performance IRL, Live-Streaming, Simulcast in the Metaverse or appearing on their favorite streaming service or movie screen.

In supporting our AIP, $APE Coin DAO will go down in history as the reason Laughing Ape became the global powerhouse in comedy for many decades to come.

How will this benefit $APE DAO?

In addition to getting 6.9% of gross revenue in perpetuity (in other words “4Eva!”), Laughing Ape will make $APE DAO and $APE Coin and even $APE Chain a household name.

Seeing “Powered By $APE Coin” alongside A-list comedians and global, infinitely scaling live events is, dare I say, even more valuable to the DAO than the rev share.

Funding Laughing Ape’s proposal will also show the DAO voters have the appetite to swing big and make things happen.

Sure, sitting on a pile of $APE like Scrooge McDuck is fun, but spreading that $APE out into various enterprises that touch, not just Web3, but also communities outside of our great, little community will spread awareness, emotional attachment to our $APE brand and bring new members into our DAO.

In other words: LFG out and make people fall in love with $APE and making them laugh day in and day out is a valuable way to do it!

TL;DR Again!
* Massive comedy events streamed live to movie theaters across the globe!
* Hundreds of Laughing Ape Membership Chapters across the globe with regular comedy events!
* All events streamed live to a global online audience!
* The biggest, bestest $APE-themed Comedy Club Metaverse in the world!
* An international comedy school with online and IRL classes!
* Check this out: We’re giving $APE Coin DAO 6.9% of Laughing Ape’s revenues for-freaking ever!
* All shows branded as “Powered by $APE Coin”!
* We’ll look to collaborate and partner with the best and brightest of Web3 companies/organizations like Mocaverse (Aaron’s a holder), Wicked Craniums/TruSTUB (Aaron’s a holder), BAYC MBA’s (Aaron’s a holder and an MBA License holder), Mocaverse and Sandbox (Aaron’s a Holder of both), JRNY Club (You guessed it, Aaron’s a holder).

Now let’s dive a little deeper, shall we?

Laughing Ape Builds A Global, Freaking Comedy Empire!

From exclusive local comedy club shows in cities around the world to massive A-List special events live-streamed to movie theaters, the Metaverse and personal devices globally, Aaron Haber and Laughing Ape, with the help of $APE Coin DAO will revolutionize how comedy is produced, distributed and consumed all while bringing about the mass adoption of $APE/Ape Chain to the normies.

Yeah, I said “mass adoption” and I mean “mass adoption” read on!

Massive comedy events streamed live to movie theaters across the globe!

Laughing Ape will produce live-streaming comedy events featuring both household names and up and coming comedians from around the world. We’ll look to partner with major movie theater chains as special events partners.

Due to many challenges the Movie theater exhibitor industry (Aaron Haber is a Movie Theater Exhibition Nepo Baby) is desperately looking for new streams of content.

Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour grossed $262 million worldwide without going through the traditional distribution network and instead partnering directly with AMC the world’s largest movie theater chain.

This was a shocking and shockingly successful deal in the world of movie theater exhibition.

Laughing Ape ain’t Taylor Swift (though we’re total Swifties) but we’re pretty darn sure our comedy events will gross tens of millions of dollars during the lifetime of a similar deal with a chain such as AMC.

Hundreds of Laughing Ape Membership Chapters across the globe with regular comedy events!

Laughing Ape will open Membership Chapters in cities across the globe.

Each Chapter can have an unlimited number of members who will pay an annual membership fee.

In addition to exclusive comedy events. Members will always have first access to shows, events and merch/album drops.

All current holders of $APE (there will be a snapshot) will get their first year of Laughing Ape Membership for free and become their city’s very first Laughing Ape Fellows (A fancy way of saying “members”).

Laughing Ape Membership allows early access to comedy events, as well as special access to exclusive Laughing Ape events, both IRL, streaming and in the Metaverse. However there is still a ticket charge (discounted) for Members to attend Laughing Ape events and shows.

A certain number of seats will be set aside for current $APE Holders to attend these events for free for at least 1 year.

All events streamed live to a global online audience!

Most every Laughing Ape show and event will be streamed live behind a paywall and/or token gated solution.

Anyone with a connected device will be able to purchase tickets to these performances.

There are billions of connected devices around the world.

Laughing Ape Chapter Members can purchase individual streaming tickets or monthly/annual viewing passes.

Current $APE Holders (which includes Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild Holders - more to be announced) will gain access to our streaming shows for free for the 1st year.

The biggest, bestest $APE-themed Comedy Club Metaverse in the world!

The Club below THE Club, Below Bored is the first and greatest Comedy Club Metaverse launched!

Below Bored will live stream most, if not all, of Laughing Ape’s comedy events and shows.

Current Below Bored NFT Pass Holders will get access to premium spaces within the club.

Current $APE Holders (which includes Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild Holders - more to be announced) will be granted free access to Below Bored for at least 1 year.

An international comedy school with online and IRL classes!

Aaron Haber has taught comedy to hundreds of students all around the world including Comedy Masterclasses at Princeton University.

Laughing Ape’s Comedy School will use Aaron’s syllabi to establish its online comedy school.

Laughing Ape Members will get a discount on all classes.

$APE Holders (which includes Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild Holders - more to be announced) will have access to audit the classes and discounts should they want to participate fully in the class.

We’re giving $APE Coin DAO 6.9% of Laughing Ape’s revenues for-freaking ever!

Laughing Ape will give $APE Coin DAO 6.9% of revenue in perpetuity (like, 4eva, Brah!)

Originally we were going to give 5% but rounded up to the next sexiest percentage available.

All shows branded with “Powered by $APE Coin!”

All shows and events will be branded with “Powered By $APE Coin!”.

This included streaming events at movie theaters, festivals, concert halls, arenas, everything.

While we’re Web3 denizens (and degens) at heart, we’ll be getting the $APE brand in front of a tremendous amount of Normies coming to our shows and events and consuming our content.

We have various levels of conversations being conducted with potential board members, major movie theater content distributors and a major player in the streaming industry.

We’ll look to collaborate and partner with the best and brightest of Web3 companies/organizations.

[A link to the Medium article outlining the full budget can be found here.](https://medium.com/@aaron_15091/laughing-apes-aip-424-full-budget-breakdown-16902935a58d)

We have created a sizzle reel specifically for the DAO. This highlight reel captures the essence of our shows and events, offering a condensed and engaging overview. We believe this sizzle reel effectively conveys the atmosphere and success of our events, allowing DAO members to fully appreciate the impact and potential of our proposal.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

4 main things
1. Money back to the DAO
* 6.9% Rev share in perpetuity (After Funding. Meaning we’re not giving 6.9% of our initial funding back. That would be some inception type stuff right there.)
* Yo, Dude who never actually reads the AIPs and says “Unless AIPs give money back to the DAO blah blah” WE ARE GIVING 6.9% REV SHARE BACK TO THE DAO 4-EVA!

2. Seamless $APE integration for our global customers. (Mass Adoption, anyone?)
* Every ticket, piece of merch, comedy class, etc will be available for purchase using $APE.
* We will look to have all Blockchain interactions/NFTs be on $APE Chain.
* Seamless $APE integration for Normies = Buy $APE via Credit Card.
* When $APE is used for purchases a discount will be applied making $APE our preferred method of payment and the preferred method of payment for customers who want a discount.

3. Perks for current $APE, Mocaverse and other delegations holders.
* When the AIP passes we will announce a Snapshot date.
* All holders of $APE, Mocaverse NFTs, JRNY Club Assets, Surreal Guild NFTs (with room to include many more communities that are integral to $APE DAO) will receive a Perk Pass which will include 1 year of free Laughing Ape Club Membership, Free tickets to IRL and streaming/Metaverse Laughing Ape Events. Discounts on merch and all the other stuff we’ll be releasing for 1 year (We’ll probably extend past 1 year, but right now we’re only promising 1 year, ok?)

4. Laughing Ape will create a sense of fun and awesomeness (probably a word) for the $APE Coin DAO.


##### OVERALL COST 

Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $3,167,000 USD

We aim to raise $3,167,000 USD in $APE to fund our operations including team, tech, talent and marketing. Yes, it’s a big swing but this gives us the opportunity to launch strong and conquer the industry and return major value back to the DAO.

129,"#### Upgrade of Galxe’s Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift Galxe’s Farm rewards from the current GAL-BNB v2 LP to the new GAL-BNB v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the GAL-BNB v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the GAL token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current GAL price.)

To ensure a smooth transition between v2 and v3 pairs, there will be an overlap of one day where there will be incentives directed towards both farms. This will occur on 5 May 2023. 

After **0900 UTC on 5 May 2023**, only the v3 pair will receive incentives, so users are encouraged to migrate in advance of this time.

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new Farm will have doubled emissions for the first 7 days. For example, if the v2 farm emits 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will emit 20 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 10 CAKE per day thereafter.

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake GAL-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.5x multiplier
- **24 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.25% fee tier):
- Stake GAL-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 1.2x multiplier (2.4x multiplier for the first 7 days)
- 48 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and **24 CAKE per day** thereafter 

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 1.2x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### Key timelines

* **Launch of GAL-BNB v3 farm:** Approx. 0900 UTC on 5 May 2023
* **Sunset of GAL-BNB v2 farm:** Approx. 0900 UTC on 6 May 2023

#### How to migrate?

Please remember to shift your LP to the new farm before the v2 farm sunsets.

Please refer to the following [**link**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/code/v3-migration/how-to-migrate) for migration instructions

#### What is Galxe?

Galxe helps developers and organizations leverage NFTs and digital credential data to build better products and communities in Web3.

#### What is $GAL?
From the team: “Galxe aims to build a permissionless, open, and collaborative credential data network. The GAL token is an essential component of such infrastructures as it functions as the governance token, incentivizes user participation, and serves as the primary payment token of the Galxe ecosystem.

The use cases of GAL are as follows:

- Governance: GAL token holders can vote on Project Galaxy DAO’s governance proposals
- Paying for Fees: Developers who aim to utilize Galaxy’s credential data will be charged in GAL
- Curating Credentials: Curators are incentivized to stake GAL tokens to signal a credential data sets value. Each credential data set will include a revenue stream that will be split between credential stakeholders pro-rata”

Avalanche: Signal for deployment

Summary

The Avalanche Foundation asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into Avalanche.

Proposer

The Avalanche Foundation is dedicated to supporting the Avalanche ecosystem and related technologies. The Foundation is part of a larger Avalanche ecosystem and working with other organizations to support the significant development of Avalanche-related technologies.

Avalanche is one of the fastest smart contracts platforms in the blockchain industry, as measured by time-to-finality, and has the most validators securing its activity of any proof-of-stake protocol. Avalanche’s C-Chain is an instance of the EVM running with Avalanche’s consensus.

Rationale

Current status of the Avalanche C-Chain: The Avalanche network is secured by over 1,000 validators and is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of Avalanche consensus. While maintaining this level of decentralization, the network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 1-2 seconds, making the network’s C-Chain an incredible playground for DeFi and other EVM applications. The ecosystem already has a slew of native projects offering exchange, lending, and aggregation services, over $1.5bn bridged from Ethereum, over $2.2bn in TVL, and protocols such as SushiSwap and Curve deployed or in the process of deploying.

Why it is good for the Aave ecosystem: The Avalanche blockchain is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, and near-instant finality. Through the Avalanche Rush program, the Avalanche foundation has allocated up to $20M AVAX for users of the Aave protocol over a three-month period to earn AVAX rewards while using Aave on Avalanche for the first phase of the program. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established Avalanche community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on established chains like Avalanche will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.

Why signaling is necessary? Consistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, he Avalanche Foundation believes that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on – and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. The Avalanche Rush announcement received a lot of interest from both the Aave and Avalanche communities. Deploying the Aave protocol on Avalanche will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.

Next Steps

Creation of Snapshot vote for the Aave community to signal YES/NO for deployment on Avalanche.
Deployment of smart contracts in Avalanche C-Chain and activation of liquidity mining program.",bearish
133,"# LONG TERM SYRUP POOL CAKE STAKING # 
It’s time for our vote to have locked CAKE staking! The end goal of locked staking is to become CAKE holder with earning profit for long period, that means more CAKE staking and burning.


**Why you should participate in long term staking?**

It enables CAKE holders to earn substantially higher APY's than short unlocked staking, traditional savings accounts or money market funds. With long term staking we can burn more cake and may effect reducing the amount of CAKE in circulation may have on the token’s price. 





**⚠️Please note⚠️**

CAKE hodlers should understand the potential effect of long term staking. Earlier redemption will be availbe with fees, which will burn.

***You can vote for any one of these three options!***

141,"### Summary

This proposal aims to **establish Balancer Grants DAO, an independent community-owned grants program for the Balancer ecosystem.** The program aims to accelerate the development of the BAL ecosystem while optimizing contributor rewards in the Balancer ecosystem. **The requested budget for the first cycle (3 months) is 25,000 BAL, 80% of which will be allocated to grantees, as visualized in the breakdown below.** A learnings and review document will be created at the end of the cycle, and any unspent resources will be sent back to the BAL treasury.

The initial Balancer Grants team has already worked together for the past 4 weeks to create the basic grant framework and community channels - check it out here:[ https://balancer.community/](https://balancer.community/)

This is a synthesized version of the proposal. You can read the full text [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-establish-the-balancer-grants-dao-and-coordinate-the-next-wave-of-balancer-community-grants/2095). 

### Background

Grants and contributor rewards are important mechanisms for coordinating resources and developing ecosystems. Multiple large blockchain projects and DAOs have dedicated grant programs with varying success. Balancer hosted and ran its own grants through grants[ wave 1](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/why-the-balancer-community-received-over-1m-in-grants-434c9cab3908) and[ wave 2](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/batch-2-of-balancer-ecosystem-fund-grants-is-now-available-c6b1bf567483). The grants have attracted various resources and developers to the Balancer ecosystem but have recently slowed down.

The grants program has been hampered in its growth due to the over-reliance on the foundation team. This has meant there has been a lack of resources, tooling, and support for existing grantees. Additionally, the resource constraint has meant slow turnaround and suboptimal user experience for those who may join the ecosystem.

This is a part of the Balancer ecosystem that deserves more attention and with the right planning it can start to shine.

The grants committee has researched over 15 blockchain grants programs to get a clear overview of what an effective program looks like. We will combine multiple aspects of successful programs with original ideas from the grants committee and valuable feedback from the Balancer Labs team and community.

### PROPOSAL

We propose a rework of the current grants program by establishing the Balancer Grants DAO, a community-operated grants DAO dedicated to developing the Balancer Ecosystem.

The grant program provides support and funding ($5K - USD 75K, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem.

The Balancer Grants DAO will initially be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee can be found further in this proposal.

#### How the Grant review process will look

At Balancer, we want our applicants to feel heard and supported, not only financially. That is why we want this process to be as clear as possible. During the evaluation, the Grant Committee looks at the reasonable viability of the applications and does due diligence on the team. The evaluation process takes about 2 weeks.

If the application is successful, the team will be contacted, further steps will be discussed, and they will be connected with a mentor for regular calls to keep up to date and provide support. It is expected that this is reciprocated by grantees through operational transparency, high developer velocity, active repositories and frequent communications towards us.

### Grant Milestone Review

Balancer Grants will work with milestone based payouts. These milestones are clear and reasonable targets based on the communication between the grantees and the Grant Committee.

Grantees are encouraged to map their deliverables and timeline. We have provided a GANNT style template that grantees can use here:[ Project GANNT](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17EMQk0fYKbNsNzb6R21tLDPaHzBkX0K8cRO4MGgx19U/edit?usp=sharing)

Rewards Grants are awarded in BAL tokens, based on predefined installments. Such installments are subject to a payment schedule to ensure that predefined milestones are achieved, and the first milestone can be prepaid. If a Grant application is larger than 75K USD, the project will have to be split into multiple Grant applications. The grants can be priced in either USD or BAL value, to be selected by the grantee at the start of the grant. If a grantee decides to price their reward in USD, 50% of the grant’s value will be converted from BAL to a stable asset to reduce market risk for the Balancer Grants DAO.

The Balancer Grants Committee controls payments and assesses milestone reports from grantees before follow-on payments. The Balancer Grants Committee may decide not distribute all follow-up payments for projects that do not hit their deliverables.

### Risks Analysis and Mitigation

- How does the Balancer Grant DAO ensure that grants contribute meaningfully?

To ensure that the Balancer Grants are allocated in line with the needs of the Balancer Ecosystem, an[ Ecosystem Assessment form](https://hi704760.typeform.com/to/lLmGUEEb) has been created by the Balancer Grants DAO and sent to 10 active contributors of the Balancer ecosystem operating in different areas to get a full picture of the current needs of the ecosystem. The results will be summarized by the Balancer Grants DAO and discussed during a to be organized open workshop.

- What happens if there are not sufficient quality grant applications?

All leftover grant funds get sent back to the BAL treasury in low participation or not enough quality applications.

- What if grants apply but do not deliver?

Although this is a common issue within all grant systems, we can mitigate this risk by providing mentoring and support. This will be one of the defining aspects of our approach—something that is often overlooked. Additionally, payments are always based on Milestones, limiting the potential resources lost when a grantee cannot deliver.

### Specification

If approved, the Grants Committee multi-sig (currently 3 out of 4) will be funded with 25K BAL. The resources will be further divided across different multi-sigs controlled by the same group.

If approved, the [Grants Committee multi-sig (currently 3 out of 4)](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597/balances) will be funded with 25K BAL. The resources will be further divided across different multi-sigs controlled by the same group.

All transactions will be recorded in a Sheet and summarized at the end of the Grants Cycle.

### Balancer Grants Composition

The Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds.

* Zeb Lelie: Senior Crypto-asset researcher - Grants Lead
* Luuk Weber - Baller
* Nick Tong - Baller
* Solarcurve - Baller
* **Open position: If you feel called to fill this spot, please let us know. Ideally, someone with a strong technical background.**

The Grants Committee will work closely with Balancer Labs, Ballers, Fire Eyes, and Kolektivo Labs to amplify and support grantees.

By having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi. A crucial area that has been largely overlooked.

### Budget breakdown

This budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants DAO for the period August 1st till October 31st.

At the end of this cycle (October 31st), any unspent resources will be sent back to the Balancer Treasury. A new proposal for the next cycle will be submitted at the end of this cycle.

This is a proposal to provide Balancer DAO with an automated way to collect the fees that the protocol has earned from its different layers, convert and bridge them if needed. Therefore, later on, an authorized party can withdraw and distribute them as bribes, to the DAO and to veBAL holders. The goal is to ensure that protocol fee collecting process is fully trustless and automated.

# 1. About Mimic

Mimic is a platform that allows you to deploy tailored infrastructure to automate (and/or delegate) access to DeFi, in a secure and 100% non-custodial way. Mimic is especially suitable to replace and speed up manual and centralized tasks while tracking and monitoring every detail. This is achieved through our innovative **Smart Vaults** concept: an automated and trustless solution that can be customized to suit your operation needs.

Deploying a Smart Vault is simple. We only need to figure out the best configuration that suits your needs and customize one for you. Moreover, Mimic provides you with lots of multi-layer flexibility, it can be easily scaled up by deploying and connecting additional Smart Vaults.

 
![smartValut.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreigf4kq2llrgqfetotcgcojmfigz646vhumbiox6sa7g6tesj6obly)
    

Our team members have a large experience in blockchain and especially in DeFi protocols. We have previously worked for many well-known projects like Aave, Balancer, Open Zeppelin, Aragon, POAP and The Graph.

# 2. Background

Currently Balancer DAO collects protocol fees in three layers: Mainnet, Polygon and Arbitrum:

Mainnet: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F

Polygon: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F

Arbitrum: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F

As documented in [[BIP-19] Incentivize Core Pools & L2 Usage](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329):

- All fees earned on Polygon & Arbitrum are used as bribes for core pools on those networks, weighted proportionally by TVL of those core pools - after the DAO takes its 25%.
- All fees earned by Ethereum core pools are used as bribes on those pools (each pool gets its own fees as a bribe), after the DAO takes its 25%.
- All fees earned by Ethereum non-core pools are sent to veBAL and the DAO (75/25 split).
- Protocol fee collection, distribution, and any subsequent bribing take place every two weeks on Monday instead of weekly on Wednesday.
- All fees earned are converted to USDC, except BAL and BAL-like assets which are converted to BAL
- All bribes are paid in USDC

# 3. Core Proposal

Our proposal is to provide Balancer DAO with a **solution to automate** how it collects and distributes its protocol fees. To accomplished this, Mimic will deploy three customized Smart Vaults owned by Balancer DAO, one on each layer.

All Smart Vaults will only be allowed to collect earned fees when they reach a pre-determined value in USDC. If fees collected are BAL-like assets they will be converted to BAL, otherwise they will be converted to USDC. Both Polygon and Arbitrum Smart Vaults will bridge all USDC and BAL accumulated to the Mainnet Smart Vault every two weeks (one period).

Finally, an authorized manager can withdraw those collected tokens from Mainnet Smart Vault to distribute them accordingly as bribes, to the DAO and to veBAL holders.

Also, it is important to mention that at all times the DAO has full ownership and control of all three Smart Vault’s assets. This means that, for example, at any moment it can remove permissions to execute an action or withdraw any asset by itself.

# 4. Technical Specification

There will be three Smart Vaults. One deployed in Mainnet, another in Polygon and the last one in Arbitrum. All Smart Vaults will have a single owner who has full control over them at all times. 

Each Smart Vault will be configured with a series of predefined actions, some of those will be automatically executed by Mimic network of bots and others manually by an authorized manager that Balancer DAO designates. Those actions are:

- **Gather and convert to USDC:** Gathers assets (expect from BAL and BAL-like assets) from Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector and swaps them to USDC (except from USDC itself).
- **Gather and convert to BAL:** Gathers BAL and BAL-like assets from Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector and swaps them to BAL (except from BAL itself).
- **Bridge:** Bridges USDC and BAL to Mainnet every two weeks.
- **Withdraw:** Withdraws any asset to an external wallet configured by the owner.

Note that all this behavior will be enforced by smart contracts code, actions won’t be allowed to perform any further logic.

In case external conditions change, the deployed infrastructure can be adjusted as necessary on an ongoing basis to reach the endowment’s objectives. Smart Vaults provide full flexibility to add new allow-listed actions, change permissions or incorporate new strategies. 

More information here: [https://docs.mimic.fi/general/how-it-works](https://docs.mimic.fi/general/how-it-works)

# 5. Operational details

## 5.1. Reporting

Mimic offers a reporting site where users can follow all their Smart Vaults activity. Mimic also supports subscribing to a notifications service that can be easily integrated with some chat rooms like Discord. Additionally, users can subscribe to be notified with periodic reports that will be emitted by Mimic automatically. 

## 5.2. Maintenance

Mimic will be in charge of monitoring the Smart Vaults on a daily basis, making sure the reporting tools are kept up-to-date accordingly. Additionally, Mimic will make use of its own bots infrastructure to execute the automated actions when needed. 

In case a critical report is received, Mimic will act immediately in order to assess its severity and act accordingly. In case Smart Vaults assets are at risk, Mimic team will get in touch with the trusted committee either to pause the Smart Vaults operations until it can be migrated to a new implementation with the corresponding fixes.

## 5.3. Fees

Mimic will charge a 2% fee of the assets that are processed through the Smart Vaults with a 5K USD cap for every period of execution (two weeks).

## 5.4. Termination

As mentioned before Balancer DAO will be in full control of its Smart Vaults and the funds that were deposited into them. This means Balancer DAO is allowed to exit at any point in time. Neither Mimic nor anyone else, unless it was previously allowed by the Balancer DAO, will be never in control of those funds.

# 6. Timeline

Once the final details of the Balancer Smart Vaults are finalized, the Mimic team will take full responsibility to set up the required automated actions. Mimic already counts with infrastructure to deploy and test Smart Vaults that can be applied for this use case.

Assuming the proposed investment strategies and automated actions are accepted by Balancer DAO, setting three Smart Vaults for it shouldn’t take longer than a month. After that, we will schedule an audit process for the configuration before the deployment which shouldn’t take more than two weeks.

148,"### [Proposal]

[Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) connects Web2 to Web3 through the use of blockchain domains. Using an Unstoppable Domain allows you to create a blockchain-connected web address similar to a URL — such as SomeName.crypto or SomeName.zil for example — that translates a cryptocurrency wallet's addresses into a far simpler human-readable name that connects with dApps and exchanges.

Unstoppable Domains has over 2.5M domains registered, supports over 275 coins/tokens, and has over 450 integrations with other apps in its constantly growing ecosystem.

### [Proposed integration]

In addition to providing users with human-readable wallet addresses, Unstoppable Domains also features an SSO-type decentralized universal Web3 login that can be integrated into any dApp.

The proposed integration would add Unstoppable Domains as an option to the wallet connect dialog of the Aave app.

[Read more about Login with Unstoppable](https://dappradar.com/blog/unstoppable-domains-introduces-a-universal-web3-login)

### [Current and proposed integration of Aave in the Unstoppable Domains ecosystem]

Due to Unstoppable Domains' large and ever-growing user base, many current Aave users would likely already benefit from having this additional option to connect their wallet with the app. This number is bound to only go up in the future.

In addition, Unstoppable Domains can help more people find their way to Aave by listing the application on our website, as well as providing other co-marketing options, including but not limited to an announcement on our Twitter (280k followers), by resharing Aave posts/tweets, adding Aave as a partner on our main webpage, and adding information about Aave and our partnership to our newsletter (300k audience).

149,"## Summary

Proposal to add gauge support for the pool WETH/LUSD/LQTY on Ethereum with a 10% emission cap.

- WETH 33.34%
- LUSD 33.33%
- LQTY 33.33%

## References/Useful links:

> New users are limited to 2 links per post... You'll find the link to all relevant resources [here](https://gov.curve.fi/t/proposal-to-whitelist-liquity-s-treasury-multisig-contract/4057)

## Protocol Description

Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD - a USD-pegged stablecoin and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.

In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. User’s borrowing against their ETH use decentralized 3rd party front ends. 

LUSD has proved its impeccable resilience in time by getting through severe market crashes untroubled.

LQTY is the secondary token issued by Liquity. It captures the fee revenue that is generated by the system. 

Liquity is the only lending service available in DeFi that is unstoppable & likewise, LUSD is the only stablecoin capable of resisting all kinds of censorship. Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free. No person or group has any control over the protocol — it is “set in stone” in smart contract code and can never be changed.

Number 1 on DeFi Safety

Liquity is the DeFi product with the highest process quality in the space, according to DeFi Safety. 

## Motivation

To summarize, LUSD is the Liquity protocol stablecoin. It uses ETH only as collateral. And LQTY is the secondary token issued by Liquity, capturing the fee revenue. Furthermore, LQTY stakers earn ETH and LUSD as rewards. And LUSD Stability pool depositors that earn LQTY and ETH. 

So there is already an established demand for the WETH/LUSD/LQTY pool. And even during the bear current market, the demand for Liquity has not diminished. On the contrary, since the mid-June market crash:

* $LUSD market cap went up from $150M to $185M (23%+ increase)
* Troves went up from 473 to 852 (80%+ increase)
* The number of $LQTY and $LUSD holders is also steadily growing in time
* Liquity is now no. 14 in TVL for DeFi protocols on Ethereum

There are two main reasons behind the growing demand. The first one is the recent events with collapsing centralized lending entities that have lost users’ funds and trust. An increasing number of them now choose Liquity, which offers no counterparty risk. 

The recently introduced Chicken Bonds are the second main reason for the increased interest in Liquity. LUSD Chicken Bonds offer an amplified yield-earning and trading opportunity for LUSD holders while helping to reduce the stablecoin premium and improve its liquidity. It has attracted 50m+ TVL in its first 50 days. 

In conclusion, the WETH/LUSD/LQTY pool should attract significant interest in the Balancer community. Besides, the recent release of LUSD Chicken Bonds further increased the demand for such a pool.

![lusdGauge.png](ipfs://bafkreiackrncb6c2miy5skuoirlug7t5nw2bhcvuelx5nq4bfdjzma62oy)
    
## Specifications

1. **Governance**: Liquity has no governance. It is built to maximize trustlessness and decentralization. 
2. **Oracles**: Chainlink is Liquity’s primary oracle. They are the largest player in the oracle space, have an excellent track record, are sufficiently decentralized, and are constantly improving their systems. 

    Tellor is Liquity’s secondary (fallback) oracle. They’re fully decentralized — price data is requested, with a “tip” attached — and miners compete to push accurate data and win the tip. Inaccurate data is disputed, and the threat of stake-slashing incentivizes honest price reporting

3. **Audits**: Multiple security audits have been conducted by various auditors. All relevant documents are available in the documentation. Additionally, Liquity runs a bug bounty program with Hats Finance. 
4. **Centralization vectors**: There are no centralization vectors. Liquity is built to have maximized resilience. 
5. **Market History**: Over the last months, we have observed a premium on LUSD results from a structural unbalance between offer and demand. It was further aggravated by recent events leading more and more users to worry about the censorability of centralized stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) and decentralized stablecoins primarily backed by centralized ones (like DAI or FRAX). 

    The situation led to a considerable demand surge for censorship-resistant stablecoins that only LUSD can answer since there is no other alternative with a significant TVL. Thus, we have seen LUSD trading at a premium and slightly above the peg, partially caused by the increased demand for LUSD. Nevertheless, hard peg mechanisms are built into the system between $1 and $1.10, and soft peg incentives in between. Further, Chicken Bonds are already helping to reduce the stablecoin premium, and this effect will strengthen as the protocol grows. 


    You can check here the historical data of LUSD and LQTY

6. **Value**: There is a proven in-time demand for WETH/LUSD/LQTY and the pool will be stable and beneficial for the Balancer community.

THX Network requests to whitelist its Gnosis Safe multisig address to enable it to lock B-80BAL-20WETH into veBAL and participate in governance and gauge voting.

# Motivation

THX Network allows creators and communities to create and embed ERC20 and ERC721 tokens in their platforms and social channels. The project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under agreement No 82888 (Blockpool) and No 824509 (Block.IS).

$THX is the project’s governance token launched in dec. 2021 using a Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) and has its main source of liquidity on Balancer’s Polygon deployment (~$900k TVL).

Our emerging DAO is about to diversify its treasury into $BAL and participate in Balancer’s governance.

155,"## Overview:

Scope: Reactivate all Badger Smart Contracts to enable recoverable funds to be transferred from the attackers wallets to the DAO recovered funds multi sig.

## TL;DR:

The approval of [BIP-76](https://snapshot.org/#/badgerdao.eth/proposal/0xd3360ea2f5e101b01ad3c80d04f2abeb38f8faee2ebba1ca791e8c1b360b7d7b) has allowed for the upgrading of the protocol smart contracts. BIP-77 will not be enacted until actions described in BIP-76 have completed. The next step in the process of fund recovery is the reactivation of all smart contracts to facilitate the proposed rescue.

## Approval of BIP-77 achieves the below:

- Reactivate the protocol smart contracts
- Execute the stolen funds recovery scripts
- Develop clarity on multisig permissions within the DAO (specifically, the dev multisig)

## Explanation Of Choices:

- Approve: Unpause all contracts, recover stolen funds to DAO recovered funds multisig, and give permission to multisig to unpause in the future without a BIP
- Approve Without Precedent: Unpause all contracts, recover stolen funds to DAO recovered funds multisig, but require BIPs for any future unpausing events
- Deny: Keep all contracts paused and do not recover stolen funds

Related Discussion: Our proposal is similar to [Voltz Additional Use Grant](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/should-uniswap-provide-voltz-with-v3-additional-use-grant/15669)

### What is Rage Trade?

[Rage Trade](https://rage.trade) is a new perpetual swap  protocol built using Uniswap v3. Many on-chain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs. However, traders and LPs benefit from v3’s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp.

### Why do we need an additional use grant?

Our proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol. Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3’s code but instead we have built on top of it. Think of Uniswap as our matching engine, and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading. We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswap’s core: leverage trading, leverage LPing, cross-margin, liquidations, and real time funding rates. 

### What changes have we made that require additional use?

We have built libraries to enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates. Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswap’s BUSL protect code (that we require an additional grants use for):

- [SimulateSwap](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/SimulateSwap.sol): This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage. It makes use of Uniswap’s TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries.
- [TickBitmapExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickBitmapExtended.sol): This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswap's TickBitmap, required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract.
- [TickExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickExtended.sol): This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade. They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3.
- [LiquidityPosition](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/LiquidityPosition.sol#L5): This library enables leverage liquidity providing (and the accompanying margin logic). It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so.


 ### How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap?

1. Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3: Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 (not a fork) all additional TVL + trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3.

2. Rage Trade will spend significant R&D resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie: Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 80-20 strategy that composes with Curve’s tricrypto.

3. Liquid & composable on-chain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies: Using perps, Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging. Additionally multi-collateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market. 

### Conclusion

Rage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswap’s value as a protocol. We look forward to discussing our proposal with the Uniswap community and answering questions in the comments below.",bullish

## Title : [ARFC] wGHO Aave V3 Onboarding

## Author : Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs

## Date: 2023-09-15
---
## Summary

This proposal aims to onboard wGHO, an ERC-20 token wrapper of GHO, as a collateral-only asset in a newly created stablecoin emode within the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.

## Motivation

The onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.

This integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.

Alongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.

It's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.

wGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. 

## Specification

The ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:

- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset & isolation mode asset.
- wGHO parameters:

| LTV | 77% |
| --- | --- |
| LT | 80%  |
| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |
| Supply Cap | 1M |
| Borrow Cap | 0 |
| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |

### Note:

wGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.

Onboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.

## Disclaimer

The Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The he author have both large GHO debt & GHO holdings. The ACI uses GHO to fund the [Orbit program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241).

## Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback and consensus on this ARFC.
2. Escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot Stage.
3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE approved, escalate to AIP stage.

165,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)    
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)   
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BSC etc.

# What is the new IFO 3.0 Format?

Stake, stake, stake! Starting with this IFO, your max CAKE commitment limit for the IFO will be set by your average IFO pool staking balance during the calculation period (approx. 7 days from 14-21 Dec 21). For more details, check out our [**Medium post**](https://medium.com/pancakeswap/initial-farm-offering-ifo-3-0-ifo-staking-pool-622d8bd356f1) to learn more!

# What is Diviner Protocol?
 
**Diviner Protocol** aims to build up a metaverse “Diviner Harbor City” to offer users a lossless & gamified prediction marketplace by combining the best of DeFi and NFTs.

# What is $DPT? 

$DPT is the governance token as well as the in-game currency of Diviner Protocol.

# $DPT Token Distribution

![](https://i.imgur.com/UeH5gqW.png)

Following the IFO, approximately 5.1% of the total supply will be circulating in the market.

# IFO Sales Details  
- **Sale start time:** Approx. 100pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21
- **Sale end time:** Approx. 130pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21
- **Amount to be raised:** $600,000 USD in **CAKE tokens**
- **Tokens to be sold:** 24,000,000 DPT (2.4% of initial DPT total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 DPT = $0.025 USD
All CAKE raised from the DPT token sale will be given to the IFO project. Only CAKE raised from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Basic Sale and Unlimited Sale (via the Overflow method), with Commitment Limit determined by IFO Credits.

# What is the new IFO CAKE Pool?

TLDR: Stake CAKE in the IFO CAKE pool, and get higher IFO allocations!

From 14-21 Dec 21 (IFO CAKE Pool Calculation Period), every CAKE staked in the IFO CAKE Pool counts towards your CAKE Credit Calculation. Stake more CAKE, receive more IFO Credits, and get higher IFO allocations! [**More details here**](https://medium.com/pancakeswap/initial-farm-offering-ifo-3-0-ifo-staking-pool-622d8bd356f1).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

TLDR: The more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent.

In the “Overflow” method, users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the IFO, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale.

# To participate in the IFO:

#### Before Sale:
- [**Create an active PancakeSwap profile**](https://pancakeswap.finance/profile)
- [**Buy CAKE tokens**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/swap)

#### During Sale:

While the sale is live (100pm – 130pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21), commit your CAKE tokens to buy DPT tokens at [*pancakeswap.finance/ifo*](https://pancakeswap.finance/ifo).

#### After Sale:

When the sale is complete, claim your DPT tokens and your unspent funds will also be sent back to you.

Done!

If you decide to acquire CAKE tokens before the IFO starts, you can stake them [***here***](https://pancakeswap.finance/pools) to earn CAKE token rewards while waiting for the sale.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Basic Sale ($180,000, which is 30% of Sale allocation)

In the “Basic” session, each person can contribute a MAXIMUM of $100 equivalent in CAKE tokens.

Note that the final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session, but the good news is you’re not battling any whales.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZkcXSvt.png)

#### Unlimited Sale ($420,000, which is 70% of Sale Allocation)

The “Unlimited” session has no limits on the amount each person can contribute. However, this comes at the cost of a participation fee.

How much is the participation fee?

There is a 1% participation fee which decreases in cliffs, based on the percentage of overflow from the “Unlimited” portion of the sale.

The fee cliff is as follows:


**Overflow multiplier**

![](https://i.imgur.com/qH3hylcm.png)


In the “Unlimited Sale” method, users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the IFO, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale.


![](https://i.imgur.com/a4syJ9Z.png)

Please note — The final USD price per CAKE token will be set a few minutes before the sale (starting at approx. 100pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21) and will be broadcasted on all channels.

A Syrup Pool and Farm for Diviner Protocol will also run at the conclusion of the IFO.

# The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn DPT!

- **Total Tokens:** 8,000,000 DPT
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends
- **Finish time:** Approx. 60 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 4.629 DPT

# The Farm:

In order to host the DPT Syrup Pool, we will need to provide a DPT-BNB farm that will have 2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours and then 1x CAKE rewards after that.

171,"##### ABSTRACT
The Made By Apes program is fantastic, but there isn’t enough exposure for the builders pushing our ecosystem forward. I’m seeking funds to produce a series of short documentaries highlighting MBA businesses and the networking that ties apes, ApeCoin, the DAO and MBAs together.

For the core of the series, I will travel to 3 major hubs for MBAs: LA, NYC and Miami, filming 3-5 businesses and a networking event in each city. Each featured business & meetup will have its own approximately 5-10 minute long episode and a short teaser. The first episode will debut about 1 month after shooting begins, with a new episode released every 3-4 weeks.

I will feature MBAs from many industries and show a variety of use cases and business strategies. Small boutiques like Frens Chocolate and international brands like Bored & Hungry have compelling stories, as do projects with existing links to ApeCoin such as the Bored Brewing Company, Aaron Haber’s Laughing Ape, and the Bored Ape Gazette, a potential distribution partner for this series. The Bored Trading Co’s unique model helps smaller MBAs distribute products at events across the world, an example of the synergy being created every day by apes, MBAs & the ApeCoin DAO, something that deserves far more attention. An episode featuring Horizen’s launch of ApeChain would be a unique opportunity to take control of the narrative and show tangible community and business utility within the ApeCoin DAO & BAYC.

As a gesture of my commitment, I’m proposing that full ownership of the completed pieces along with any streaming and distribution revenue belong to the DAO itself. Also, I will only work on this project for the entire term, collaborating with apes every step of the way, from selecting featured MBAs to hiring apes for music and organizing MBA meetups.
I’ve believed in BAYC’s potential as a modern social club since the day I minted. This series will celebrate the businesses and social capital being created by MBAs with the help of apes and the ApeCoin DAO.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
This series aligns with the ApeCoin DAO’s mission to foster community led projects that drive culture forward into the metaverse. Entrepreneurship and IP have been a part of BAYC’s culture since the beginning, and Made By Apes is the next evolution. This series will bring much needed exposure to ApeCoin funded projects, highlighting the DAO’s impact in the real world and showing various ways apes have integrated BAYC into their own expressions of culture, from food & beverage to arts & entertainment.

By showcasing successful MBA & ApeCoin projects, it will:
* Add to the sense of professionalism & community in the ApeCoin DAO by showcasing skilled creatives & entrepreneurs, including those who have already received ApeCoin funding.
* Potentially increase demand for ApeCoin & ApeChain by demonstrating their ties to the BAYC community and showcasing real-world use cases for the tokens.
* Show outsiders that BAYC is more than just a jpg one can right click ‘n save, but rather a passionate community of skilled entrepreneurs building in the real world across industries.
* Educate apes on how they can leverage the MBA program for their own pursuits, providing concrete examples and inspiration for those looking to commercialize their IP or use ApeCoin in their projects.
* Provide valuable exposure for the featured projects and the apes behind them, promoting their ventures and attracting new customers or even potential investors.
* Show the power of networking & diversity of skills in BAYC to foster more collaboration within the community, and facilitate IRL networking via the meetups in each city.
* Attract new members to the BAYC & ApeCoin communities by highlighting the unique opportunities for IP commercialization and the supportive nature of the ape community & DAO, both online and in real life.

By providing a behind-the-scenes look at the innovative ways apes are utilizing their IP, the Made By Apes series has the potential to drive growth and engagement for the entire BAYC ecosystem.

##### OVERALL COST 
Total amount requested from the ApeCoin DAO = $141,600 USD, to be paid in ApeCoin.
* LA - 2 weeks; flight, hotel & car = ~$3,000
* NYC - 2 weeks; flight, hotel & car = ~7,000
* Miami - 2 weeks; flight, hotel & car = ~$3,000
* ApeFest - 1 week; flight, hotel & car = ~$3,000
* Music Licensing & Scoring - $20,000

I will bill my time at $60 / hour, less than industry standard, equivalent to $9600 per month. It’s hard to estimate exactly how long a project like this will take to complete, but on the high end, rounding up to 11 months, my salary would be $105,600. Combined with the travel budget of $16,000 and music budget of $20,000 we reach a total of $141,600 for 11 months of production covering at least 4 major cities (NYC, Miami, LA, Lisbon).

A proposal to make parameter changes on Ethereum v3. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-for-weth-uopt-on-ethereum-v3/14802).


## Motivation

[AIP-306](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/306/) to onboard sDAI also increased WETH Uopt from 80% to 90%. After analysis, Gauntlet recommends returning WETH Uopt to 80%. Currently, there may be insufficient WETH to facilitate liquidations during increased volatility - this proposal aims to increase the available WETH for liquidations should utilization for WETH be at Uopt = kink.


## Specification

# Summary

* This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for pxETH/frxETH on Arbitrum.
* The underlying pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP). E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.
* The pool shall has a swap fee of 4 basis points, i.e., 0.04% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.

**Protocol Description:**

> pxETH is a liquid and fungible receipt token for ETH deposited into the Dinero protocol. pxETH is built on top of the Redacted DAO's Pirex platform and forms an integral part of Redacted’s Dinero protocol, a protocol which aims to vertically integrate ETH staking, block proposal and building, a RPC, leverage, and yield stripping into one synergistic ecosystem comprising pxETH, the Redacted Relayer RPC, and the DINERO stablecoin. pxETH provides users with a liquid and fungible tokenized staked ETH which benefits from Ethereum staking rewards and other revenue forms such as MEV tips and block rewards. Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).

In addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.

pxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.

The governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.

**Motivation:**

> Redacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.

An LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.

By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:

* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.

* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.

Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps 1

# Specifications

## Governance

The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.

## Oracles

No oracles are currently used.

## Audits

Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.

## Centralization vectors

No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.

## Market History

The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available[ here 1](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).

## Value

As per “Motivation”.

185,"**Title: [ARFC] GHO Steward: Agile Parameter Changes**

**Author: [@AaveCompanies](https://governance.aave.com/u/aavecompanies)**

**Date: 12th July 2023**

## **Summary**

This ARFC proposes implementing the dedicated GHO Steward as a dynamic parameter change mechanism to ensure efficient risk management and support the peg of Aave Protocol’s native multi-collateral stablecoin GHO during the initial stages.

## **Motivation**

### **Introduction**

As the Aave DAO prepares for the introduction of GHO, it is crucial for the community to consider implementing a mechanism that offers greater agility to adjust risk parameters in the initial stages of launch.

To support the maintenance of the peg, the proposed GHO Steward multisig acts as a dynamic parameter change mechanism. It enables swift adjustments to risk parameters in the form of scoped governance delegation where the full governance process could potentially be time-consuming and hinder timely response to evolving circumstances.

By employing this mechanism, the Aave Protocol ensures transparency and enables flexible parameter changes through decentralized governance. This approach reinforces commitment to preserving the peg and effectively addressing market challenges that may arise upon the launch of GHO.

### **Key Terms**

The “bucket capacity” refers to the maximum amount of GHO that can be minted by a Facilitator. The ability to adapt the bucket capacity by adjusting supply supports stability by ensuring that available supply meets demand.

The “borrow rate” refers to the interest rate paid when borrowing GHO. The borrowing rate may also be used to support stability because of its impact on demand.

You can learn more about GHO in the docs [here](https://docs.gho.xyz/).

### **GHO Steward Permissions**

Aave V3 provides a high level of granularity around permissions. Building on the concept of [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/4), it is proposed that a dedicated GHO Steward multisig be introduced to support the initial GHO governance risk mechanism to enable the implementation of agile parameter changes in the form of scoped governance delegation.

The GHO Steward multisig would be 2/2 and would include the DAO’s risk providers Chaos Labs and Gauntlet.

The GHO Steward would be capable of adjusting predefined parameters including: increasing the bucket capacity (by up to 100%) and changing the borrow rate (by up to 100 basis points in either direction) in a single change. Parameter updates could only occur once every 5 days per the parameter.

It is proposed that the GHO Steward would be deactivated 90 days after the passing of this proposal. However, the DAO can vote to renew the GHO Steward for another 90 days if deemed necessary. The DAO can also vote to remove the GHO Steward at any time.

### **Governance Process**

This proposal emphasizes the importance of decentralization and community involvement in the decision-making process, fostering a robust and inclusive ecosystem. The GHO Risk Steward would enable agile parameter changes for GHO; however, decisions shouldn’t be made in isolation and should go through a lean governance process.

The proposed lean process is as follows:

1. Proposal on the Governance Forum explaining the rationale of the proposed action.
2. Snapshot requirements:
    
    a. 24-hour duration starting from the posting of the proposal
    
    b. Quorum 250,000 AAVE
    
    c. A minimum of 70% of votes FOR the change
    
3. Change can be enacted as soon as the proposal passes Snapshot.

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the GHO Steward serves as an initial agile parameter change mechanism driven by decentralized governance. It highlights the Aave Protocol’s commitment to maintaining GHO stability and addressing market challenges during the launch period.

While the proposal acknowledges the potential for a more dynamic rate-changing governance model in the future, the current framework allows the DAO to effectively manage GHO’s parameters in the short term.

## **Specification**

### **Capabilities:**

1. **Capacity Increase:** It can increase the bucket capacity by up to 100%. This is strictly an upward adjustment; the capacity cannot be decreased by the GHO Steward.
2. **Borrow Rate Adjustment:** It can adjust the borrow rate by up to 1%, either upwards or downwards.

### **Configuration:**

1. **Permissions:** The GHO Steward is granted PoolAdmin in the Aave Protocol and BucketManager for the GHO token.
2. **Risk Council:** This Multisig is solely responsible for triggering actions through the GHO Steward contract. The address of this entity cannot be changed.
3. **Execution Time Delay:** Any parameter change made by the GHO Steward contract, such as increasing bucket capacity or adjusting the borrow rate, is limited to once within the time delay period. e.g.,GHO Steward can only change a parameter once 5 days have passed since the last parameter change for that specific parameter.
4. **Lifespan:** The GHO Steward contract will initially only have a lifespan of 90 days. The lifespan is designed to ensure regular review of the necessity of this approach.
5. **Steward Lifespan Extension:** The DAO can extend the lifespan of the GHO Steward for additional 90-day periods as many times as it wants.

Abstract:

We propose that Messari provides research and reporting services for Venus in the form of quarterly reports. This will serve to better inform existing stakeholders and attract new ones while building out the open-source data infrastructure for the community.

About Messari:

Messari is a team of crypto natives passionate about building powerful data analytics tools for the Web3 world. The company was started in early 2018 and has since scaled to over 150 employees after raising a Series B led by Brevan Howard. We’ve also received a grant from The Graph to become a core developer. It has allowed us to build and standardize subgraphs, creating a robust open-source data infrastructure for the broader crypto ecosystem.

Messari is functionally split into two distinct units:

● Messari Enterprise, a paywalled market intelligence platform that operates like a traditional SaaS business.
● Messari Protocol Services, which provides research and reporting services on behalf of protocols and DAOs. The entirety of the work from the underlying data infrastructure to the reports themselves are open sourced and publicly available. Therefore, the work is sustained based on grants from projects whether through the development team, grants program, or DAO treasury funding.

This proposal is coming on behalf of Messari Protocol Services.

Commitment to transparency

Funding this type of reporting demonstrates a proactive commitment by Venus to transparency and accountability, two core tenets of this industry. Doing so sends positive signals to prospective users, clients, and partners. Additionally, our work with regulators in DC has made it clear that this type of transparency is looked upon favorably and highlights decentralization by working with third-party service providers to execute crucial functions.

Pricing & Resources

(4) Quarterly Reports ($23,750/quarter)

(1) Enterprise License ($8,000/annual) *Comped

Total: $95,000

Which goes towards funding:

Research

Our analysts spend several weeks researching and writing each report, along with an extensive internal editing and review process by the broader team.

Data Science and Engineering

Each report will have its own dedicated data science and engineering resources tasked with providing all the relevant raw data. This requires ingesting large amounts of data which is housed in a data warehouse, incurring storage and compute costs.

Distribution

We have several members of the team working on distribution for these reports across all of Messari’s channels along with the third-party partners.

MY TELEGRAM: https://t.me/dogehacker (@dogehacker)


It all started about 3 years ago. I started my introduction to the world of cryptocurrencies. I had a great job, enough money to save. I was lucky, I made a lot of money, on the best days my profit was around $10,000. That's when I decided to lock up some of it for a long period of time.

But all good things come to an end. Now I'm in the hospital, I have a lot of unpaid bills and a hacked wallet with my tokens.

At first I thought I would just sell my steaking to an acquaintance for 50% of the value to cover my loans. But we discovered that my wallet had been hacked. Since I am a developer and have a lot of experience in WEB3 I realize that I can bypass the sweeper.

Now there is a very important question. Is there any possibility to ask you for help?

There are several solutions:

We will reach the management of pancake, they will allow me to withdraw earlier, even if at 100% loss of rewards

Users who can help - donate funds to me, and I extend steaking for a year and give the private wallet key to you

Please don't think I'm a beggar. I just happen to have a problem. If you have any questions, you are welcome to ask. I'll be able to back up what I say!

Thank you for reading the text. My wallet: 0x98d795c04a30564da1d7521f508d84e93ba6295d. Would be glad to have your support. If I get enough YES votes here, I will write a second part where I will describe everything in more detail

Stay safe! Pancake dao above all!

189,"#### Revised: PancakeSwap Welcomes CyberConnect ($CYBER) to Farms!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Farm with CyberConnect! 

CyberConnect is a Web3 social network that provides developers with the capability to create social applications. These applications allow users to own their digital identity, content, connections, and interactions.

In order to improve trading conditions and CAKE buyback, we are introducing CAKE emission to the current CyberConnect Liquidity Pool - CYBER-BNB on BNB Chain.

By introducing CAKE emission to CYBER-BNB on BNB Chain, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.


The farm multiplier of this revised proposal has been adjusted to ensure **CAKE is distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner for CAKE holders.**

#### The Farm:

Stake CYBER-BNB (0.25% fee tier) v3 LP to earn CAKE tokens!

- Farm duration: 30 days
- Farm base multiplier: **up to** 12x
- Liquidity pair: CYBER-BNB (0.25% fee tier) v3 pair
- Start time: Approx. 0900 UTC on 18 Aug 2023
- Finish time: Approx. 0900 UTC on 17 Sep 2023 


During the 30-day farm period, we request for flexibility in the farm multiplier - we will start with **8x** CAKE rewards and will adjust the multipliers as appropriate to enable optimal trading conditions, up to a **maximum** of 12x. 

At the end of the 30-day period, the farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $CYBER?

CYBER is the name of CyberConnect governance token. There are multiple utilities for CYBER token such as:
- Participate in the governance directly or by delegating their votes
- Used for payment when minting CyberConnect’s ERC-721 NFT handle (CyberID).
- Used as means of payment for gas fees for all transactions while interacting with CyberConnect’s smart contracts (CyberAccount)

190,"The PEPE team would like to suggest adding support for PEPE on Venus as a collateral asset in a MEME Pool on BNB Chain Isolated markets. The addition of PEPE as an asset for lending and borrowing would create fees, flexibility, yields and other opportunities for Venus users, especially those interested in accumulating more PEPE.

The fundamentals of PEPEs growth are unprecedented. PEPE has been listed on leading global exchanges and has exceeded records of every token in it’s class that has come before it.

Motivation

PEPE continues to further decentralize itself, crossing borders and breaking records with volume and adoption. Adding PEPE to Venus will increase demand for PEPE and expand yield opportunities in new markets on Venus.

With such incredible retail distribution, CEX distribution and multi chain distribution, PEPE is a unicorn level event.

Benefits

This unlocks new DeFi possibilities for PEPE token holders as they can use their PEPE tokens as collateral in the Venus Isolated Markets to access liquidity. Venus will also tap into PEPEs rapidly growing network.

192,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes pSTAKE ($PSTAKE) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with pSTAKE! 

Developed by Persistence, pSTAKE is a multi-chain liquid staking protocol that unlocks the liquidity of proof-of-stake assets by issuing staked representative tokens (e.g. stkBNB) against users’ bonded assets, allowing them to earn DeFi yields on top of staking rewards. It is currently live on Cosmos, Ethereum, and BNB Chain.

BNB holders can liquid stake their tokens [**here**](https://bnb.pstake.finance/) to mint stkBNB and further use it in the BNB Chain DeFi ecosystem (eg. on PancakeSwap).

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn PSTAKE tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 950,000 PSTAKE
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1300 UTC on 25 Apr 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1300 UTC on 24 Jun 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.5497 PSTAKE

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the PSTAKE Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a **stkBNB-BNB (0.05% fee tier)** and a **PSTAKE-CAKE (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm on BNB Chain.  


The **stkBNB-BNB (0.05% fee tier)** v3 farm will have 12x CAKE rewards, while the **PSTAKE-CAKE (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm will have 4x CAKE rewards for the entire 60 days . At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1300 UTC on 24 Jun 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $PSTAKE?

PSTAKE is the governance token of pSTAKE Finance – PSTAKE holders can participate in the protocol’s governance and protocol improvement proposals to ensure long term security of the protocol. It is also used to align incentives of all the stakeholders within the pSTAKE ecosystem.

#### What is $stkBNB?

stkBNB is the staked representative of BNB issued by pSTAKE that allows for a more secure BNB Chain and higher BNB DeFi yields. Under the hood, the staked BNB is delegated to a robust set of 10 validators that optimizes for APR without compromising security. pSTAKE only charges 5% of fees for liquid staking your BNB. stkBNB has been audited by Peckshield, Halborn, & Certora. An on-chain monitoring system with Forta, bug-bounty on Immunefi, and stress tests by the BNB Chain team add to a secure liquid staking experience.

193,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-extend-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-program-4-weeks/1121).

# The Proposal
The [exchange gas reimbursement pilot](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799) will come to a close at 00:00 UTC on February 22. This proposal seeks to extend the program another four weeks, to end at 00:00 UTC on March 22. We would continue to allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy. It should be noted that three days still remain in the pilot, but at present about 20,000 BAL would still remain from that initial budget, and those tokens should be used toward the 30,000 BAL budget for this extension. The remainder will be taken from the Balancer Ecosystem Fund.

# Motivation
The initial pilot has gone well. During its first 3.5 weeks, a total of 9332 BAL have been issued to 4568 recipients. Of these recipients, only 846 had held BAL before the start of the program, which indicates that distributing governance tokens to traders does indeed improve decentralization of voting power. This decentralization has always been one of the core goals of our liquidity mining program, but that program applies only to liquidity providers and not traders.

There has been some discussion on Discord about extending the program indefinitely, but first we need an opportunity to make refinements and collect more data to gauge the program's effect on core protocol metrics. Over the course of this four-week extension, we should be prepared to make structural modifications to the program (ratified by governance) to improve the user experience, which seems to be holding back many traders from participating. We should also, as a community, make a concerted effort to increase awareness of the program in order to grow the sample size of the data.

# Mechanics
The overarching mechanics of the gas reimbursement pilot would not change. Please see the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705) for details. Also refer to the program's [expansion to all whitelisted tokens](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799), which would remain in effect throughout this extended period.

Swaps between any two of the tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json) would be eligible for reimbursement of gas costs, with limits described in the original post and summarized here:

* Only transactions between an EOA account and the Balancer Exchange Proxy would be eligible. This roughly correlates to end users navigating the [Balancer Exchange UI](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap) and would not include DEX aggregators or most arbitrage bots.
* The maximum amount of gas to be reimbursed would be 100,000 units per swap, where there can be more than one swap in a single transaction (a swap is one leg of a multi-hop trade).
* The maximum gas price (in gwei) used would be the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block.
* Reimbursements would be made in BAL, not ETH, with the median BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko for the weekly period being used to convert.
* If the number of tokens to be distributed in a single week exceeds the 7,500 BAL budget, all reimbursements would be scaled down proportionally so that exactly 7,500 BAL are issued in total. However, there is room for flexibility here: the amount issued through Week N should never exceed N*7500; but if previously unused tokens remain they can be utilized. For example, if only 1,000 BAL are spent in Week 1 but Week 2 requires 10,000 BAL, then 2,500 BAL will be taken from the Week 1 budget and put toward Week 2 so as not to unnecessarily restrict the distribution for that week.
* Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program and the gas reimbursement pilot. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.",bullish
194,"Dear Uniswap Community,

A few weeks ago, Voltz submitted a proposal to request for an “Additional Use Grant” from the Uniswap Community. This would allow Voltz to use aspects of the v3 code that is subject to a “Business Source License”. Voltz recognises the significant R&D that went into v3 and as a result is offering Uniswap Governance 1% of Voltz future tokens, alongside a number of non-financial benefits. The full proposal is available here https://gov.uniswap.org/t/should-uniswap-provide-voltz-with-v3-additional-use-grant/15669?u=simonj

We were delighted and humbled by the response from the Uniswap Community to our Temperature Check vote, with >99% voting in favour of our proposal! The Temperature Check also met the 25k UNI Yes threshold required to pass.  https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x4f42b3215c4028edd947dc69980a9b8ba837ffbe3d0caa60d999406d634c8e79

We’re excited to see how the community votes! And we’re excited to make this happen and set a precedent for DeFi! 


**Voltz TL;DR**

Voltz is a new DeFi primitive, bringing interest rate swaps to DeFi in a manner that is up to 3000x more capital efficient than alternative models. Voltz, therefore, is not a competitor to Uniswap but instead is complementary; interest rate swaps are a core pillar of well-functioning financial systems - so as Voltz grows it should help DeFi grow, which in turn should have second order benefits to Uniswap.",neutral

- Stable Rate Borrowing
- DEX Integration
- New Risk Management
- VAI Stability Fee
- Updated Governance Process
- Tokenomics V3

**Summary:**
Enable a Balancer gauge for ALTR-WETH pool on Ethereum.
ALTR is the token issued by the Alternity Protocol. It captures the fee revenue that is generated by the system.

    • [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xAlternity)

**Protocol Description:**

Alternity is a decentralized protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, inspired by the design of the Liquity Protocol. 

The protocol provide users with a stablecoin that is pegged to the Chinese Yuan, achieved by utilizing Ether as the required collateral. Loans are paid out in LCNY (a CNY pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 110%.

Alternity aims to cater to users who value diversification and seek alternatives to USD-pegged stablecoins.

As a protocol, Alternity is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.

**Motivation:**

Alternity Protocol is addressing the growing demand for a stable, decentralized, and Yuan-pegged financial instrument in the DeFi ecosystem. As the global economy continues to evolve, the need for diverse stablecoin options that cater to various markets becomes more evident.

Recognizing China's growing influence and the rising importance of the Yuan, Alternity offers an alternative solution with a Yuan-pegged stablecoin, providing diversification, risk management, and a more robust DeFi ecosystem.  

Incentivization to this pool will help drive liquidity for users who want to use decentralized and immutable CNY pegged stable in order to diversify their portfolio. Stable diversification will ultimately lead to rather healthier DeFi ecosystem.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Governance free. 

2. **Oracles:**
There are no oracles for ALTR token. 

3. **Audits:** 
Alternity is a Liquity fork that was audited by:
* [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/Liquity.pdf)
* [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/liquity-audit/)

4. **Centralization vectors:** There are no centralization vectors. Alternity and Liquity are built to have maximized resilience.

5. **Market History:** Alternity has limited history, as it is a new protocol in the process of bootstrapping. The protocol was launched on the 19th August 2023 and attracted more than 125 ETH in trove deposits. The success of LUSD has shown interest in this type of assets.
 
6. **Value:** This pool will be the main point of liquidity for ALTR. We will participate in bribe markets and as new project we expect to see a decent amount of swap volume.

The soon to be released Telos EVM will make Telos the only network to support both leading smart contract protocols, EVM and EOSIO.




# The Syrup Pool:
Stake CAKE tokens to earn TLOS tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 625,000 TLOS 
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start block:** #10731700 [**(approx. 9am UTC on September 8th)**](https://www.bscscan.com/block/countdown/10731700)

## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.


# The Farm:
In order to host the TLOS Syrup Pool, we will need to provide a TLOS-BNB farm that will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours and then 0.5x CAKE rewards after that. 


# What is Telos?
**Fast & Scalable blockchain focused on Real World Use and Adoption**
Telos is built for speed and scalability making it the ideal network for mainstream adoption – Telos based Tokens, NFT’s and Smart Contracts are already used for DeFi, Gaming, Social Media apps and so much more. Telos is home to over 100 distinct applications (dApps) including Taikai, Qudo, Qubicles, Appics, Wordproof, Seeds, Zeptagram, and NewLife. These applications enjoy the network’s speed (0.5s block times) and scale (10,000+ TPS) but also the robust on-chain services that Telos provides for voting, sentiment, decentralized file storage, location and much more.
The upcoming Telos EVM (currently on testnet) will be the most performant and most affordable Ethereum Virtual Machine available. When it arrives Telos will be the only blockchain to support the two leading standards EVM and EOSIO for smart contract development.

213,"#### ABSTRACT

A community marketplace is a natural next step for the ApeCoin DAO. A successful community marketplace will: drive adoption of $APE through $APE listings, drive traffic to the ApeCoin DAO (apecoin.com), and decrease fees to community members by building a APE-native marketplace with rich ape-specific user experiences. In order to compete this marketplace must be cost competitive with fees in-line with or lower than competitors like X2Y2.

Our marketplace will host all Yugaverse projects in a single marketplace UI, with dramatically reduced fees, keeping $$ in the BAYC ecosystem and improving the marketplace experience for both buyers and sellers.

While we have a lot to share, some notable key features of the marketplace are the following:

- Leveraging @reservoir0x’s open-source, on-chain orderbook to increase openness and composability.
- Aggregated orders from major marketplaces (OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, Sudoswap, and more) to maintain a strong bridge to the rest of the NFT market.
- Native sales in $APE with no fees to users buying and selling in $APE.
- A .5% marketplace fee on $ETH listings and a .25% fee in $APE. .25% of all fees will be sent to a community-held multi-sig wallet on a monthly cadence. The use of funds can then be decided in a separate AIP. (more on why later) The .25% from $ETH will be converted to $APE and sent to the wallet.
- Development of contextual and ape-specific marketplace functionality, such as integration of key BAYC metadata, relation to the Otherside, and more.

220,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708)

### Summary

This proposal is to whitelist [Aura Finance](0) in Balancer’s [VotingEscrow](1) contract allowing Aura Finance to lock `BAL` (in the form of [80/20 BAL/WETH BPT](3)), participate in Balancer governance, and provide additional rewards to Balancer ecosystem participants without immediate disposal of `BAL` rewards.

### Abstract

Aura Finance is a protocol built on top of the Balancer system to provide maximum incentives to Balancer LPs and `BAL` stakers through social aggregation of `$BAL` deposits and Aura’s native token `$AURA` .

For BAL stakers, Aura provides a seamless onboarding process to `veBAL` , by creating a tokenised wrapper token called `auraBAL` that represents the 80/20 BPT locked up for the maximum time in VotingEscrow. This can be staked to receive existing rewards ( `$BAL` and `bbaUSD` revenue) from Balancer, in addition to Aura system revenue in the form of `$BAL` , and additional `$AURA` . Users can trade their `auraBAL` back to `BAL` at any time through a deep StablePool BPT.

For Liquidity providers, Aura abstracts away complexity of the Balancer gauge boosting system, providing a smooth onboarding process to all Balancer gauge deposits. Aura allows depositors to achieve a high boost through the protocol owned `veBAL` while also accumulating additional `$AURA` rewards.

`BAL` locked in Aura will be taken out of circulation “Ad vitam æternam”. Being aligned with the DAO is our goal, with this implementation seeking to be fully symbiotic.

### $AURA & Governance

Aura Finance also proposes the `$AURA` token to act as a governance and incentivisation tool within the ecosystem. Locked `AURA` tokens will have governance rights in the system and will be able to vote using the protocol owned `veBAL` voting power. The goal of `$AURA` is to create a flourishing ecosystem on top of Balancer.

***With great power comes great responsibility***... The protocol is expected to control a large stake of the veBAL voting power. This has a huge economic power as it effectively controls the flow of Balancer incentives over the next 20 years. It is therefore important that this control is fully decentralized. Aura has added vote delegation to the system to allow this to take place fully on chain. Once the voter base has sufficiently matured, control will be passed from the starting 4 of 7 multisig, to a suite of on chain contracts.

The Aura Voting contract has support for [EIP1271](4) meaning that the results of on chain votes can be forwarded to [Snapshot](5) to participate in Balancer governance. This transition should take place as soon as the Aura voting contracts are battle tested and the voter base has matured (~3-4 months post launch).

***Amuse Bouche*** - Without giving too much details, here is a quick overview of high level `AURA` distribution:

- 50% Balancer LP rewards Rewarded pro-rata for BAL received on Aura
- 10% for StableSwap auraBAL/BPT over 4 years
- 5% for Aura/ETH incentives
- 17.5% Treasury vested
- 2.5% bootstrapping token holder base*
- 1% for future incentives
- **2% BAL treasury over 2 years**
- **2% system bootstrapping incentives**
- 10% for the Aura team over 2 years
- **100% Fair launched no VC - Seed investors**

*Voting positively on the allowlist proposal will have an additional 2-3x boost in the bootstrapping phase based on their BAL balance

The release schedule for AURA is thus depicted as follows:

![auradistro|592x344](upload://21ihgMbtLLSPir0mG0ipkW8LlMp.png)

### Team

The Aura team comprises DeFi builders and pioneers with a track record of delivering.

Aura Finance is currently undergoing an audit with Peckshield, and is planning to conduct two further audits with top tier firms.

### Proposal specification

It is proposed that the Balancer multisig add a smart wallet checker on the `veBAL` contract, and subsequently whitelist the depositor contract provided by Aura Finance following a successful proposal. The Balancer team would manually review this contract before whitelisting.

In the interests of keeping Aura 100% fair launch and with no VCs, it is also proposed that the Balancer treasury DAO provide the Aura treasury with a $300k grant in order to reimburse for audit costs and to be spent on further security (e.g. codearena).

**SPEC**

Allowlist the following contract on the veBAL smart_wallet_checker once available: [`0xaf52695e1bb01a16d33d7194c28c42b10e0dbec2`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaf52695e1bb01a16d33d7194c28c42b10e0dbec2)

======

RPL appears to be a coin with a purpose and a real use case.
The $26,465,785 70 RPL - 30 WETH pool is one of the biggest on Balancer and earns BAL at a rate of $10m worth of BAL/year.

Unfortunately it generates very little volume with 24h volumes oscilating in low tens of thousands of USD, last 24h volume: $30,891

A $2m pool would be enough to facilitate low slippage trading for such volumes so I propose reducing the BAL rewards cap to reduce from 10m *to 3m*. I think that the $10m yearly worth of rewards could be used to encourage other, more useful liquidity.

On top of the low trading volumes and low interest from traders, my subjective opinion is that the valuation is artificially inflated, I’m not happy about heavy concentration of this pool in hands of a single liquidity provider (90% single LP, recently >97%). CMC shows that this coin trades >$900k on Bilaxy and >300k on LBank within 24h which I find hard to believe. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rocket-pool/markets",bullish
222,"hey buddies,

in this proposal I just want to give to cake staker another bonus for having they cake locked.


every 100 cake locked for a year gives you a full lottery ticket at the end of the countdown.

there would be a limitation of 100 tickets per wallet per year.

users with little wallet can participate, let's say someone has only 50 cake staked, he need to stake them during two years in order to get 1 full and free lottery ticket.

This upgrade would gives more incentive for users to lock their cake again. at the end of the day there would be just more winners to the lottery but the system won't change more than that.

Maybe it could make more people aware of the lottery and it's potential to win big, so more players could play because they already have a taste of it.",bullish
223,"#### ABSTRACT

In this AIP, we will detail how Good Month Labs will drive ApeCoin DAO voting adoption. Over the past 6 months, Good Month Labs has established a web3 podcast called Never Fade. The Never Fade podcast has proven distribution across multiple web3 communities and can be used as a distribution point to drive hype around the Active AIPs to show the DAO’s consistency & effectiveness. Using its Cake platform, Good Month Labs will create a custom dApp to incentivize adoption of governance by allowing the engaged audience of Never Fade to earn $APE. A scalable dApp will allow for deeper integration of networks in the future.  Solution: [Voter Adoption dApp UI/UX Demo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAL9Y4LthkA)

225,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes APX Finance ($ALP) to Syrup Pool on opBNB!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re excited to announce a new Syrup Pool with APX Finance, the partner for PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2!

APX Finance is a decentralized derivatives exchange that designed the Permissionless DEX Engine, which powers PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on BNB Chain and Arbitrum.

For an update on how the product has performed thus far, please refer to the section **“Performance of Perpetuals v2 on Arbitrum”** below.

#### The Syrup Pool on opBNB:

Stake ALP tokens to earn CAKE tokens!


Syrup Pool on opBNB:
  - **Total Tokens:** ~11,250 CAKE + 427,500 APX (converted into CAKE)
 - **Distribution duration:** 45 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1000 UTC on 20 Dec 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1000 UTC on 4 Feb 2024
 - **Token rewards per second:**  CAKE (will depend on final CAKE amount)


The CAKE tokens used to fund these Syrup Pools will be provided by PancakeSwap and APX Finance equally. The final CAKE amount will depend on token prices at time of conversion.

On PancakeSwap’s side, the CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from the Syrup Pool will encourage more users to participate in PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on opBNB, increasing liquidity, which will ultimately lead to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

| Image taken from our [**tokenomics page**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics) |

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

There will be no cap on how much CAKE a user can stake in the Syrup Pool. This is to encourage as much on-chain ALP liquidity as possible.

#### Performance of Perpetuals v2 on Arbitrum

Since the launch on 28 Aug 2023, PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on Arbitrum has achieved impressive results, surpassing $1 billion in cumulative trading volume and attracting over 1000 users., With the support of liquidity attracted through syrup pools, our platform has consistently secured a prominent position among the leading derivatives protocols on Arbitrum in volume.


| ![](https://i.imgur.com/v4088M1.png) | 
|:--:| 
| Image taken from our [**Dune dashboard**](https://dune.com/apollox/alp-v2-arb) |

Our previous Syrup Pool proposal successfully incentivized liquidity provision, which is crucial for facilitating trading on the perpetuals platform. We have currently attained more than $2 million in liquidity value of minted ALP tokens, of which ~$1.5 million are staked in our Syrup Pool.

[During the period of incentivisation, how much CAKE was spent on the ALP pool? How much CAKE was burnt instead? This will allow your community to understand the value-for-money]

Our goal is to establish a dominant position in the derivatives category on opBNB. This proposal seeks to kickstart liquidity provision in the ALP Pool to facilitate trading for the perpetuals platform on opBNB.

#### What is Perpetuals Trading?

**Disclaimer: This information presented in this proposal does not constitute any form of financial advice or recommendation, please do your own research before making any investment decisions.**

Perpetuals, perpetual swaps, or perps are a special type of futures contract without an expiration date.

Futures trading allows users to enter positions on margin (leverage) using borrowed funds to optimize capital. Using leverage allows a user to enter a position with a size that is larger than their account balance. For example, using 10x leverage, a user could trade 100 CAKE for the price of 10 CAKE. In this example, the initial margin would be 10 CAKE which is used to collateralize the leveraged position.

In PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2, we've streamlined our interface by removing the order book and market depth displays. Instead, our partner APX Finance has introduced the ALP pool, which now provides liquidity for all trading pairs, maximizing your capital usage. The ALP pool will actively participate in the market-making process for our V2 perpetual contracts. 

More information can be found in the documentation pages of [**APX Finance**](https://apollox-finance.gitbook.io/apollox-finance/welcome/trading-on-v2) and [**PancakeSwap**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/perpetual-trading/perpetual-trading-v2).


#### What is $ALP?

From the team: “ALP is APX Finance’s liquidity provider token made up of a pool of assets (USDC, USDT, DAI, ETH, BTC). Users can become liquidity providers by using any of the specified assets to buy ALP. ***ALP pool is the direct counterparty of V2 on-chain perp traders.***

The initial issue price of ALP is USD$1. The price of ALP is influenced by the profit or loss of the pool and income from trading fees, funding fees and liquidations.

In the future, APX Finance plans to support more utility of ALP on the platform such as earning transaction fee rewards, using ALP as margin for perpetuals trading, and participation in DAO governance and voting.

A step-by-step guide on buying, selling, and staking ALP can be found [**here**](https://apollox-finance.gitbook.io/apollox-finance/welcome/apollox-liquidity-pool/how-to-buy-alp)”

**Summary:**
The [ether.fi](https://www.ether.fi/) team proposes a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a weETH-WETH pool on Ethereum mainnet, with a 10% emissions cap.

    • Discord - https://discord.com/invite/zqGzcuQWvD
    • Twitter - https://twitter.com/ether_fi

**Protocol Description:**

Ether.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.

ETH staked through the ether.fi protocol liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Currently when users wish to restake their LST’s they lock their tokens, which breaks composability in DeFi. Staking with eETH on [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols. No other liquid staking protocol has this capability.

The eETH contract has been live since June 2023 and has approx. 10,000 ETH held within in - this ETH was accumulated before eETH was officially launched and available for end users to hold directly. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.

Through these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum's staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.

**Motivation:**

Ether.fi is looking to seed a weETH/wETH pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for eETH. Incentivising a Balancer pool could significantly boost the liquidity of the LRT. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the DeFi ecosystem. To ensure success, ether.fi is committed to enhancing the value of the veBAL ecosystem by promoting pool liquidity through Hidden Hand voting incentives

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:**  - Currently, the protocol utilises a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed ether.fi executives. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token in approx. 3-6 months.

2. **Oracles:** - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the ether.fi team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee.

3. **Audits:** - Audit reports for the ether.fi protocol are found on the GitBook page - https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits. The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance. 

4. **Centralization vectors:** - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team at Ether.fi, however this will be upgraded with the implementation of the ether.fi DAO and governance.

5. **Market History:** eETH is a brand new Liquid restaking token, therefore there is not much in the way of market history as Balancer will serve as the first pool to support wrapped eETH.

6. **Value:** - The weETH/wETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token. The pairing of eETH with wETH allows for a more seamless trading experience within the Ethereum ecosystem, which could attract more users and, in turn, generate more fees for the platform.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a Syrup Pool with Tron! Tron is a Layer 1 decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the TRON DAO and was launched in 2017.

#### What is Boost?

Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn TRX tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 18,888,888 TRX
 - **Distribution duration:** 120 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 23 Nov 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 23 Mar 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 5.465 TRX

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the TRX Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a TRX-BUSD farm. 

The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that. During the farm, or at the end of the 120-day period – approx. 1200 UTC on 23 Mar 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0.2x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.5x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. In case of fundamental token issues or severe risks to our users, PancakeSwap reserves the rights to downgrade to 0 multiplier until the investigation is completed.

#### What is $TRX?

From the team: “The main use cases of TRX are as follows:

* **Governance:** Obtain voting rights on TRON by locking TRX on the TRON platform
* **Purchasing new tokens:** TRX can be used to purchase tokens issued on TRON
* **Be eligible for BTT airdrop:** Addresses holding TRX will be eligible to receive BTT airdrop rewards”

title: [ARFC] Ethereum v2 Reserve Factor Adjustment
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic @ChaosLabs
created: 2024-02-27

---

# Summary

This publication proposes periodically increasing the Aave v2 Ethereum Reserve Factor (RF) to encourage users to migrate to Aave v3.

# Motivation

With Aave v3 now crossing the $8 Billion TVL threshold and $3 Billion remaining in Aave v2, this publication seeks to encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3 by increasing the RF.

With all other variables held constant, increasing the RF over time in isolation will result in a reducing deposit rate. Users are encourage to migrate to v3 in search of higher yield.

With market conditions permitting, we propose initiating a periodic 5.00% RF increase across all assets every 14 days as mentioned [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766) up to a threshold of 99.99%. During each increase cycle, we will monitor how users respond and, if any potential risks are identified, the next RF increase will be delayed until it is safe to implement.

Do note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect users' health factor, and this method has already been [implemented on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350) for some time. 

# Specification

The below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.

| REN  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| renFIL| 35.00%| 99.99% |
| SNX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| sUSD | 30.00% | 35.00% |
| SUSHI| 99.00% | 99.99% |
| TUSD | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| UNI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| USDC | 25.00% | 30.00% |
| USDP | 20.00% | 25.00% |
| USDT | 25.00% | 30.00% |
| UST  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| wBTC | 30.00% | 35.00% |

| YFI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| ZRX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |

Upon implementing this proposal, a subsequent AIP will be submitted every 2 weeks that increases the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99%, subject to market conditions. 

# Disclosure

TokenLogic, karpatkey and Chaos Labs receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.

# Next Steps

1) Gather feedback from the community.
2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage

It all started about 3 years ago. I started my introduction to the world of cryptocurrencies. I had a great job, enough money to save. I was lucky, I made a lot of money, on the best days my profit was around $10,000. That's when I decided to lock up some of it for a long period of time.

But all good things come to an end. Now I'm in the hospital, I have a lot of unpaid bills and a hacked wallet with my tokens.

At first I thought I would just sell my steaking to an acquaintance for 50% of the value to cover my loans. But we discovered that my wallet had been hacked. Since I am a developer and have a lot of experience in WEB3 I realize that I can bypass the sweeper.

Now there is a very important question. Is there any possibility to ask you for help?

There are several solutions:

We will reach the management of pancake, they will allow me to withdraw earlier, even if at 100% loss of rewards

Users who can help - donate funds to me, and I extend steaking for a year and give the private wallet key to you

242,"# StableSwap Fee Adjustment Overview

We propose lowering StableSwap fees from 0.15% to 0.01%. Currently, StableSwap has provided stability and support to our stablecoin transactions. However, in order to provide a better trading experience for PancakeSwap users and increase competitiveness, we are proposing to reduce fees on StableSwap.

## Why are we reducing fees?
After careful analysis, we are proposing to reduce the fees for StableSwap for the following reasons: 

* Provide a more efficient trading experience for users
* Increase user adoption and attract more volume to StableSwap
* Stay competitive with similar product offerings on BNB Chain
* Improve volumes on other swap pairs by reducing the total fees incurred on trade routing
* Increase the volume of trades and overall liquidity on PancakeSwap

The following tables will show the fee changes  for our StableSwap pools:

**Current StableSwap Fees**
| StableSwap Pair | Trading Fees | LP Rewards | CAKE Buyback | PancakeSwap Treasury |
|:---------------:|:------------:|:----------:|:------------:|:--------------------:|
|    USDT-BUSD    |     0.15%    |   0.075%   |    0.06%    |        0.015%        |
|    USDC-BUSD    |     0.15%    |   0.075%   |    0.06%    |        0.015%        |
|    USDT-USDC    |     0.15%    |   0.075%   |    0.06%    |        0.015%        |

**Proposed StableSwap Fees**
| StableSwap Pair | Trading Fees | LP Rewards | CAKE Buyback | PancakeSwap Treasury |
|:---------------:|:------------:|:----------:|:------------:|:--------------------:|
|    USDT-BUSD    |     0.01%    |   0.005%   |    0.004%    |        0.001%        |
|    USDC-BUSD    |     0.01%    |   0.005%   |    0.004%    |        0.001%        |

RWA toolkit for Gold and Silver on Balancer.

**Summary:**

Aurus provides the tech infrastructure for Web3 businesses to secure their protocols, treasuries, products and token economics with stable, real-world value, in the form of tokenized Gold and Silver. 

Our vision is to become “The Value Layer of Web3” - innovating with RWA’s in Defi, Gaming and Digital Collectibles.

Aurus takes a decentralized approach, as we only partner with trusted precious metal providers. The Aurus Foundation performs KYC / KYB / AML - to ensure that only verified actors can provide the highest quality metals to the Aurus ecosystem. These metals are verified, audited and stored with top tier 3rd party custodians, in locations like: London, Zurich, Madrid.

The below pools are intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the Aurus ecosystem and subsequent RWA Alliance partners, driving the majority of traded volume to Balancer.

(switch to Polygon network)

**Protocol Description:**

Xave Finance (pronounced “Save Finance”) is scaling stablecoin markets (any kind of stablecoin backed by currencies, commodities, on-chain synthetic, anything tokenized or tracking market pricing from off chain etc) by building its’ “FXPool” used by stablecoin issuer partners Aurus (http://aurus.io/), StraitsX (https://straitsx.com/), Stasis (https://stasis.net/), Circle (https://circle.com/), VNX (https://vnx.io/), and others covering EUR, CHF, Gold, Silver, USD, SGD, IDR, BRL and more.

**Motivation:**

The Aurus Foundation is registered in the UK and received legal passing via direct & ongoing consultation with the FCA on all Aurus tokens. The Foundation facilitates the tokenization of tGOLD ($TXAU) and tSILVER ($TXAG) commodity tokens, on behalf of precious metal providers, like Gold Refineries. One such partner is Sempsa JP refinery in Spain, which has been operating for more than 100 years and is part of the broader Heimerle Meule Group of companies. 
Aurus, Sempsa JP refinery & Xave Finance are together pioneering an alliance of liquidity partners in web3, particularly focused on Real World Assets. The RWA Liquidity Alliance will enable many top projects and companies to acquire tGOLD and tSILVER to diversify their treasuries. In order to join the Alliance, members need to first add a minimum of 50% of their tGOLD &/or tSILVER paired with USDC as LP on Xave / Balancer. Alliance members then qualify to redeem or sell their metals directly with Sempsa refinery too, via a White Glove service. This provides another source of “off-chain” liquidity for them, which should encourage “stickier liquidity” on-chain for the long term.

Together we will be helping to build further use cases for this pool to enable liquid Gold and Silver FX trades globally. Aurus is developing a use case for Gold-backed digital collectibles, where the FXPools will benefit, as the tGOLD tokens used to “back/collateralise” the collectibles will be sourced from the pools.
There is a high probability that the RWA narrative continues to gather strength too, which will provide further opportunities and should lead to increased demand. Xave and Aurus are also currently developing partnerships with key distribution partners in India and Turkey, two countries with extremely high demand for Gold. This would connect their users / traders directly to the tGOLD & tSILVER FXPools, driving further volume.

These real world use cases will bring sustainable fee generation via real economic activity to the DAO. Xave and Aurus would like to work with the community to incentivize the TXAU:USDC & TXAG:USDC Polygon FXPools, as well as the TXAU:TXAG:WETH Polygon pool with BAL rewards. Working together to build more real world use cases and further growth and distribution of Gold & Silver in DeFi.
Furthermore, Aurus is in talks with all RWA partners to create new pairs with their own project tokens and pair them with TXAU, as well as provide allocations of their own tokens for future LP incentives on Xave / Balancer. With the help of BAL rewards, we aim to scale to $1M TVL in each pool through onboarding new alliance members and through community members of all projects and Aurus partners. With a total target of $3M TVL over the next 6-12 months. 


**Specifications:**
 
1. Governance:
Governance will be done via snapshot for now. Later on Xave’s own VE governance structure will be deployed (forked from veBAL). Current admin of the TXAU:USDC & TXAG:USDC Polygon FXPools is the team’s ops 2/3 multisig 0xC76Ec28801ad09020fB89da48306176e56960CC5 (Polygon), until the community is ready to take on ownership of the Xave protocol.
The TXAU:TXAG:WETH Polygon pool is deployed directly on Balancer v2.

2. Oracles:
The TXAU:USDC & TXAG:USDC FXPools utilise a Chainlink oracle to allow FX accurate swaps for a predetermined range of the bonding curve. Beyond this range (called the “beta region”), LP ratio then dictates the price of trades. At this point, arbitrageurs are incentivized by significantly cheaper fees to trade the pool back to the “beta region” where FX price is followed. LPs are also incentivized to keep liquidity in the pool especially while it is outside the “beta region”, due to existing parameters that yield much higher fees charged to traders swapping the pool away from the “beta region”.
The TXAU:TXAG:WETH Polygon pool does not use oracles as it is deployed directly on Balancer v2.

3. Audits:
[v2 Final Audit - Xave Finance](https://docs.xave.finance/contract-audits/v2-final-audit)

4. Centralization vectors:
2/3 operations multisig that owns contracts until contracts are “battle tested” and community is ready to takeover

5. Tokens:
The Aurus Foundation, registered in the UK and received legal passing via direct & ongoing consultation with the FCA, facilitates the tokenization of tGOLD ($TXAU) and tSILVER ($TXAG) commodity tokens, on behalf of precious metal providers, like Gold Refineries. Each token is backed 1:1 with fully allocated LBMA Gold or Silver. Where each metal token equals 1 gram of the underlying physical metal.

6. Value:
The pools consist of the tGOLD ($TXAU) and tSILVER ($TXAG) commodity tokens, where tokenization is facilitated by the Aurus Foundation, on behalf of regulated precious metals providers like Sempsa JP refinery. Who will concentrate liquidity for real world use cases dependent on capital efficient on-chain FX, to support the multiple use cases for Gold and Silver across web3, as discussed above.
These pools are intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the Aurus ecosystem and subsequent Alliance partners, routing all trades via these pools, and hence the majority of traded volume.

246,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/increase-the-protocol-fee/2533).

# Motivation

With the coming transition to veBAL, it’s time to re-evaluate the economics around how the protocol captures fees. When the protocol fee was initially activated and set to 10% there was no plan for veBAL and no plan for how the collected fees would be used. After the activation of veBAL, 75% of protocol fees will go to lockers and 25% to the DAO. 

According to our most recent [revenue projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSFTtEYg1kqRVvvPfFpqLT93PtZWBjEQfPf8-lH93_0/edit#gid=0) (credit Zekraken), lockers only stand to gain around $2.1M per year ($2.8M * 0.75).  With ~$95M in BAL/WETH that’s an APR of ~8%. Note that this assumes all LP’s lock and does not include revenue from other sources like the agreement with Copper (hard to accurately predict). There is upside to this 8% APR if fewer users lock and Copper revenue remains strong. 

The vast majority of TVL, volume, and fee earnings come from pools that receive BAL incentives. There is little evidence to suggest that swap fees are driving any significant amount of usage at the moment. By introducing veBAL, we are making the competition around BAL incentives the primary driver of the protocol’s growth going forward. **We can accelerate the adoption of this flywheel effect by increasing the protocol fee from 10% to 50%.** This would move the 8% APR immediately to 30-40% APR. 

It also has the added bonus of increasing the DAO’s potential earnings from ~$700k per year ($2.8M * 0.25) to potentially as high as ~$3.5M if there is no response from LP’s to the protocol fee increase. This allows the DAO to build up a stronger balance sheet and better prepare for extended market downturns. 

I believe we can choose to focus on BAL emissions as the primary growth driver OR swap fee earnings. Right now, most LP’s use Balancer because of BAL emissions and not because of swap fees. This means LP’s will want to lock veBAL so they can ensure continued emissions to their pool(s) of choice. Locking funds for a year carries significant opportunity cost, so that will be balanced by the revenue lockers receive from protocol fees. The higher that revenue, the more likely lockers will choose to participate in the “BAL wars”. 

For those users of Balancer who are primarily interested in earning swap fees, there is little reason to lock veBAL. By keeping the protocol fee at 10%, we are placing a high value on these users in terms of the protocol’s future success. I would argue our path to success is in creating the strongest incentive possible for participation in veBAL. Increasing the protocol fee to 50% in combination with the release of veBAL creates a very compelling narrative for users to understand the value proposition in locking. 

# Risks

* **LP’s who primarily value swap fee earnings will leave Balancer**

* Mitigation: none. I believe this group represents a tiny number of total Balancer users, so this is an acceptable risk.
* **This will hurt partners like Element who don’t rely on BAL rewards.**
* Mitigation: We are in talks with partners to understand how an increase to 50% would affect them. There is also the potential for a revenue sharing arrangement in the future, where the 50% protocol fee would be split between the partner and Balancer DAO. 
* **As emissions decrease due to the new veBAL emission schedule, the protocol won’t be able to evolve to a model that is sustained with swap fees only**
* Mitigation: If the goal is to move away from emissions entirely, it will be necessary to reduce the protocol fee as emissions come to an end. Alternatively, a new split of the protocol fee could be proposed that allocates some to buying BAL to distribute through the gauge system. This keeps liquidity mining going without requiring new emissions.

Through a continued analysis of our approved gauges I have identified five gauges that I believe should be migrated to a 2% cap. The historical and current activity (bribing/voting) has never approached the 2% limit and it is unlikely any of these would scale if they happen to be directed a large amount of BAL emissions. The relevant teams have been made aware of our plans and are in agreement on this course of action. 

Gauges to be migrated: COW/WETH, COW/GNO, VITA/WETH (50/50), TEL/BAL/USDC, TEL/BAL

### Specification
#1
If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction to the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling `grantRole` with the following arguments:

This corresponds with the role for calling `add_gauge` on the `gaugeController` as seen [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json#L347).

account: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`

This removes the ability for the DAO Multisig to directly add gauges to the controller.

The new capped gauges will be live for voting by September 15th. The old gauges will be killed on September 21st. This allows enough time for votes and bribes to be moved over to the new capped gauges.

On September 21st, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the `AuthorizerAdaptor` at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call `performAction` using `0xab8f0945` for the `data(bytes)` argument and the following list of contracts for the `target(address)` argument.

title: [ARFC] Aave Robot v1
author: @bgdlabs - BGD Labs (Bored Ghosts Developing)
created: 2023-06-28
---

## Summary

Request approval from the community to move forward Aave Robot v1, the first iteration of a framework and architecture of smart contracts to automate permissionless actions of Aave, like those related to the Aave governance v2; powered by Chainlink Automation.

## How will it work?

A detailed description of the system can be found on the [Aave governance forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-robot-v1/13091), but as summary:
- Multiple `Robot` smart contracts will be deployed, that will contain the logic to 1) understand when a permissionless action on Governance v2 (or cross-chain governance) can be triggered (queueing, execution, cancel) and 2) execute them.
- A `AaveCLRobotOperator` will be deployed on each network, that will allow for the DAO to have ""admin"" control on all the underlying robots, in order to register new ones, cancel or funding them with the LINK required for execution.
- To simplify operational complexity, the maximum gas limit proposed will be close to the maximum allowed by the underlying Chainlink infrastructure. As anybody can top-up LINK on the Aave Robot via a permissionless function on the `AaveCLRobotOperator`, the community could request for external entities to partially or totally cover the execution costs of proposals by using it.
- As in some cases it could be desirable for example to disable automation of a specific proposal and this is not possible with ""slow"" governance procedures, a Robot Guardian role is defined that will be able to 1) disable automation for a certain governance proposal and 2) ""pause"" automation on a specific network.
Both actions are non-invasive, as it only affects the automation system, not the underlying governance system at all.
Initially, BGD will keep the Robot Guardian role.

### Setup flow

For the DAO to activate the system the procedure is simply the following:
1. A technical service provider (BGD in this case) will deploy both the Robot smart contracts and the `AaveCLRobotOperator`, on each supported network.
2. A governance proposal will be submitted to activate and configured those robots, and top them up with LINK from the Aave Collector.

Afterwards, the DAO can register new robots via governance proposal, or manage the registered ones however needed.",bullish

257,"### Service Provider Name & Overview

 The Balancer Maxis are a passionate group of Balancer community contributors. A center of excellence that keeps the Balancer ecosystem operating at a first class level. As the protocol grows, this team's responsibilities will likely grow with it. We have picked up maintenance tasks from other organizations in the Balancer ecosystem as it continues to decentralize and would expect this to continue (see examples below).

### Leader(s)

Solarcurve - joined by Zekraken, Mike B, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, and Danko8383.

**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct (or link to your own)**: Yes

**Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines:** Yes

### Domains of Operation

*Multisig Management*

* Linear (boosted) pool settings
* Swap fee and amplification adjustments
* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL
* Adding new reward tokens to gauges
* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees
* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig

**Expertise:** Besides setting swap fees, this group has done all these tasks from day 1. Soon after we took control of swap fees from our friends at Gauntlet, the protocol broke the previous record of 24h fees earned. We believe our track record justifies our continued management of these multisigs until such time as governance approves another SP to take them over.

*Governance*

* We serve on the [Governance Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp/2324) and ensure continuity of Balancer’s Governance Process
* Active participants in discord and the forum on governance topics
* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)
* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process
* Manage admin of the Governance forum
* We will pursue various strategic initiatives, either individually or as a group, at our discretion such as deploying to Optimism or the new Operating Framework
* In the cases that voting power in other protocols from tokens held in Balancer’s Treasury has been delegated to us, we will represent Balancer’s interest in these votes.

**Expertise:** We helped to design Balancer’s governance system and are very active users of it. It is safe to say our group has the strongest working knowledge of Balancer’s governance system outside of Balancer Labs. For now it does require active management to ensure votes are carried out in an orderly fashion then properly executed. We believe our track record here again speaks for itself and we will continue to operate in the same fashion we have been until governance approves a new governance framework or approves another SP to take these tasks over.

*User/project support*

* We manage Balancer’s discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed
* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions
* We often deploy new pools for other projects
* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists
* We help with UI testing for Balancer

**Expertise:** If you come to discord we’ll likely be the ones helping you out. We are also spread out in many chats with projects offering advice and performing routine necessary tasks as described above. It is safe to say almost all projects that have used Balancer over the last year have spoken to one of us at some point. We will continue to operate in this support capacity and offer any assistance we can to the community and the efforts of other SP’s.

*Community*

* We manage a Coordinape circle open to all DAO contributors
* Onboarding framework for new contributors
* Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO, or between SPs
* Regular health-check on SP and community contributors with recurrent feedback

**Expertise:** These initiatives were pioneered by some of our members over the last six months. We will continue iterating and exploring these both with our in house knowledge but also in collaboration with the broader community.

*Record Keeping*

* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.
* Maintaining, updating, and improving official Balancer documentation as a bridge between the greater community and core development team.

### Key Objectives & Success Metrics

*Multisig Management*

* Transactions are vetted for accuracy and executed in a timely manner
* Public discord channels are used for swap fee discussion so the community can provide input and feedback.

*Governance*

* Balancer’s Governance system continues to operate in a fair and transparent manner.
* We will continue being very active participants and leaders

*User/project support*

* Discord/telegram chat questions will be answered in a timely manner

*Community*

* Coordinape will pay out promptly each month
* We will act as a touch point for any interested contributors to Balancer DAO

*Global*

* We commit to undertake all activities in public where reasonable. We aim to responsibly grow the Balancer Maxis and this can only be done when the community is able to interact and engage with us. There must be more opportunities for this in the future.
* We will continue to facilitate the weekly Treasury meeting (Tuesday 11am EST in discord) open to the public. This is a good opportunity for anyone in the community to talk to us about the Treasury or any other relevant topic.
* We will facilitate a monthly community call where all SP’s are welcome to join for their monthly updates. This eases the burden on the community to attend many calls. Again, optional participation by other SP’s.

### Length of Engagement & Budget:

3 months.

Budget of 6,875 BAL per month for salaries (1,250 per person, Danko at 625) which will be max locked in veBAL by contributors. Additional monthly allocations of 100 BAL for gas costs and 4,000 BAL for Coordinape.

**Total for 3 month engagement:** 32,925 BAL

**Impact on the Treasury**: The Treasury currently holds ~4M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis would cost less than 1% of the treasury’s BAL holdings.

**ETH Address to Receive Funds**: 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325

**Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation):** N/A

*As a final note, if this proposal passes Zen Dragon will be replacing mkflow on the Governance Council as he voluntarily steps away and into other roles in the ecosystem. We thank him for his service. The members of the council will now be Solarcurve, Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, and Zen Dragon.*",bullish

**Background**

The bug [disclosure](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1694014645378724280)  made by Balancer related to linear/boosted pools being compromised resulted in their gauges being “killed” (i.e. no longer eligible to receive BAL rewards),  [BIP-420](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-420-refund-voting-incentives-for-pools-shut-down-due-to-bug-report/5159) has already made whole projects who incentivized veBAL voters via hidden hand, but the purpose of this proposal is to cover the project(s) from Warden's vote market. 

Of all the affected pool's Warden has already assisted in recovering Overnight Finance's funds, and the only project that needs to be made whole is Idle Finance. 

Please note, for reference, the only other vote market, Stake Dao's, has been confirmed to not have any other such cases. Meaning this will be the last vote incentive refund proposal related to the exploit mentioned above.

263,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-empower-ballers-to-allocate-bal-to-polygon/1964).

Polygon (MATIC) has seen strong user adoption this year with major DeFi projects like Aave, Sushi, and Curve all deploying there. The time has come for Balancer to join the party. The polygon team has agreed to pledge $5M worth of MATIC as rewards over the course of 8 weeks to be allocated at our discretion. Balancer Labs has taken care of deployment logistics and with the approval of BAL voters we can jump start liquidity with BAL + MATIC incentives. This proposal would allow the Ballers to allocate BAL + MATIC incentives to chosen Balancer pools on polygon. To match polygon’s $5M worth of MATIC, I propose we begin with a 25,000 BAL per week allocation which can be adjusted in the future at the discretion of the Ballers but not reduced below 25,000 until the initial 8 week matching period has completed. These 25,000 BAL would come from the fixed 145,000 weekly issuance, reducing the total L1 incentive to 120,000 rather than increasing BAL inflation.

**Motivation**

Other polygon deployments have been wildly successful. Recently Sushi has done more volume on polygon than ETH mainnet (check [this thread](https://twitter.com/RaphaelSignal/status/1406234551618244611) and [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mhonkasalo/status/1406181121562398723)). Balancer brings a unique primitive to polygon by being the only flexible AMM. Forthcoming features like the stable swap factory will give us additional competitive advantages on polygon compared to ETH mainnet where similar products exist in the market. Based on my analysis of Sushi’s metrics, I believe we can also expect to exceed fees earned on ETH mainnet after a few weeks go by on polygon.

The Ballers plan to focus on multi-asset pools with higher fees and potentially building partnerships with polygon native projects. Any community input about pool composition or projects worth connecting with is greatly appreciated (#governance in discord).

25,000 is a sizable commitment but the potential opportunity is significant. I strongly believe we can generate more fees per BAL spent on polygon than we can with our current strategy on ETH mainnet.

**Specification**

If approved, the Ballers will immediately begin designing pools and assigning the BAL + MATIC rewards. As mentioned, the MATIC rewards would last for 8 weeks ($5M total over 8 weeks) and a minimum of 25,000 BAL per week would last for 8 weeks. After that, the Ballers can decide to adjust that number up or down (with community input!).

The goal is to vote this weekend and begin incentives on the 28th - pending any community discussion of course.",bearish

### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard dlcBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum and Arbitrum 
### Author: Aki Balogh & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
###  Date: 2024-06-24

---

### **Simple Summary:**

Proposal to onboard dlcBTC to Aave v3 on the Ethereum and Arbitrum pools.

### **Motivation/Background:**

dlcBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum, enabling Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi protocols while retaining full ownership of their assets. It leverages Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) for secure cross-chain transactions, ensuring trustless and decentralized asset management. dlcBTC is minted by a decentralized set of merchants who lock BTC with themselves (a process we call ""self-wrapping""), ensuring self-custody and reducing central points of failure.

Unlike other bridges, dlcBTC merchants ""self-wrap"" Bitcoin, meaning funds are never sent to an external address, reducing the risk of theft or loss. dlcBTC has a Chainlink proof of reserve feed. See [https://data.chain.link/feeds/arbitrum/mainnet/dlcbtc-por](https://data.chain.link/feeds/arbitrum/mainnet/dlcbtc-por).

**Benefits of listing that token:**

Listing dlcBTC will enable Bitcoin holders to use their assets as collateral within Aave, increasing liquidity and user engagement on the platform. It will attract a broader user base from the Bitcoin community and enhance the diversity of collateral options within Aave. Additionally, it supports DeFi platforms such as Nektar and Swaap, which can generate staking yield using dlcBTC.

**Market Impact:**

Including dlcBTC will positively impact Aave’s liquidity and user adoption, leveraging Bitcoin’s status as the largest digital asset by market cap and its global brand recognition. The secure and decentralized nature of dlcBTC will contribute to the platform’s growth and stability, enhancing security for users and expanding the overall market reach of Aave. While wBTC has seen great success, its reliance on a single custodian introduces significant counterparty risk. dlcBTC addresses this by decentralizing the merchant set, substantially reducing the potential for counterparty failures.

**Chain to be deployed/listed:**

Ethereum, Arbitrum

**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:**

* Use dlcBTC as collateral within Aave, enhancing liquidity options
* Commitments from the federated set of merchants to ensure “self-wrapped” Bitcoin deposits, visible at the https://mint.dlc.link/proof-of-reserve. Merchants in the process of onboarding include Amber Group, IMC, HashKey and Time Research
* Integration into DeFi platforms such as Nektar, Swaap and Archimedes to generate yield using dlcBTC
* As an exclusive offer to Aave users:
  * Earn 6X points when you use dlcBTC as borrow collateral on Aave
  * Earn 8X points when you deposit dlcBTC and mint GHO
  * Note: Health Factor of the position must be between 1.5 and 3 to qualify for this offer

* Farm Duration: 60 days
* Farm base multiplier: up to 25x
* Liquidity pair: RPT-CAKE (0.25% fee tier) v2 pair

268,"#### ABSTRACT

The DAO relies on two main systems that dictate and govern the entire DAO. Snapshot & Discourse. However, newcomers to the DAO may not be familiar with these systems, and the lack of instructional material available to them, such as video content, infographics, or live training, can lead to confusion, inactivity, and low participation (the ApeCoin DAO may be their first ever interaction with a DAO). This leaves new DAO members on their own to find their way around. This AIP aims to provide a central, easy to understand source of information for new members to use as a reference. Getting new members of the DAO up to speed and answering basic questions on day one will benefit the DAO across the board.

This proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z consumers via extremely popular and influential social media personalities on Instagram, Tik Tok, and Youtuber. The goal is to create awareness within the normies and introduce them to the Bored Ape Yacht Club as the best club in the world despite not having a club or any yachts, and that ApeCoin is the future of finance that will lead to financial freedom despite not having any utility or real world use cases.

By Achieving this goal we hope to increase demand for Apes and get hundreds or maybe even thousands of normies to come buy our bags. If we can convince them into truly believing that Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin are cool, we hope they will buy them to be a part of this great community with no interest of ever selling for a profit, resulting in an increased holder count. This can potentially get Apes out of the hands of Blur farmers and traders who only buy Apes to flip them for a 0.01 eth profit (or loss).
MAGA - Make Apes Great Again

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Increased holder count… This may or may not bring in a few thousand new ApeCoin bag holders.
New community members and DAO participants… We may or may not get a few thousand new plebs to complain about how down bad they are.

More hate and ridicule… We may get a bunch of people to make fun of and talk bad about Apes. But there’s no such thing as bad publicity right? Whether the things they say are good or bad they will be talking about us.

The idea is to convince the normies that Apes are cool and they need to be like us. To make them realize that the Bored Ape Yacht Club is the best club in the world and they need to join this club asap before they can no longer afford to join.

The only way to find out if it works is to FAFO. The more we FA, the more we FO. If we don’t FA, we’ll never FO.

The one benefit I can guarantee for sure is that 1000 community members will get to claim a free Twisted Ape Treasure Chest. I have 1000 of these Treasure Chests in stock and ready to ship. They are currently priced at 69 $APE, but if this AIP is approved, I will make them a free claim to the first 1000 wallets that vote on this AIP, regardless whether they vote yes or no.

We will also include delegated voters. If you delegate your votes to another wallet or are part of a sub community that votes separately such as Surreal or Mocaverse, our dev team will get all your wallet addresses from the snapshot and include you in the free claim.

I will post the winners of these Chests here on the forum as well as on X and Discord. I will ensure everyone finds out about it by making public announcements on as many Twitter spaces as I can get on. We will not request any personal information directly, however the claim will be made on our Shopify website with the standard checkout process similar to every other ecommerce store on Shopify. So mailing addresses will be as safe as they usually are as with any other order users place online.

If there are less than 1000 voters and delegates and we have some leftover Treasure Chests, then we will make them available for free to all ApeCoin holders via a random raffle system.

272,"## Proposal Discussion Topic

[Blockchain at Berkeley](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu) is creating this proposal in partnership with [Nomad](https://www.docs.nomad.xyz/) to Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam.

## Summary

In support of furthering the vision of [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.

Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.

Moonbeam is a reputable chain which has enjoyed high stability and considerable activity since its launch in January, making it a great fit for Uniswap’s trusted brand.

## About Moonbeam

Moonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by [Polkadot’s XCM](https://polkadot.network/blog/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format/), allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way.

Moonbeam was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the [100+ projects](https://moonbeam.network/community/projects/) building DApps and protocols on the network.

## Expanding Uniswap to Moonbeam

We believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. 

Uniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s. However, Uniswap has not yet expanded beyond the greater Ethereum ecosystem.

Unlike the other deployment targets, Moonbeam represents a much larger target market — Polkadot users. The growth potential of the Polkadot ecosystem is reflected in part by the fact that Polkadot consistently ranks in the top ecosystems for developer activity, despite having just enabled parachains auctions in December 2021. The Polkadot community has grown in parallel with the Ethereum community, and shares many of the same values — decentralization, censorship resistance, open access to finance, to name a few. However, the two communities have largely been discrete, and deploying Uniswap on Moonbeam brings them together in a meaningful way.

Moonbeam is the de facto DeFi hub for Polkadot. Blue chip DeFi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to Moonbeam, including Sushiswap, Lido, Curve, Chainlink and Covalent. As the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying Uniswap V3 will position it to become a premier AMM on Moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. This represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for LPs and UNI token holders.

The Nomad team has worked on this proposal because [Nomad and Connext](https://medium.com/connext/connext-has-partnered-with-nomad-e20cd8e62e31) have already been deployed as Moonbeam’s main bridging solutions, and have begun to drive cross-chain liquidity from Ethereum into Moonbeam. By deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, Nomad would be able to route even more liquidity into Uniswap pools and additionally facilitate cross-chain communication for Uniswap governance.

## Trust-Minimized Bridging and Cross-Chain Governance

Decentralized cross-chain governance is a topic we are excited about working on within the Uniswap ecosystem. As Uniswap Labs highlighted in their post about [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of Uniswap. The Moonbeam community already uses [Nomad](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) and [Connext](https://www.connext.network/) to bridge ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum; despite Moonbeam having only been live for two months, $35M TVL is currently bridged to Moonbeam via Nomad, with over $250M in total volume since deployment. However, Nomad is more than just a protocol for token bridging; at its core, Nomad is a protocol for trust-minimized arbitrary message passing, and Uniswap V3 deployed on Moonbeam can leverage Nomad for governance.

We have worked with developers at Uniswap Labs to research, understand, and document the current state of [cross-chain governance for Uniswap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQWXCXdA5to7RKfVPozI8vEcw_QJrRQMP9HiQ8nbOu0/edit#heading=h.708hyjg41wlu) deployments. It became clear that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. This problem will multiply as Uniswap is deployed to more chains.

Nomad can provide an out-of-the-box solution for this problem. Nomad’s own contracts are governed by a decentralized cross-chain [governance app](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/blob/main/packages/contracts-core/contracts/governance/GovernanceRouter.sol) built on its arbitrary message passing rails. This application can be [tailored](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/pull/95) for the purpose of governing Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum mainnet. Rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once, however, we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de-risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment, Moonbeam.


## Rewards and Grants

As part of this proposal, Nomad, via a grant from the Moonbeam Foundation, will commit $2,500,000 to the Uniswap Grants Program to help grow the Multichain Uniswap ecosystem.

Through collaborative discussions with members of the Uniswap community, we learned that there were likely higher-leverage ways to enrich the Uniswap community than just providing liquidity mining rewards. As Uniswap develops into a multi-chain ecosystem, we want to support developers working to create high-quality multichain apps building on-top of Uniswap, and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users. These grants will promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation towards this goal.

To borrow language from the [Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/blog/case-study-uniswap-grants/#:~:text=Uniswap%20Grants%20gained%20access%20to,Gitcoin%20was%20founded%20in%202017) announcement, we hope for this initiative to fund “bounties, hackathons, and grants” for “developers, designers, community organizers and other web3 builders” working on multi-chain projects which improve, extend, promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross-chain manner.


Examples of projects that could be funded with this grant include: 
- Building a cross-chain application which allows Uniswap LPs to close a position on Ethereum and open one atomically on Moonbeam
- Improving open-source wallet softwares to create better multi-chain user experiences for Uniswap users
- Building a frontend application which allows governance participants to more easily construct cross-chain governance proposals for Uniswap
- Leveraging Substrate’s native interoperability protocol, XCM, to build an application which composes Uniswap on Moonbeam with another substrate chain
Funding office hours to educate new users about multichain crypto experiences

We are so excited to see what members of the Uniswap community come up with to leverage this grant!

## Conclusion

We are excited about the possibility of the Uniswap community entering the Polkadot ecosystem via a V3 deployment on Moonbeam. To reiterate, we feel that this is a fantastic opportunity for the following reasons:

- **Expansion into Polkadot**: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam’s EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeam’s position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot. 
- **Trust-minimized Governance**: Per Uniswap’s goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomad’s trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future.
- **Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program**: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap. We will commit $2.5M to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the Uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand Uniswap’s multi-chain presence.

We are excited to engage with the Uniswap community and governance process to discuss more around bringing Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. Please let us know any and all feedback and criticism, so that we can improve this proposal and expand Uniswap into Moonbeam and Polkadot!",neutral

## Aave | Flipside Crypto Facilitator [v2]


![|588x331](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oajaMCfc_4eN6b8dmIvXjoDzDqSpDXtcnw_HboZrC7EJmSBn2ks8_BsmAdu5jQegCouSHnomUYFXldy2AELAIl8p1nmvrP724E3E13xvYNS9_OyffuuIaavulsTKxFXhozldtsYqYF7pr7O3KzzyPyI)

## Summary:

This proposal aims to progress a 6-month relationship between Aave and Flipside Crypto, creating sustainable frameworks, resources, and operational support.

This proposal incorporates key feedback from existing service providers and the community, shifting the scope to focus on existing capabilities and operational efficiency.

## Motivation:

Flipside has been a long-standing steward of Aave, contributing to multiple initiatives. We have been a previous grant recipient, 2nd ever delegate, and strategic growth partner.

This proposal seeks to cement Flipside’s role and further invest in services and resources toward a more sustainable, more engaged, and clearer future.

In particular, the proposal addresses increased diversity in the delegate base, up-to-date documentation, framework development, data availability, and community resources.

This proposal is aimed to be a low-cost way of introducing and investing in these services while encouraging delivery and a short renewal.

## Specification:

To initiate the service contract, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with flipsidecrypto2.eth (0x1ef753934C40a72a60EaB12A68B6f8854439AA78) as the recipient.

In terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()`method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a 180-day stream of 125,000 USDC. If successful, Flipside will offer and perform the following services on a 6-month basis:

278,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-v2-multisig-the-path-to-decentralization/1658).

### Context

Since its inception, the long term vision for the Balancer Protocol is to be fully governed by BAL token holders, while token ownership is aimed to be widely spread across the Balancer community.

But getting to that ideal, long-term vision of an actually decentralized and effective governance is no easy task. Protocol governance is a highly complex and rapidly evolving topic. The whole crypto ecosystem is still in the very early days of trying to figure out:

* which mechanisms and processes work best
* the necessary infrastructure, tooling and user interfaces that go with them
* the risks and concerns associated with each approach

Experimentation has been running wild in all directions:

* vote delegation,
* minimum quorum,
* specialized committees,
* continuous voting,
* augmented voting power via token lock,
* off-chain voting for signaling / polling,
* on-chain actions from off-chain voting by way of oracles,
* upgradeable smart contracts,
* time delays on sensitive actions,
* emergency actions via multisig (e.g. pause, shutdown),
* legal entities (e.g. foundation) providing support for the DAO,
* tools for DAO treasury management,
* token issuance to cover protocol expenses,
* incentivized voting,
* incentivized off-chain engagement (e.g. forum participation),
* and so on...

While also actively experimenting with governance-related initiatives, the Balancer community has leaned towards the more cautious and thoughtful approach of not trying to rush the path to full decentralization, so each step towards a mature on-chain governance will be taken with due care, having learned from others' experiences.

Balancer V1 contracts are immutable, so up to now there were no core protocol parameters to tweak/change. Instead, our governance has focused on a fair, inclusive BAL token distribution, which is carried out mainly through the protocol's liquidity mining. BAL holders have tweaked liquidity mining via off-chain voting. And to make that possible, BalancerLabs proudly developed in-house an open-source tool called [Snapshot](https://twitter.com/SnapshotLabs), which became the widely popular gold standard for off-chain voting in blockchain land. Snapshot was so successful that it's being spun off as its own initiative so that it can keep up with the improvements required by all its users.

Balancer V2 contracts, on the other hand, are not totally immutable and do allow for some tweaking of the core protocol operation, for instance, in turning on protocol fees. As a placeholder for a future onchain DAO, such limited admin powers will be initially granted to a multisig.

### The Multisig

First of all, a very important point: the multisig does NOT have decision making power, as its role is to simply enact on-chain the decisions BAL holders make via off-chain voting.

It will be deployed using [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), the most battle-tested multisig contract on Ethereum. Its n-of-m configuration will start as 6-of-11. Both parameters n and m may evolve and are ultimately defined by BAL holders with protocol security in mind.

Balancer's multisig signers are a diverse set of widely respected community members. These are the initial signers:

* [Alexander Lange](https://twitter.com/AlexLangeVC) (Inflection)
* [Ash Egan](https://twitter.com/AshAEgan) (Accomplice)
* [Davis Ramsey](https://twitter.com/DavisRamsey) (pools.vision)
* [Fabien Marino](https://twitter.com/bonustrack87) (Snapshot Labs)
* [Jake Brukhman](https://twitter.com/jbrukh) (CoinFund)
* [Kain Warwick](https://twitter.com/kaiynne) (Synthetix)
* [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki) (Gitcoin)
* [Mariano Conti](https://twitter.com/nanexcool) (Ethereum)
* [David Hoffman](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState) (Bankless)
* [Trent McConaghy](https://twitter.com/trentmc0) (Ocean Protocol)
* [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) (Fire-eyes)

Beyond those current signers, the community should strive to keep a short, ordered list of potential signers in order to make any eventual signer substitution as smooth and timely as possible.

During its lifecycle, the operation of the multisig is expected to gradually evolve towards requiring less and less trust, for instance by using [SafeSnap](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f) (which binds the results from Snapshot off-chain BAL voting to on-chain execution with the help of [Reality.eth](https://reality.eth.link/) oracles). Balancer has been an early supporter of SafeSnap.

In the long run, BAL holders are expected to retire the multisig in favor of a full-fledged Balancer DAO.

### Signer Duties

All signers are expected to create an Ethereum transaction ratifying each decision made by BAL holders through snapshot votes. This signature is expected to be done within the two weeks after the snapshot vote was concluded. Even after quorum is reached (by n signers), the remaining signers are also expected to sign before a multisig action is executed. This procedure aims to regularly confirm each signers' conformity to the off-chain votes and also to serve as recent proof of their ability to sign.

A signer shall lose his/her role (by action of the remaining multisig signers excluding him/her) in case he/she:

* acts against BAL token holders' off-chain voting;
* goes through 3 months or 2 votes (whichever takes longer) without performing any of their signer duties.

### Multisig Powers in V2

V2 smart contracts can grant some specific powers to an ""admin"" address, which will initially point to the multisig's address.

These powers are:

* set a share of swap fees to be diverted to the protocol (hard capped at 50% of the swap fee);
* set a flashloan fee;
* set a withdrawal fee to be charged by the protocol when an LP extracts tokens from the vault outside of a swap or when internal balances are withdrawn from the vault (the maximum withdrawal fee possible is 0.5% or 50 bps);
* extract from the vault collected protocol fees and/or excess balances (e.g. airdrops), to any destination;
* set the address of the oracle implementation;
* pause/resume swaps on all pools before a 4-month-after-launch deadline, after which Balancer V2 becomes unstoppable;
* set relayer addresses: relayers are (user opt-in, audited) contracts that can make calls to the vault (with the transaction ""sender"" being any arbitrary address) and use the sender's ERC20 vault allowance, internal balance or BPTs on their behalf;
* set dynamic-fee controllers: addresses (initially assigned to Gauntlet) that may change the swap fee for pools created by the dynamic-fee pool factory that will be deployed by Balancer Labs.

It's worth highlighting that the multisig will not have custody of (nor control over) funds from liquidity providers that lie inside Balancer Protocol contracts. Balancer V2 was designed so that even if the multisig goes rogue, all the liquidity is safe and can be withdrawn by their rightful owners.",bearish

286,"Wise token has integrated with Binance Smart Chain. Let's farm!

Eight months ago, Wise token successfully launched on Ethereum, and currently boasts a $300 million+ Total Value Locked (TVL) and about 10,000 users. Now on BSC, with a BEP20 version of Wise, ""WISB"" tokens have the same innovative features as the original token on Ethereum as well as some important upgrades:

**Reduced Impermanent Loss** - WISB/BNB liquidity pairs have significantly reduced impermanent loss because the prices of WISB and BNB are correlated (you can already see this concept in action on WISE/ETH LP on Uniswap and Quickswap). This makes WISB the premier LP token to have on BSC.

**BNB Airdrops** - Wallets staking WISB for 365 days or longer will receive weekly ongoing airdrops in BNB. The revenue for this is generated from lending out the massive liquidity formed in the presale. Currently, the weekly airdrop pool is $30,000 in BNB.

In addition to regular staking and LP farming on Pancakeswap (this proposal) and other partner DEXs, WISB tokens can be lent to the ""Reserve Pool"" which is a profits sharing pool where holders can earn a slice of the entire ecosystem's profits. This becomes especially interesting considering the profits generated by the system are bound to skyrocket once the Lending/Borrowing contract is deployed later this year.

WISB token is the ethical standard for all DeFi projects. It is a fairly launched, fairly distributed, fully decentralized, audited, crypto-backed and highly liquid asset.

**Fairly launched** - No parties received free tokens or discounted tokens, not even the founder/team.

**Fairly distributed** - Everyone paid fair market price to obtain WISB.

**Fully Decentralized** - 100% automated by smart contracts with no admin keys.

**Audited** - By CoinFabrik - [https://wisetoken.net/Wise_Audit_Report.pdf](https://wisetoken.net/Wise_Audit_Report.pdf) - (The WISE team also ran a 100 ETH bug bounty for the community to double check the code before launching.

**BNB-backed** - 100% value of the BNB raised in the presale goes straight into the Pancakeswap pair, which is then locked forever by burning the LP tokens.

**Highly liquid** - Massive liquidity allows investors to buy more without moving the price against themselves. All successful markets need massive liquidity in order to reach a large market cap and this is part of the long term WISB strategy.

WISB is one of the safest assets you can hold in the entire BSC ecosystem and also the only system that shares 100% of profits with its holders. Wise token was designed to be the most efficient DeFi ecosystem ever made, and we believe that focusing all profits back to users gives us a massive competitive advantage versus the traditional corporate-style business models. Wise token was created by the community and for the community, and we invite you to become part of our amazing group!

**Protocol Description:**

What is C.R.E.A.M. Finance?
CREAM Finance is a decentralized lending protocol for individuals and protocols to access financial services. The protocol is permissionless, transparent, and non-custodial.
Currently, CREAM is live on Polygon, Arbitrum and Binance Smart Chain .
CREAM Finance’s smart contract money markets are focused on longtail assets -- with the goal of increasing capital efficiency for all assets in crypto markets.
Users are able to lend any supported assets on our markets, and use the provided capital as collateral to borrow another supported asset.
CREAM offers a wide range of tokens on our money markets, including: stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD); interest-bearing stablecoins  defi tokens  LP-tokens  and other cryptocurrencies. This list is not exhaustive.

**Motivation:**

This proposal aims to add veBAL gauge for the CREAM/WETH 80/20 pool. BAL incentives would help deepen CREAM liquidity as 24-hour trading volume on exchange averages $2 million, it would bring sizable CREAM trading volume on Balancer.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:**
CREAM tokens serve as the governance token for the C.R.E.A.M. Finance network. CREAM token holders can vote on governance proposals through CREAM’s snapshot. CREAM forum is also used to discuss potential protocol changes and improvements.

2. **Oracles:** 
We have Chainlink as our main price oracle.

3. **Audits:** 
Audit Report: https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/CREAMSummary.pdf

4. **Centralization vectors:** 
      The token is not upgradeable or pausable.
      The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract.
      The team behind the token is known and can be held responsible for abuse.

5. **Market History:**
   Although CREAM protocol suffered a flash loan attack on its ETH platform, all other platforms are 
    currently functioning optimally.
    According to [defillama](https://defillama.com/protocol/cream-finance) Total Value Locked is $318.06

292,"#### Upgrade of Stader BNBx’s Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift Stader BNBx’s Farm rewards from the current BNBX-BNB v2 LP to the new BNBX-BNB v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the BNBX-BNB v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the BNBX token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current BNBX price.)

To ensure a smooth transition between v2 and v3 pairs, there will be an overlap of one day where there will be incentives directed towards both farms. This will occur on 4 May 2023. 

After **0800 UTC on 4 May 2023**, only the v3 pair will receive incentives, so users are encouraged to migrate in advance of this time.

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new v3 Farm will have the same emissions as the v2 farm. For example, if the v2 farm emits 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will also emit 10 CAKE per day.

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake BNBX-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 1.9x multiplier
- **89 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.05% fee tier):
- Stake BNBX-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 4.6x multiplier 
- **89 CAKE per day**

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 4.6x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### Key timelines

* **Launch of BNBX-BNB v3 farm:** Approx. 0800 UTC on 4 May 2023
* **Sunset of BNBX-BNB v2 farm:** Approx. 0800 UTC on 5 May 2023

#### How to migrate?

Please remember to shift your LP to the new farm before the v2 farm sunsets.

Please refer to the following [**link**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/code/v3-migration/how-to-migrate) for migration instructions

#### What is Stader BNBx?

Stader Labs offers a convenient way for users to stake their assets. It offers liquid staking solutions across multiple chains - BNB Chain, Polygon, Hedera, NEAR, Fantom, etc.

With Stader’s BNB liquid staking solution, users can stake BNB and earn yields with capital efficiency. Users can also amplify their yields by deploying BNBx (liquid token for staked BNB) in DeFi.

#### What is $BNBX?
From the team: “BNBx is a reward-bearing liquid token. The value of 1 BNBx token vs. BNB increases over time as staking rewards accumulate.”

Summary:
After being awarded 185,000 ARB from the Arbitrum Long Term Incentives Pilot Program (LTIPP), Origin has decided to proceed with enabling a gauge on a new Gyroscope pool.

This is a proposal to enable a 2% capped Balancer gauge for a wOETH/WETH pool on Balancer Arbitrum.
The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP). E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient, and could thus generate significant trading volume.
The pool shall be a Core pool with a swap fee of 4 basis points (0.04%) at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.
The pool has already been launched at 0xef0c116A2818A5b1A5D836A291856A321f43C2Fb 1.

Protocol Description:

Origin Ether was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC-20 LST aggregator that generates yield while sitting in your wallet by tapping into blue-chip protocols. OETH is backed 1:1 by ETH, WETH, stETH, and rETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is automatically distributed at least once a day through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.

OETH yield sources:

Deploying collateral across various DeFi strategies including Balancer pools
LST validator rewards
A 10bp exit fee charged upon redemption of OETH (completely avoidable if using a DEX)
Boosted yield from non-rebasing OETH
These four yield sources combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding any single LST or farming ETH manually. The current collateral allocation and yield strategies can be seen on-chain at all times on the OETH analytics. More information on OETH and its mechanics can be found in the OETH docs.

Wrapped OETH

wOETH is a tokenized ERC-4626 vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap OETH, you get back a fixed number of wOETH tokens. This number will not go up. You will have the same number of wOETH tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of OETH tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wOETH earns yield at the same rate as standard OETH. The wOETH to OETH exchange rate can be read from the wOETH contract’s previewRedeem function, the Chainlink exchange rate feed on Arbitrum, or the rate provider deployed by the Balancer team. More information on wOETH and the wrapping/unwrapping process can be found within the OETH docs.

Motivation:

We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency significantly. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to the following factors:

Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.
The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are illustrated by the deployed stMATIC/wMATIC E-CLP. The below box plot shows stMATIC/wMATIC liquidity utilization. The stacked area chart shows how the E-CLP already reached up to 55% of the total market share of stMATIC on Polygon soon after inception, with only a fraction of the total TVL.

E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools including the Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader applications whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/redemptions in the case of LSTs).
Specifications:

Governance: Origin Ether is governed by veOGV holders with any upgrades to the contracts being delayed by a 48-hour timelock. More details can be found at Governance and in the governance section of the OETH docs.

Oracles: OETH is using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH. Please see the oracle section of the OETH docs for more information.

rateProvider1 (for WETH): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Audits: OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD codebase, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. There have also been several OETH-specific audits. All audits can be seen in the audits section of the OETH docs. OpenZeppelin is now on retainer to review 100% of OETH smart contract changes.

Centralization vectors: With limited functionality, the Strategists are tasked with rebalancing collateral between strategies or pausing deposits. However, a 48-hour timelock enforces a wait period before any changes to the OETH contracts can be executed. The timelock is the owner of our ERC-20, Vault, and Strategies contracts.

Market History: OETH currently has millions in total liquidity across Curve, Uniswap, and Maverick.

![](https://i.imgur.com/wBjmw8E.jpg)

As mentioned in our initial [**veCAKE proposal**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), we are launching veCAKE in phases, and are excited to share the next deployment - Polygon zkEVM!

#### Recap: Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

Here’s a quick recap of veCAKE’s utility:

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders can directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE Managers, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE emissions. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
#### Inclusion of Polygon zkEVM in veCAKE Gauges System

Currently, the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and zkSync Era is **~28,416 CAKE/day**.  

With the inclusion of Polygon zkEVM, the current **Trading Allocation** emission of ~125 CAKE/day directed towards Polygon zkEVM Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions. 

As voted for previously, the Kitchen will retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs, such as ETH-USDC on Polygon zkEVM. This is to maintain the liquidity depth and volumes of these core pairs, which contribute significantly to CAKE buyback-and-burn.

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE will be launched shortly on Polygon zkEVM.",bearish
308,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across four (4) Aave V3 Optimism assets.

## Motivation

Chaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. 

*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*

Please find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).

You can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).

The output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC, WETH, USDC, and DAI on V3 Optimism, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with no effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)

**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$470,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**

### Liquidity and Position Analysis:

The TVL in Aave on Optimism (115.5M$) is concentrated primarily on two blue-chip, high-liquidity assets, which together account for ~75% of the supplied assets in $ values: USDC (44%) and Ethereum (30%), with the remaining supply, mostly being WBTC (13%). As we see adequate on-chain liquidity to support significant liquidations with minimal slippage on these assets, we recommend increasing the LT and LTV for them and one additional high-liquidity asset (DAI). Similarly, we recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty for WBTC, which is set conservatively at 10% to a lower level (7%) closer to that of USDC and Ethereum (5%).

**WETH**

We have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations. There are a few positions that supply 1-4M$ WETH each and borrow USDC against it; with the chain's current liquidity, it is possible to liquidate these positions with slippage far below the liquidation penalty. 

**WBTC and DAI**

We have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations, however, we should call out that around 50% of the on-chain supply of WBTC on Optimism is currently held on Aave, which calls for some caution. We have proposed an [amendment to the supply cap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-chaos-labs-supply-and-borrow-cap-updates-aave-v3-2023-02-24/12048/4) to limit the concentration of liquidity on Aave.

Given the blue-chip nature of BTC/WBTC, we expect significant arbitrage buying pressure to offset any slippage that may be created by future liquidations of WBTC and, therefore, recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty even with the current significant liquidity concentration on Aave. We expect a lower LP to drive liquidators to liquidate positions in smaller portions, pacing the process and allowing the market more time to react. 

**USDC**

We have identified a large position that supplies approximately 75% of USDC on Optimism and does not borrow against its ~$40M USDC position, and therefore does not currently pose a liquidation/bad debt risk to the protocol.  

### Recommendations

| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recs | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WETH | Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 85% | +2.5% |

Title: [ARFC] TokenLogic & karpatkey Service Provider Partnership
Discussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633
Author: @TokenLogic @karpatkey
Created: 2023-12-05

# Summary

This ARFC is to onboard TokenLogic & karpatkey to provide financial services to the Aave DAO for an initial period of 180 days, with a combined budget of 400k GHO.

# Motivation

## Overview

TokenLogic & karpatkey are responsible for delivering the following services to the Aave DAO: 

* Treasury Management;
* Strategic Assets' Liquidity; and
* Safety Module.

This funding will be used to support the TokenLogic and karpatkey teams to deliver the scope as outlined in the [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633).

## What to Expect

This proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO’s treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.

### Treasury Management

#### Develop the Architecture for Managing Aave's Assets

We aim to define a robust architecture for asset management. This architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s “shortExecutor”. Over time this will lead to fund management delegation and reduced governance overhead.

As the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.

#### Financial Security

A key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO’s known budget and anticipated expenses. 

This approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO. Key components of this objective will include:

* Bridging Aave funds between networks;
* Migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and
* Swap assets to align expenses and holdings.

Do note, that financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost-conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.

### Strategic Assets' Liquidity

TokenLogic and karpatkey will lead the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) and oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:

* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO’s price movement towards re-pegging while maintaining its utility across a full range of AMMs.
    * Utilize Maverick’s design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.
    * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.
    * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.
    * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility in their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave’s AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.
* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token’s value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:
    * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.
    * Enhance GHO’s extrinsic demand by incentivizing stable swap pools, such as Balancer’s GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.
     * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer’s architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO’s price stability.
     * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.
    * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.
* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it into tangible rewards through participation in voting markets such as Curve, Convex, Balancer, and Aura.

For operational simplicity and alignment with the DAO’s strategic objectives, evolving the GHO Liquidity Committee into the Aave Liquidity Committee is a logical step. 

### Safety Module

As part of the scope, karpatkey and TokenLogic will focus on modelling the SM performance during shortfall events and present proposals to diversify asset categories. This proposal will feature how the DAO can utilize the vlAURA position, realize synergies between GHO Liquidity and overall attempt to reduce the DAOs insurance fund spend.

The below outlines at a high level what we intend to deliver:

* Introduce additional asset categories to promote diversification and reduce the dependence on AAVE as a backstop for the protocol. 
    * Initial parameter configuration will incorporate feedback from @ChaosLabs & @Gauntlet. 
    * We will explore the feasibility of including GHO LP assets and harness rewards from other protocols.
    * Technical lift associated with creating new categories will be performed by @bgdlabs, with a security audit, if required.
* A 90-day emission forecast will be provided ahead of each emission cycle for community feedback. TokenLogic and karpatkey will prepare the payload to extend the SM emissions for @bgdlabs for review. 
    * Iterative emission cycles enable the DAO to target specific asset categories and improve the correlations between bad debt potential whilst maintaining a base level of insurance. The proposal will feature the ability to reward some categories with non AAVE rewards, like GHO, to support adoption and velocity.
* Capital efficiency, optimize emission schedules to balance attracting and retaining new deposits for each respective category. For example, the APR on stkAAVE is expected to continue being reduced given the recent GHO Mint Discount utility being added and the introduction of new categories.
* Analytics, a dashboard will be created/maintained that tracks the effective coverage of the insurance fund under various market conditions. The deposit value, composition of assets, APR over time and impact on the DAOs runway will all be readily available for the community to view. This is expected to create transparency and provide insight into the performance of the SM as an effective insurance fund for the DAO.

# Specification

The AIP will call the createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController interface to create two 180-day streams for 220k and 180k of GHO.

The following address will be the recipient of the 220k GHO stream:
Address: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`

The following address will be the recipient of the 180k GHO stream:
Address: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`

TokenLogic and karpatkey will periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.

TokenLogic and karpatkey are to be included in the Gas Rebate program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts, deployment and testing costs.

Upon the ARFC Snapshot passing, the GLC SAFE Signers will be updated. The following signer `0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f` is to be replaced with `0x818c277dbe886b934e60aa047250a73529e26a99`.

When the AIP onboarding TokenLogic and karpatkey as service providers pass, TokenLogic and karpatkey will jointly lead the GLC for the duration of the service provider contract with the Aave DAO.

311,"## Motivation:

Please see the motivation of the most recent[ gauge migration proposal.](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x4d4b23994bcc53e01144fe6ebd76806de80ea570911401ec6af63f357cc59804) The first risk noted, related to the undergoing audit, is causing a repeat of the migration. In this case, some minor issues related to pool owners setting swap fees and the `getRate()` function were discovered and since remediated in the newest ComposableStable factory deployment. Due to the time which has elapsed since the last proposal, there are several additional pools included in the scope of migration.

* [ComposableStablePoolFactory](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/pull/1708)

## Specification

The following pools will be replaced by the newly deployed ComposableStablePool and StablePool v2 contracts and will automatically be approved for a liquidity gauge; the underlying assets and attributes are identical to the originals. The deprecated pools will no longer be eligible for a liquidity mining gauge as it will be activated on the updated addresses.

## Activation of New Gauges

All pools, except for the VST stable pool `0x7bceaa9c5e7f4836fec3bce2d5346637c9b13970`, in the scope of this proposal will be incentivized as core pools outlined here by BIP-19.

The following pool’s owner are set to the DAO Address: `0xba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1b`

The transactions to complete this process will be executed by the LM Multisig via the gaugeAdder V2.

Address: `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`

## Execution Plan:

* The current gauges corresponding to the pools listed above will be killed by the DAO multisig 3 voting epochs from the approval of this proposal.

* The new gauges will go into effect as soon as reasonably possible, allowing adequate time for liquidity to migrate to the new pools.

* The next round of BIP-19 core pool incentives will apply to the new pool addresses respectively.

* All transactions will be executed by the LM Multisig to approve the new gauges.

* All transactions to kill the obsolete gauges will be executed by the DAO Multisig.",bearish
312,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-increase-aave-captier-from-cap5-to-uncapped-100m-uncapped/1353). If approved, changes would take effect at **00:00 UTC on Monday, March 8**.

This is a proposal to raise the liquidity mining cap from $100M to uncapped for $AAVE

# The Proposal

After the activation of the Balancer Based Safety Module 20 Days ago, the liquidity for $AAVE quickly grew to be the Largest Balancer protocol Liquidity Pool as new LPs join the AAVE/BAL incentivized Safety Module.

![image|690x101](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/464af158056f0a77cbf50195bfc2bb8a987826c1.png) 

Current APY by staking in the Safety Module is 29.34%, only considering the AAVE rewards, The Pool is still growing and Balancer is now the best protocol to swap AAVE onchain.

As BAL is a collateral option in Aave, aBPT stakers can use their BAL rewards to unlock more borrowing power in the Aave Protocol.

Uncapping the BAL rewards for the AAVE/ETH pool will allows even further incentive to bring more liquidity onchain and increase the synergies between the Aave & Balancer protocols.

# What is The Safety Module?

The Aave Safety Module acts as a collateral for the whole Aave ecosystem. AAVE holders, and now - with the new Balancer Based Stake - AAVE/ETH holders benefit from long term rewards for securing the protocol from insolvency, while at the same time bearing the risk of being slashed in case of shortfall events.
Having a very liquid onchain market and a consistent capital allocated in the Safety Module greatly increases the safety of the Aave ecosystem and the Aave protocol liquidity providers.",bullish
313,"## Motivation

For a refresher on what the Batch Relayer is you can review the proposal to [approve the Batch Relayer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-authorize-the-batch-relayer/2378) and to [approve the Batch Relayer v2](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-polygon-authorize-batch-relayer-v2-for-usd-boosted-pool/2655). The functionality added in v3 is primarily to aid in the coming migration of stabal3 and bb-a-USD to the soon to be deployed new version of bb-a-USD. This new bb-a-USD addresses the vulnerabilities previously disclosed [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/vulnerability-disclosure/3179) and also includes new features like [recovery mode](https://medium.com/@0xSkly/inside-balancer-code-recoverymode-9af34ce5ab72) and the ability to apply Balancer’s protocol fee to the Aave yield.

Additionally, the new Batch Relayer will have the ability to stake & unstake in the gauges on behalf of the user. This will allow the above mentioned migration to be completed in a single transaction (after the user has approved the Batch Relayer). It can also claim incentives from gauges on behalf of the user, opening the possibility for single-transaction claim-invest-stake flows.

**Summary:**
> This is a proposal on behalf of InceptionLRT to enable a gauge for instETH/wstETH on Ethereum. instETH is the Restaked Token dedicated to stETH, obtained through InceptionLRT's restaking mechanism and platform. 
InceptionLRT is an isolated Liquid Restaking protocol for Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), enabling the restaking of various LSTs with the initial focus on stETH and rETH. Its core feature is the issuance of Isolated Liquid Restaking Tokens (iLRTs) for each restaked LST.

**Protocol Description:**

> InceptionLRT is an isolated Liquid Restaking protocol for Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), enabling the restaking of various LSTs with the initial focus on stETH and rETH. Its core feature is the issuance of Isolated Liquid Restaking Tokens (iLRTs) for each restaked LST. 
These iLRTs can be freely traded and used in other DeFi protocols while maintaining segregation from the underlying LSTs. This architecture addresses potential risks associated with basket-based LRTs like increased complexity, counterparty risk, and often unclear pool rebalancing rules.
InceptionLRT is specifically designed to bolster the EigenLayer framework by addressing a critical challenge: the issue of liquidity locking in the protocol. This advancement positions InceptionLRT as a key player in enhancing the fluidity and accessibility of restaking in the DeFi landscape.


**Motivation:**

> InceptionLRT aims to enable a gauge for instETH/wstETH to substantially increase the liquidity of instETH, while supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.

**Specifications:**
 
>1. **Governance:** ING holders participate in decision-making, influencing the protocol’s direction and policies, including the Node Operators, AVSs and restaking strategies.
Incentive Allocation: Through gauge weight voting, veING holders direct incentives and rewards towards preferred liquidity, impacting the protocol's dynamics.
Rewards and Participation: Providing ING to liquidity pools like the 80-20 Balancer Liquidity Pools and locking the LP token earns veING, granting access to various protocol.
>2. **Oracles:** Rate Provider for [instETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x343281bb5029c4b698fe736d800115ac64d5de39#readContract).

## Summary

This is a proposal to enable a Balancer gauge for the 80% jAURA - 20% ETH pool on Ethereum Mainnet. jAURA is an auto-compounding wrapper token of the low-cost, partner-focused, vlAURA token.

As Aura launches on the Arbitrum Network, we will be using this pool to foster a familiar model that allows for ease of use and high adoption rate of both Balancer and Aura on Arbitrum. In a similar way, we plan on building upon the Balancer and Aura ecosystems through MetaVaults and other future integrations.

This strategy was co-developed alongside Redacted Cartel's Hidden Hand, with mentorship from Aura and Balancer. Special thank you’s to: Lamentations, Json, Sami, Solarcurve and Maha for helping us through ideation and finding equity with the Aura, Balancer, and Redacted communities.

jAURA provides, what we think, is a community service through its super efficient gas and retention structure as well as rebating back to the AURA team to help fund their ecosystem. Every single user who utilizes jAURA supports the AURA team.

## Protocol Description

Jones DAO is a **yield strategy, and liquidity protocol** with vaults that enable 1-click access to DeFi tools. These strategies unlock liquidity and capital efficiency through yield-bearing tokens.

Previously, Jones was focused solely on bringing users interested in Decentralized Options a simple, auto-pilot solution. The protocol has now expanded our focus, and explores many areas of yield generation, including Balancer & Aura.

## Motivation

Jones DAO believes that a Jones <> Aura strategy resulting from our partnership should be viewed as a public good. As such we have streamlined retention, delegated as much voting away as possible, and kept our incentives aligned with what we believe is a best-in-class DEX; Balancer. Alongside that, Jones plans to tithe the Aura Protocol with 0.69420% of the revenue generated by the product, which will go back into sustaining the Aura ecosystem. Increasing those revenues through providing boosted $BAL rewards further increases the support we can give to the Balancer ecosystem. 

By delegating to Redacted Finance’s Hidden Hand program, jAURA also automatically & efficiently collects Aura gauge voting incentives. We want to make sure that users and the community know that incentives will always align with the Balancer and Aura ecosystems. 

As such, our strategy minimizes what is needed to vote for this proposed pool to ensure that depositors in the LP have adequate incentives while not overbribing or attaching our $JONES token to the emissions - this is a public good in the first order and its important to underline this as the motivator.

Another very important part of the partnership is that we have chosen our LP as a direct competitor to Aura’s own AURA/ETH LP which, if as popular as we hope it will be, means less bribes will be necessary from the AURA team leading to slower inflation. A net benefit for ALL AURA holders.

## Specifications

**Governance**:

Jones DAO is currently governed by a core multi-sig and will transition some of that governance to veJONES holders when that launches in Summer ‘23.

**Oracles**:

Github: https://github.com/Jones-DAO/jaura-oracle

**Audits**:

The product has undergone internal testing using previously deployed code from our partners.

It has also received multiple rounds of Audit review from Solidity Finance.

Review here:

https://solidity.finance/audits/JonesAURA/

**Centralization Vectors**:

**The jAURA project will be run through smart contract interactions to be initiated or paused by the Jones multisig. As such there will be some governance control we retain however we have agreed to work with Aura in making the best decisions for the community.**

**Market History**:

The Jones protocol has been live since February 2022. We focus on real-yield strategies involving options, arbitrage, leverage, which results in vaults that are both unique and successful.

To date, we support 7 different tokens across several different strategies and as of writing, almost $40MM in TVL - https://defillama.com/protocol/jones-dao

**Value**:

If Balancer enables this gauge, we can expect this pool to provide exit liquidity at a reasonable cost to jAURA LP/Lockers which will be the first in a line of transparent legos for folks who want to participate in the growth of Balancer and Aura without the associated inconvenience of manually claiming and staking rewards.

In the future, this strategy can also be put in place on Arbitrum.

We will also be funneling revenue back to Aura, allowing them to help the Balancer ecosystem flourish and avoiding dilution events like capital raises.

**Contract**:

jAURA: 0x198d7387Fa97A73F05b8578CdEFf8F2A1f34Cd1F

320,"Hi everyone,

As explained in [this other post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/tribe-dao-unclaimable-bal-rewards/3196), the Tribe DAO now has a 2-contract setup to interact with the veBAL system:

* [VeBalDelegatorPCVDeposit](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4EAc760C2C631eE0b064E39888b89158ff808B2) vote-locks the 112,041 B-80BAL-20WETH tokens held by the DAO into veBAL
* [BalancerGaugeStaker](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf53e251352683155898295569d77b8506ba00d80) (behind [eip-1967 proxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x66977ce30049cd0e443216bf26377966c3a109e2)) to stake the protocol-owned liquidity BPTs in various gauges (e.g. the 252,865 B-70WETH-30FEI currently held)

This approach does not allow our gauge staking to benefit from veBAL boosting (that can boost BAL earned from the LM program by up to 2.5x if the staking is spread across enough gauges).

After discussions with the Balancer Labs team (and particularly Nicolas Venturo), a solution to this problem could be for the Balancer devs to deploy a new version VotingEscrowDelegation contract that include methods that allow the Tribe DAO to delegate its boost from the [VeBalDelegatorPCVDeposit](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4EAc760C2C631eE0b064E39888b89158ff808B2) to the [BalancerGaugeStaker eip-1967 proxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x66977ce30049cd0e443216bf26377966c3a109e2) (and hardcode the existing 6 boost delegations in the constructor of the new contract, to keep the same delegations during migration).

Would the Balancer DAO consider doing this small migration soon, before Convex-like platforms launch (at which point, a lot more boost delegations will happen, and migration will be harder) ?

Thanks,

Erwan

Nico:
We've deployed a version of the `VotingEscrowDelegation` which includes the following:

 - a fix for a [bug on the original Curve implementation](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-veBoost/pull/13)
 - a preseeding with [all of the boosts created until now](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220530-preseeded-voting-escrow-delegation/input.ts#L31) (these can be found by looking at interactions with the [current delegation contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2e96068b3d5b5bae3d7515da4a1d2e52d08a2647)
- a preseeding with [a call to set the address designated above as the operator of the TribeDAO contract](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220530-preseeded-voting-escrow-delegation/input.ts#L73). This will let the operator call `create_boost`, `extend_boost`, etc., using TribeDAO's veBAL balance.

The preseeding was executed in [this transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1e59b4c0b88757ed73a820b6586bfd25c0fa02d84baac5f04fad40085d553ea1), which can be inspected to look at the boosts created and approvals granted.

The address of the new delegator can be found [on the Balancer Labs repository](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220530-preseeded-voting-escrow-delegation/output/mainnet.json#L2). For a migration to happen, the delegation proxy's `setDelegation` function must be called from an authorized account (one with the permission `0xac0fcdc4520d7bde1c58bbefd7c8dd39aaf382a20c27991134c14fe63d2c96f3`).

It should be noted that any boosts created starting now will not be migrated as they're not included in the preseeding, and would require manual re-creation.",bullish
321,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal would put in place the ApeComms working group, which would provide full time AIP development assistance to community members in the ApeCoin ecosystem, educate and provide resources to community members about AIPs and other issues important to the ApeCoin DAO, assist the DAO administrators with communications, and develop a public discord.

[Link to ApeComms Pitch Deck](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFUCDlVqOk/view)

#### OVERALL COST

The total cost of this proposal is $ 114,129 USD for a 3 month term.

Please note: ApeComms is not taking custody of the total budget up front or in full. Contributors would be compensated directly by the Ape Foundation on a monthly basis. ApeComms Operating Fund amounts would only be accessed as needed. Breakdown of compensation vs operating fund is available below.

We have been advised by the administrators during our previous AIP submission that we should provide an exact day each month to receive compensation. For our purposes, the first day of every month would be ideal to receive team compensation. For the ApeComms Operating Fund, for which we will submit invoices to be paid by the Ape Foundation, we kindly request those be paid as needed. We were also advised by the administrators to request an amount in USD, which is why we have done so.

322,"As there has been renewed interest for buy and burn and the original discussion didn't allow for a choice between the two (governance participants had made a choice for distribution to veCRV holders), community members have asked us to resubmit those two options for a signalling vote.

**Important to note, the outcome of this signalling tool does not change the implementation of the admin fee (and its current vote https://dao.curve.fi/vote/parameter/2 ) , only how it will be distributed.**

**In light of recent manipulation in two different discourse polls (gold + buy and burn vs veCRV distribution), it's worth nothing discourse polls will not be considered anymore going forward.**

Read more and discuss: https://gov.curve.fi/t/cip-14-buy-and-burn-vs-distribution-to-vecrv-holders/759

Options:

1. **Buy and burn**  - Buy and burn would currently destroy around 5% (1.75% of daily circulation inflow) of the daily CRV inflation.

2. **veCRV holders Distribution** - Current locked supply is around 10% which could result in APY of over 250% meaning rough calculations suggest distribution to veCRV holders will likely remove selling pressure more effectively as people vote lock for their boost and receive fees. Seeing the total vote locked double from 10% to 20% seems realistic which would remove over 10% of the daily inflation against 1.75% for the buy and burn option.",bullish

326,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Back Highstreet ($HIGH) to Syrup Pool!

CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from **Highstreet**. Highstreet is an open-world metaverse that incorporates shopping, gaming, NFTs, traditional and crypto brands in a massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).

#### What is Boost?

Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, the HIGH-BUSD farm will go to a 1x multiple for 48 hours, then 0.5x thereafter. Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the boosted period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BSC, fundamental token issues, etc.
 
At the same time, there will be a delicious, new HIGH Syrup Pool with 168,600 HIGH tokens to be earned by staking CAKE. Get your CAKE ready!


#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn HIGH tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 168,600 HIGH
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on February 25th 2022
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on April 26th 2022
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.09756 HIGH

#### Max Stake per wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### What is $HIGH?

From the team: “Highstreet is a decentralized metaverse where brands - both traditional and crypto, can use their Merchant Portal to seamlessly integrate and build their presence in Highstreet World.

HIGH is Highstreet's native token which provides holders with in-game access for game progression and access to special events, serves as an in-game currency, and can be used for on-chain governance.”

327,"### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to introduce an NFT event check-in solution based on ApeChain, combining hardware products (NFC chips and scanners) and software products (an app based on ApeChain) to provide NFT holders with an immersive experience at all NFT offline events.

*Specific Implementation Plan:*

In terms of hardware products, we will use NFC technology combined with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) to embed NFC chips into peripheral products, including clothing, hats, toys, and skateboards. We will also design and manufacture NFC scanners to detect products with NFC chips and read selected NFT image data in an app based on ApeChain, then display on a large screen to realize the conceptual scenario of NFT as our web3 identity and participate in real offline events. Simultaneously, scanners will also be used to support the “Unmanned check-in” model in Merch stores.

In terms of software products, we will develop an app based on ApeChain, offering features such as wallet connecting, NFT selection, and animated scene corresponding to the ticket you purchased. The app will provide a user-friendly interface for NFT holders to easily use the check-in system. All check-in animations can be individually created and saved by users, forming a unique user-generated content (UGC) culture, which also makes it easier to spread within communities and out of the web3. For event organizers, animating event tickets to become a unique background for attendees can help expand the brand’s influence and generate much higher traffic than traditional marketing methods.

This solution will fully leverage the image of all NFTs, providing NFT holders with a more immersive experience and enriching existing methods of peripheral product distribution. It will create unique and native web3 gameplay during the offline events and provide all NFTs with more practical value beyond avatars.


### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The proposed NFT event check-in solution will bring several benefits to the APECHAIN ecosystem:

* Enhanced Adoption and Engagement: By providing NFT holders with an immersive experience at web3 offline events, the solution will increase adoption and engagement within the $APE ecosystem. NFT holders will feel more connected to the ecosystem and be incentivized to participate in events and activities.
* Increased Visibility and Recognition: The innovative nature of the check-in solution, coupled with its use of ApeChain, will enhance the visibility and recognition of $APE in the broader market. This will attract more users, projects, and potential collaborators to the ecosystem, driving its growth and fostering a vibrant community.
* Diversification of Use Cases: The check-in solution will demonstrate the versatility of $APE beyond where we are right now, showcasing its potential in the realm of NFT event management and engagement. This diversification of use cases will attract new projects and investors to $APE, expanding its reach and utility.

Overall, the NFT event check-in solution will contribute to the growth and development of the APE CHAIN ecosystem, defining APE CHAIN as the primary chain for all NFTs and continuously providing value for all $APE holders.



### OVERALL COST 
Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 480,000 $APE The specific allocation is as follows:

1. Hardware Design and Production (50% of the budget, 240,000 $APE):

    * User Experience Optimization: 9,600 $APE
* Entrance Animation Creation and Display Function: 28,800 $APE
    * Animation Design and Development: 19,200 $APE
    * Animation Display Technology Integration: 9,600 $APE

3. User Testing, Promotion, and Launch (10% of the budget, 48,000 $APE):
* User Testing and Feedback Collection: 19,200$APE
    * User Testing Planning and Execution: 9,600 $APE
    * User Feedback Collection and Analysis: 9,600 $APE
* Product Promotion and Marketing: 19,200 $APE
    * Social Media Marketing: 9,600 $APE
    * Online and Offline Event Promotion: 9,600 $APE
* Launch Preparation and Support: 9,600 $APE
    * Platform Launch Preparation: 4,800 $APE
    * Technical Support and Maintenance: 4,800 $APE

This detailed description of fund allocation will ensure the smooth development, testing, and promotion of both hardware and software products, guarantee the high quality and user satisfaction of the final product.
We do not have an estimate of costs for users to use the app’s features at the moment; we will know the cost range once the app development is complete and we begin the user testing phase.

##### APECOIN REVENUE MODEL:
Single Instance Revenue Forecast

![Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 4.58.59 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreifltrbdt2idzmxfeipb6il7veqa5nzfw3lagkxvj2hh6snljhq2a4)
    
##### Total Revenue:* 120,000 $APE + Total Revenue * 1%

This table clearly outlines the revenue forecast for a single instance, providing a comprehensive view of the potential earnings from our proposed solution.

*50% of gross revenues will be returned to APECOIN DAO, in perpetuity.

NOTE:
* Fees will be charged for the services provided by the check-in solution and “Unmanned check-in” model, and only $APE will be used for payment.
* Offline merch stores adopting the “Unmanned check-in” model can only be paid with $APE.
* NFC customization will be charged separately and paid for using $APE.
* $APE will be consumed in the APP as Gas fee

By implementing this proposal, APECOIN will establish a robust check-in solution that benefits NFT holders, drives revenue growth, and expands its influence in the web3 space.

**TL:DR**

As outlined in the [new whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the UNI capFactor from cap1 to cap2 ($1M -> $3M).

**The Proposal**

This is a proposal to increase the UNI cap tier from cap1 to cap2. UNI currently has >$1.8M in adjusted liquidity and has surpassed its $1M cap essentially since its inception.

Uniswap is one of the oldest and most respected projects on Ethereum; this may make it deserving of a higher cap tier on Balancer.

329,"Would you like to have 100% protection against volatility for your crypto?? This could be done using the new Concentrated Liquidity of v3 by just changing or adding a few things! 

Imagine adding liquidity to the ETH/USDC pair for example (50% of each), and in case the ETH price drops and gets out of your range, your capital is turned 100% into USDC!! This way you would be 100% PROTECTED against LOSSES! And in case the ETH price goes up again and completely crosses your range in an upward direction, your capital would be automatically swaped 100% into ETH!!

You could even manually FOLLOW or TRAIL the ETH price every time it goes up, by removing and adding a new liquidity range at a higher price, and this could help you MAXIMIZE YOUR PROFITS!! You could very efficiently trade tops like this! Just imagine trading perfectly the ETH TOP of this Bull market! Either if it is 10k, 15k, or 20k, you could just follow it and trade it perfectly!! And after it drops, you can continue to follow the price, GROWING YOUR CAPITAL thanks to a high yield from fees, and volatility itself! Knowing your capital is always completely PROTECTED against ANY LOSSES!!

The problem now is that the direction of the swaps inside a liquidity range are exactly the opposite as they should be... Using the same example, if the ETH price drops out of your range, your capital is swaped 100% into ETH, and if the price goes up and gets out of the range, your capital is 100% swaped into USDC... It should be the exact opposite!

So this is a PROPOSAL to change the direction the swaps are made inside a liquidity range to the exact opposite they are now, or to at least let the users choose the direction of the swaps when they add liquidity to the pools or create ranged orders.

If we make this change, it would be DISRUPTIVE and Uniswap will completely BREAK all other DEXs and CEXs!! People would LOOSE the FEAR of loosing their money because of volatility!! This would easily help with crypto's mass adoption!! And it will definitely drive more LPs to v3!! Please think about it and support this proposal! Thanks!!",bearish
330,"## Intro

Following the developments after the [DNS hack reported here](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/dns-security-incident-post-mortem-1b1feb735aca), and given the precedent set by [BIP-443](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-443-restore-brand-trust-in-balancer-by-assisting-dns-hack-users/5218) and [BIP-455](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-455-assisting-dns-hack-victims/5259), this proposal seeks to refund affected users by the frontend attack with 25% cut.

## Motivation

After refunds of BIP-443 and BIP-455, only 1 (one) user came forward publicly reporting the loss of funds due to the DNS attack. There could potentially be others that might be waiting for the formation of the volunteer committee described on BIP-433 and/or the public announcement of a claiming window.

Given the past refund allocations and known wallets impacted, the expenditure shouldn’t be greater than 34k, even though the program would still have 110.578,95 USDC provisioned. We find it would be better to put this program behind us and therefore suggest using the same deadline in the [[BIP-445] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-445-decide-on-direction-of-restitution-for-affected-lps-in-boosted-pool-incident/5187)regarding the Boosted Pools incident.

## Specification

This proposal will override the specifications on BIP-443, and shall be voted as follows:

1. Affected users will have until Dec 25th, 2023 to post on this thread (or by any means reach out to the Balancer Maxis), being this a final deadline to ask for refunds in a final payment batch coming January.
2. To verify claims, the Balancer Maxis will cross-reference the user’s reported transactions with the [spreadsheet ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nby6q2kyA9PSvrKeMSJtRIFllxzlOHAT96SE38fnGxA/edit#gid=593597477)made public in the incident post-mortem.
3. Users will be asked to verify wallet ownership with a signed message on chain agreeing to the 75% cut and payment in USDC at the time of the attacks (precedent set by BIP-443).
4. Final numbers will be posted in January’24 on a new BIP authorizing payments.

*If passed, this proposal shall be posted by our Marketing team on Discord and Twitter, as well as any interested media outlets, for max comms amplification regarding the deadline.*",neutral
331,"CAKE is still too inflationary and reducing the emission by like 0.5 CAKE per block once a month imo is not enough. I understand that the developers are trying to protect the pool APYs but the performance of CAKE and the community feedback I see on Reddit tells me that we need quicker reductions.

I suggest to introduce halvings to CAKE. Automatically reduce the emission by 50% every 864,000 blocks (approx. once a month).

It's the Bitcoin halvings that initiate each crypto bull market and it has proven itself to be a working concept. It doesn't negatively affect the income of miners at all as the halvings result in an increasing price and I think the same will apply to the pool APYs. Farmers earn less CAKE but the price becomes higher, so the APY will fix itself. The only APY that could highly flactuate is of CAKE pools but we will see former farmers leaving or new farmers joining to fix this one as well. Also could we have community votings on adjusting the multiplier of CAKE pools to make these more profitable again.

Halvings would also help investors feeling more safe on their CAKE investment because they know exactly when the next reduction happens and how high this reduction is.

I think that CAKE is essential for PancakeSwap as a platform to survive and hence I highly suggest to put more effort into the success of the token.",bullish

333,"# PancakeSwap Welcomes Moonpot to Syrup Pool!


CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from Moonpot, a win-win lottery on Binance Smart Chain where every ticket earns you interest.


# The Syrup Pool:
Stake CAKE tokens to earn POTS tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 150,000 POTS
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start block:**  9876760 [**(approx. 9am UTC on August 9th)**](https://www.bscscan.com/block/countdown/9876760)
- **Finish block:** 11604760 [**(approx. 9am UTC on October 10th)**](https://www.bscscan.com/block/countdown/11604760)
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.0868 POTS


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.


# The Farm:
In order to host the POTS Syrup Pool, we will need to provide a POTS-BNB farm that will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours and then 0.5x CAKE rewards after that. 


# What is Moonpot?

Moonpot is a win-win prize game on Binance Smart Chain powered by Beefy Finance. 

Deposit crypto into one of their Moonpots and you automatically gain interest on your assets each day. You are also entered into a weekly prize draw at the same time. Everyone in each pot is in with a chance of winning big-money Moonpot prizes paid out in crypto. The CAKE Moonpot currently has a weekly prize of $220,000 paid out in CAKE and POTS.

So how does it work? Put simply, your deposit is your ticket for the prize draw. But even if you don't win you can always get your crypto back with added interest. 

Please note there is a 10-day Fairplay Timelock on your deposit, or payment of a 2.5% Fairness Fee (or less) if you would like to exit early. Winnings are also subject to the Fairplay Timelock with a Fairness Fee of a maximum of 5%.

# How do you stake CAKE to earn POTS rewards on PancakeSwap?
If you own CAKE tokens, congratulations! You’re the master of your … pancakes.
Time to step up your taste buds by learning how to stake CAKE with Syrup Pool.
- Visit this webpage: [**https://pancakeswap.finance/syrup** ](https://pancakeswap.finance/syrup )
- Click “Approve CAKE” on the POTS Syrup Pool 
- Click on the stake button.
- Confirm the transaction.

BEP20 POTS will also be circulating and transferable on BSC when we start the Syrup pool, so you will be able to harvest your POTS tokens and trade on PancakeSwap at any time!



# BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING! ⚠️⚠️⚠️💀

The official POTS token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:

Any other POTS token will be a scam and will result in a financial loss for users. Do not buy tokens from any other token address. Always verify the token address before purchasing tokens. If you receive airdrops from another address for POTS tokens, they will be rotten tokens (but not the cool kind!), and we advise you to ignore them.",bullish

**Protocol Description:**

See here: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708

Centered around [@BalancerLabs](https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs)’s veBAL, Aura coordinates incentives around vote-escrowed tokens to boost yield potential and governance power of DeFi liquidity providers, governance token stakers and voters.

**Motivation:**

The synergies between Balancer and Aura are widely known. The approval of this gauge for the 50/50 AURA/ETH pool will set Aura up for a successful launch period and continue to provide deep liquidity for AURA in the years to come.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

Aura is a non custodial, non pausable platform.

Title: [ARFC] Cancel Llama Service Provider Stream 
Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative
Date: 2023-07-30
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes to cancel the Llama stream from the Aave DAO

## Motivation

Llama has historically been a service provider for the Aave DAO and has made numerous contributions. However, during their tenure, there have been several instances where Llama's performance has fallen short of expectations. 

For instance:

* Llama's handling of the crucial CRV AIP was a clear demonstration of their inability to deliver a much-needed payload in a timely manner. The delay in execution resulted in an additional cost of approximately $1 million for the DAO due to the increased valuation of CRV. This incident underscores the need for service providers who can reliably deliver on their commitments and highlights Llama's underqualification for the task at hand.
* Despite receiving $1.5 million from the DAO, Llama charged third parties for consulting services related to Aave, including teams seeking asset listings.
* As treasury managers, Llama failed to ensure that the collector contract had an adequate aUSDC balance. This oversight resulted in several service providers going unpaid for weeks, tarnishing the DAO's brand and reputation..

Given these circumstances, we believe that the most beneficial course of action for the Aave DAO is to end our relationship with Llama. This will allow the DAO to reassess its needs and budget for a new service provider.

The ACI and other service providers will complete any outstanding tasks from Llama's engagement at no additional cost to the DAO.

By terminating Llama's stream early, the DAO treasury can save up to approximately $240k. These funds can then be reallocated to other initiatives, ensuring the most efficient use of the DAO's resources.


## Specification

The AIP will call the `cancelStream()` method of the Ecosystem Reserve and Aave Collector contracts. The details are as follows:

- Ecosystem Reserve Contract: `0x25F2226B597E8F9514B3F68F00f494cF4f286491`
- Stream: `100001`
- Aave Collector Contract: `0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c`
- Stream: `100003`
- Address: `0xb428C6812E53F843185986472bb7c1E25632e0f7`

340,"As we continue to optimize CAKE rewards across all of our deployments, we are able to gradually lower the overall CAKE emission, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate a smooth trading experience. Ultimately, this enables us to contribute a greater amount of CAKE towards the weekly burn. 

Given PancakeSwap’s positive market growth across our v3 deployments as well to keep our Farms’ APR competitive against other liquidity venues, this proposal aims to decrease CAKE emission to Farms across all chains.

The previous round of [**Adjustments to Farm Rewards**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0xc3c48f2e4de3916bb5ad4d54681658b4a3940525dd1bf23eadc82aa3f3fa8ae0) increased the overall CAKE burn by approximately **1,150 CAKE per day** with minimal impact to trading volumes. This proposal aims to decrease emissions and increase the overall CAKE burn by approximately **4,000 CAKE per day**.

As time passes, this optimization will help to 1) improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across Farms and 2) continue to make CAKE deflationary.

#### Adjustment Details

With the above in mind, we are proposing to apply the following adjustments:
1. Reduce Farm emissions by 12.5% across all 8 chains (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Aptos, zkSync, Base, Arbitrum, Linea, and Polygon zkEVM)
2. BNB Chain’s core Farms will have their CAKE emissions reduced by 17.5% instead (including: BNB-USDT, BNB-BUSD, BUSD-USDT, USDC-USDT, USDC-BUSD, CAKE-BNB, CAKE-USDT, BTC-BUSD, BTC-USDT, ETH-USDT, BTC-BNB, ETH-BNB, and BTC-ETH)
3. Direct all the reduced CAKE emissions to increase our weekly burn

The purpose of this adjustment is to further turn CAKE deflationary while keeping our Farms’ APR more or less unchanged.",bullish
341,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust six (6) total risk parameters including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. In addition, Gauntlet recommends freezing legacy KNC. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.

This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

## Specification


Our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. 

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| DAI Loan To Value     | 75%     | 77%     |
| LINK Liquidation Bonus     | 6.5%     | 6.3%     |

| USDC Liquidation Threshold    | 85%     | 86%     |



See below volatility and exchange volume data from 03/17 to 03/31. These are useful metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations.

## Freezing Legacy KNC

The KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20/2021, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 3/28/2022, roughly 195M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdefa4e8a7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 57M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There are currently $2.9M KNCL supplied and $900K total borrowed on Aave v2.

Considering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.

343,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-pickle-finance-in-vebal-s-votingescrow/3182)


## Vision

[Pickle Finance][2] aims to become the home for Balancer LPs to enjoy the best possible returns and to become a major collaborator in the governance of the Balancer Protocol. 

## Abstract

Pickle is building a module on top of Balancer's Gauge system that seeks to aid Balancer LPs and prospective `veBAL` participants in maximising the utility of their deposits with Balancer, while also enhancing the overall utility of the Balancer's Gauge system by creating a liquid `veBAL` derivative.

Similar to other ""boosting protocols"", Pickle aims to create these synergies by providing an easy mechanism for the aggregation of `veBAL` boosts and for prospective Balancer LPs to benefit from this boost.

The Pickle and Balancer teams are no strangers to each other, with Pickle being invited and expressing its willingness to join the Balancer Wars as early as the Gauge system was announced. Pickle has borrowed from its unique experience running a Gauge system for itself and building on top of other boosting modules like Convex to come up with a unique system we call the Brinery. 

As a gesture of goodwill and to encourage the creation and adoption of the Balancer Brinery, Pickle will be providing incentives (in `$PICKLE` tokens) to both those who vote to whitelist us and those who join the Brinery early on. These incentives will be detailed pending their approval by Pickle governance. The Balancer community can expect the Pickle Core team to propose between 2-3% of the `PICKLE` supply to be awarded to Balancer Brinery incentives, with rougly 80% of these reserved for joiners and 20% for voters.

This proposal makes no request to the Balancer community for financial assistance to Pickle. We are a solvent, revenue-generating protocol with a healthy balance sheet. Our interest is in providing a superior service to Balancer users and to create a symbiotic relationship between our communities.

## Brinery Specification: Architecture & Design

The Brinery will provide a seamless experience for users to join `veBAL`. Our proposed system works in the following manner: 
1. Users deposit 80/20 BAL/ETH `BPT` with Pickle
2. Users receive **brinBAL** in return
3. Under the hood, Pickle will:
  a) Lock up a portion of `BAL/ETH` for `veBAL` in perpetuity - a receipt token is issued for the locked amount as **pveBAL**. A portion of `BAL/ETH` liquidity is retained
  b) Supply `pveBAL` and retained `BAL/ETH` into a new Balancer pool
4. Users can redeem `brinBAL` for their proportionate share of `pveBAL` and `BAL/ETH` (or in a single asset if they wish)

This design has the advantage of guaranteeing liquidity for Pickle's `veBAL` derivative. The Brinery contracts will have flexibility in managing liquidity to achieve the proper balance between liquidity and maximal rewards. Users who hold `brinBAL` will receive Balancer governance rewards (all fee-sharing rewards, emissions, and bribe proceeds will be consolidated into BAL tokens), the Brinery's ""flywheel"" rewards (`BAL` ""taxed"" from Brinery boosted PickleJars), and of course `PICKLE` tokens. 

For users familiar with our standard PickleJar, a series of Brinery Boosted Jars, or ""brinJars"", will be on offer to compound users' BPT positions, taking advantage of boosted rewards from the Brinery's `veBAL` lock, alongside `PICKLE` incentives. These novel Balancer Jars will rely on state-of-the-art infrastructure and comply with the EIP-4626 standard for maximal efficiency, security, and composability. 

## Pickle

### History

Pickle is one of the original yield aggregators in DeFi, bringing innovations such as incentivised auto-farming with its PickleJars. We have been building as an Ethereum-based DAO since September 2020. Our builders are well-known and have collaborated over their time in DeFi with many top-notch protocols and teams to build, conduct security reviews, or brainstorm and validate ideas. To name a few: Yearn, Sushi, Curve, Polygon, Frax, Alchemix, and of course, Balancer.

Pickle has crossed paths with Balancer on several occasions. Pickle was the first yield aggregator to build on top of Balancer on its launch in Polygon. Moreover, our `PICKLE-ETH` was only the second pool after `BAL-ETH` to launch with Balancer on Arbitrum. A cursory look at the [BAL mining scripts on GitHub][1] shows we are 1 of 11 Balancer partners. On Arbitrum, we are 1 of 3. We are brethren in DeFi and hope to remain so for many years to come.

Finally, Pickle was the first-ever protocol to adapt Curve's Gauge system to align its users and token holders into a better governance system we call `DILL`. More than 51% of all `PICKLE` is currently locked for an average of 3.23 years, with almost 1,000 `DILL` holders forming the DAO that backs our protocol.

### Team

Pickle is led by myself, joined by the rest of the core team which currently consists of another 12 individuals with a wide range of skills in product, product marketing, UX design, smart contracts engineering, and frontend and Web3 infrastructure development. 

### Governance

Pickle is run according to the principle of ""progressive decentralisation"" by the DILL DAO. DILL governance is currently upgrading so DILL holders receive 100% of protocol revenues generated by Pickle, in ETH, plus PICKLE anti-dilutive rewards. At present, using Pickle's Gauge system, DILL holders can vote on-chain for where PICKLE emissions should go. With support for delegation currently in development, Pickle aims to launch its own ""Pickle voting module"" so users can participate in governance, including PICKLE emission allocations across sidechains, via secure offchain voting.

The Pickle voting module to provide DILL holders an interface for directing `veBAL` voting power held by Pickle's Balancer Brinery, as well as select the allocation of PICKLE emissions amongst our various Brinery products.

344,"The M-Token team proposes adding a [MBTC, [sBTC pool]] Metapool. Adding a MBTC pool will further increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum and make it easier to swap between assets.

Hello everyone,

We are M-Token team. Today, we would like to introduce M-Tokens, and initiate the proposal to add the MBTC Metapool on the Curve platform.
First of all, MBTC is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum issued by M-Tokens on a 1:1 basis peg to actual Bitcoin. This enables seamless integration of crypto assets on other blockchains into the Ethereum ecosystem and brings the community another choice to enjoy the cross-chain transaction with convenience, transparency, and value.

All M-Tokens reserves are safeguarded by qualified custodians. At the current stage, M-Token is supported by Cactus Custody, who manages private keys in the industry high-level HSMs and its proprietary multi-tiered storage system by the tier-4 grade data centers across three continents. Its segregation of duty and zero-trust system design can guarantee the safety and availability of the assets without dependency on any single individual. Meanwhile, a multi-signature mechanism is adopted by M-Tokens for its crucial aspects such as mining and burning, allowing on-the-chain verification. Thus, it provides cross-chain asset services that are both transparent and reliable. Major parties taking part in M-Tokens include the governing bodies, custodians, merchants, and the end users.

In terms of technical aspects, smart contact and hash mapping are adopted. Simultaneously, the reserve deposit addresses, outstanding balances, and transaction records are made 100% public and traceable to enable exact cross-chain mapping. In terms of governance, checks and balances are achieved through a multi-institutional framework, roles/rights segregation, and decentralization, facilitating the prevention of malice committed by any individual or entity. Moreover, the blacklisting mechanism lays a foundation for ongoing governance and regulatory compliance.

M-Token has currently collaborated with SynFutures protocol, where its users can use MBTC to trade the derivatives product on the platform. M-Token has also partnered with Matrixport on industry-leading crypto financial solutions, which will empower M-Token with the capacity of yield generating in the future. Most importantly, the capability to conduct structural products and become a gateway between DeFi and CeFi will be the parts we focus on, and it definitely is our unique advantage.

We believe that adding the MBTC pool will increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum, and enable the BTC holders invest their assets into Ethereum projects in a convenient, speedy and cost-effective manner.

Audits Security Reviews:
M-Tokens & MBTC has been audited by Peckshield. 

MBTC Market Cap: [Will be updated]
Currently, MBTC total supply is “200”.

347,"## Karpatkey Balancer Treasury CU Proposal

## Background

This is a proposal to provide limited delegation of the Balancer treasury to [Karpatkey DAO](http://www.karpatkey.com) in a non-custodial, trust-minimised way.

Karpatkey is a DeFi native DAO that has been constantly evolving to maximise capital efficiency, manage risk, increase security and optimise yield by combining industry-leading research with best-in-class tooling to prevent collateral liquidation. 

Our operation would be completely transparent at all times, and any member of Balancer DAO would be able to monitor it on-chain and through the weekly reports posted on the Balancer Forum. \
Also, Karpatkey would suggest the creation of a Treasury Core Unit (CU) within Balancer DAO. If Balancer DAO approves this initiative, we would hire full time contributors to work exclusively with Balancer under our guidance and training. The scope of the CU would be determined after the assessment meetings where Karpatkey would find out Balancer’s needs. \
Karpatkey has been supporting Balancer since 2020, by being a top liquidity provider of ETH and stablecoins, and participating in governance, successfuly proposing a [GNO-BAL treasury swap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/2110).

As a token of our long term commitment and financial alignment with Balancer, the performance fee (detailed below) would be charged in BAL and vested for 1 year. We intend to _hodl_ the collected BAL, and we would transparently report on our BAL holdings.

### Motivation

In order to focus on its core business, Balancer DAO must secure enough runway to keep developing its market-leading products, regardless of economic junctures. \
An idle fund has a significant opportunity cost (e.g.: circa USD 120,000 a month for a $20M treasury at current market values). Therefore, delegating limited access of the treasury to a specialised DAO such as Karpatkey would optimise its growth through carefully curated and tailored strategies within a risk-controlled framework.

The chart below shows our past performance managing the treasury of our main user, GnosisDAO, when the main goal was to obtain a sustainable growth of funds with a low exposure to risk, before the focus was shifted to maximising the growth of the Gnosis Chain. As the chart illustrates, the yield obtained by Karpatkey’s strategies was greater than the yield of all the other DAOs in the ecosystem put together.

## Core Proposal
### Trust-Minimised Fund Allocation Strategy

The process of fund allocation starts by Karpatkey DAO proposing a list of allowed protocols on Balancer DAO Snapshot, which must be approved by the majority of token holders. Once this happens, the target addresses and transactions’ call data associated with such protocols will be allowlisted in a smart contract, so that funds are always under Balancer DAO’s custody. As a result, Balancer DAO will have the power to withdraw or transfer funds without Karpatkey’s intervention.

If Balancer DAO has a specific need which wasn’t included in the approved strategy, such as incentives/rewards, payments, etc., Karpatkey would post another ad-hoc strategy including the additional services for Balancer DAO to approve. \
An alternative would be to operate with trusted signers from Balancer, using the Safe multisignature wallet. Karpatkey would not hold enough signatures to be able to execute transactions on its own. Therefore, approval from Balancer signers would always be necessary.

We would put together a periodically reviewed emergency withdrawal protocol to be able to quickly derisk/liquidate/swap all positions in the event of a market crash, hack or any fortuitous event that requires to stop loss.

Karpatkey DAO’s professional treasury development consists of carrying out tailored strategies that vary twice a week, adjusting to the constantly changing DeFi market.

#### Daily Strategy Reevaluation 

Each step of the strategies would be designed and monitored daily by our research team, keeping in mind different risks and opportunities. 

#### Impermanent/Divergence Loss

To minimise the risk of Impermanent or Divergence Loss, we carry out the following tasks:

* Identification of profitable and low IL pools (assessment of assets’ correlation evolution)
* Definition of thresholds for exit strategies
* Accurate IL tracking*, also considering different variations of deposited volumes  over time.

*The way in which we calculate IL differs across protocols and specific cases within protocols, but it’s primordially based on the formula detailed below, which calculates the IL per LP token for any AMM with constant swap fees. Our Financial Engineering team is currently preparing a paper on  the equations that we use for IL calculation in different cases, encompassing single isolated financial positions and more complex positions including composability.

###

Impermanent loss evolution tracking example:
 
![IL Evolution.jpg](ipfs://bafkreihklmyqpr7qb72cct2it4jdvb442kvfjrcwd3o36gke33xhewzq5u)

### Treasury Core Unit

After reviewing Balancer DAO’s structure, we came to the conclusion that creating a Treasury Core Unit (CU) would increase the efficiency of the overall management of the tokens held in the treasury. If Balancer DAO agrees, this CU would be composed by full time contributors that would be sourced and recruited with Karpatkey DAO’s support. \
The CU members would be trained and assisted by Karpatkey DAO, observing strict security standards. They could be on Karpatkey DAO’s payroll and would be in charge of the following tasks (among others):



* **Balancer Value Proposition:** Improve the value proposition of Balancer and the Balancer DAO treasury
* **Availability:** Increase Balancer availability on other networks and markets
* **Liquidity:** Increasing Balancer liquidity so more traders and investors can acquire it with a lower price impact
* **Balancer Health Monitoring:** Propose buybacks if we consider Balancer is undervalued
* **Fund Proposals:** Any proposal involving funding will be comprehensively analysed by the CU to plan how token transfers should take place in a timeline, and ensure that liquidity requirements are met and executed properly
* **Fund OPEX:** All of Balancer DAO’s operating expenses will be analysed and projected to meet liquidity requirements and make timely transfers if needed
* **Drafting and Maintenance of an Emergency Token Withdrawal Protocol:** In case of a sudden black swan market event, the team will execute a carefully structured protocol to de-risk all positions and avoid losing funds. This protocol will be periodically updated to ensure it’s ready to be executed at all times
* **Capital Optimisation:** CDPs will be continuously monitored and managed to prevent liquidation (more details in the Risk Management section below)
* **Reporting:** Dashboard creation and maintenance to monitor the yield of investments, rewards distribution and overall treasury growth trend, health and diversification
* **Bridge Monitoring:** analysis of funds allocation to allow the Balancer token to be transferred across networks without friction.

### Yield Strategy

The yield strategy would vary weekly to keep it within target. It would resort to different combinations of staking derivatives solutions, AMM, same asset leveraged in money markets, carry trade, arbitrages, etc. Given the risk that it entails, we don’t do trading.

In alignment with Balancer’s treasury allocation policy, the strategy would not extract  value from directly competing protocols. The following protocols would be considered to obtain an adequately diversified yield strategy with low risk and reduced ETH price exposure. This is just a sample list, the final one would follow Balancer DAO’s preferences and risk profile:

Aave, Agave, Ankr, Aura, Balancer, Bancor, Compound, Element, Honeyswap, Idle, Lido, Liquity, Maker, Nexus Mutual, QiDAO, Reflexer, Rocket pool, Stakewise, Sushiswap, Swapr, Symmetric, Synthetix, Uniswap, Unit.

### Reporting

Karpatkey DAO will post a weekly treasury development report on the Balancer forum, and support in identifying data elements upon request from the Balancer community. Also, Karpatkey DAO would review data reported and assist in performing analytics and quality reviews to confirm the accuracy of the information.

The following metrics would be included:

* **Portfolio Summary:** shows the current holdings in USD and ETH equivalent, considering the allocation by blockchain, as well as the allocation of the most relevant assets
* **Revenues:** shows the performance of the portfolio strategy, displaying the current APR, annual revenues, capital utilisation and past performance
* **Positions:** shows the complete strategy implemented for the considered time period, explaining the type of investments, protocols, underlying assets, expected APR and expected revenues
* **Loans Management:** shows the loan strategy to quickly assess the health status of the active loans, considering the borrowed assets and funds, the lent assets and funds, the collateral ratio and the minimum (liquidation) collateral ratio
* **Portfolio details:** shows the complete composition of the portfolio by type of asset
* **Improvement Proposals:** shows the list of executed proposals, as well as a summary of the weight of each proposal
* **Incentives program:** shows the incentives strategy, displaying the amount of assets used on each protocol.

### Fees

Karpatkey DAO will charge the following fees, which have been adjusted to make this proposal self-financing, without burdening Balancer DAO’s growth:

#### Management fee

A yearly management fee (in monthly instalments) of 0.5% of the AUM would be charged to finance fixed costs like hiring full time contributors to Balancer DAO.

#### Performance fee

We’d charge a monthly performance fee of 20% of the yield obtained during the last month in BAL tokens, and every payment will have a vesting period of 1 year. We intend to hold it long term, as a token of our commitment to Balancer.

### Termination

Balancer may terminate Karpatkey DAO’s engagement under this agreement for any reason by way of Governance Mechanism. Kapatkey DAO may terminate this agreement upon four week’s notice posted as a new discussion thread in the Balancer forum. In case the termination is requested by Balancer without at least a 4 week notice, Karpatkey DAO will be granted an exit fee equal to the fees collected during the last 2 months, which will be paid in ETH. Regular fees will be collected until the day of termination.


### Custody of Funds

Karpatkey DAO is not a custodian of funds. The funds will be in possession of authorised signers of Balancer at all times. Karpatkey DAO will sign transactions using two addresses, which won’t suffice to execute transactions.

Karpatkey DAO is not responsible for the loss of funds caused by the existence, identification and/or exploitation of vulnerabilities through hacks, mining attacks (including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or other security breaches, attacks or deficiencies with smart contracts or protocols which are not owned by Balancer or Karpatkey DAO.

The plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion by Balancer and may need to be (re)structured to take account of legal, regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations. This document should not be taken as the basis for making investment decisions, nor be construed as a recommendation to engage in any transactions.


## Dependencies

Upon approval of this proposal, Karpatkey DAO would post a yield strategy in Balancer’s Snapshot, holding a broad list of protocol options without granular specification of parameters nor exact moment when transactions would be executed. We would then operate within those boundaries, without having to go through a DAO-wide vote on every trade, while ensuring that only transactions approved by Balancer DAO could be carried out by Karpatkey DAO. \
Alternatively, at least one trusted signer should be appointed by Balancer to approve each transaction. This could be a member of the Treasury Core Unit.

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Management

Every decision made and action taken weighs in risk exposure. Most large treasury holders have one thing in common: risk aversion. At Karpatkey DAO, we go above and beyond standard risk assessment protocols, and we have developed a multilevel approach to curate yield strategies, assess protocols and carry out transactions safely.

348,"This proposal is a continuation of the topic from VIP-51. Previously, several VRT Swap & XVS Vesting architecture designs were proposed that differed from the original design summarized in the Venus Tokenomics 2 published in August of 2021. One of these alternative designs, referred to as “fixed speed vesting” proposed a vesting schedule that would have allowed all XVS to vest very quickly if VRT was separated into a multitude of accounts and deposited separately. This potential workaround required a countermeasure in the form of a global daily limit on all deposits. Many in the community pointed out concerns regarding this daily limit from a technical and user experience perspective.

We considered feedback regarding the daily limit and how this unfairly allows those with bots to consume the daily quota before everyone else each day. There is no technically feasible way to prevent this issue with the fixed speed model, so we are proposing deployment of the original swap & vesting design.

Title: [ARFC] BUSD Offboarding Plan Part III
Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative
Date: 2023-07-25
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposal outlines the third part of the offboarding plan for BUSD on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The plan aims to further reduce the amount of liquidity in BUSD and encourage users to switch to other stablecoins. The plan involves modification of BUSD risk parameters and withdrawal of aBUSD from the collector contract. The plan will be enforced in a single AIP.

## Motivation

Please refer to the first and second parts of the BUSD offboarding plan for more context. The first two parts of the plan were successful, driving out liquidity and incentivizing active users to repay their debt and move their position to other stablecoins. The remaining vBUSD debt holders seem to be inactive or unaffected by high rates, due to the time-sensitive nature of BUSD/Paxos situation and the potential risk of protocol bad debt.

This third part of the offboarding plan will concentrate efforts on creating unsustainable positions for remaining borrowers to either motivate them enough to repay or reach liquidation thresholds.

Both actions are proposed to be performed:

- Modify risk parameters to “force” slope 2 interest rate curve and increase slope 2 aggressiveness
- Remove aBUSD from the collector contract to increase the utilization ratio of BUSD and increase the cost of open positions.

## Specification

The offboarding plan will be carried out in a single AIP with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| uOptimal | 1% |
| Reserve Factor | 99.9% |
| Base Rate | 100% |
| Slope 1 | 70% |
| Slope 2 | 300% |

This will result in a 470% APR cost at 100% utilization rate.

Withdrawal of aBUSD from the collector contract. The BUSD will be kept as such in the collector contract, and a separate AIP will organize the swap of BUSD into other assets at a later stage.

## Next Steps

1. If the community approves ARFC, Publication of an AIP implementation.

Other Ideas
In addition to their ambitious plans for apps, the team intends to create a website enabling the buying and selling of NFTs using Rich Token. This development will progress alongside the apps, with the release date being collaboratively determined in coordination with the community. Stay tuned for updates as we embark on this exciting journey together!

Tokens
To support growth and development, 70% of Rich Tokens will be utilized for initiating new liquidity pools, listing on additional exchanges, funding marketing efforts, and real utility applications. 

Tokens allocated to pools will be locked for a duration of 12–24 months, ensuring stability. 

The remaining tokens will be distributed to current and future team members, or to other applications that can increase project value; however, no tokens will be sold until Rich Token achieves a position within the Coinmarketcap Top 1000. This strategic approach prioritizes community success and long-term value.

Please do NOT buy all the tokens in the liquidity pool. The intent is to have as many investors as possible before increasing/starting new pools.

The ApeCoin Rewards App offers an exclusive platform for ApeCoin and BAYC holders to access unique discounts and offers both online and offline, enhancing the utility and value of ApeCoin.

Fully funded by the DAO, the app enables token holders to enjoy special offers such as:
* 2-for-1 tickets at concerts and festivals
* Substantial discounts from over 700 retailers both IRL and online.

Because this is funded by the DAO, 100% of revenues are directly passed back to token holders, increasing the attractiveness and loyalty within the ApeCoin ecosystem. The app also provides advantages to MADE BY APES licensees, offering them exposure within the platform at no cost, and assisting them in reaching their target audience and building their brands more effectively.

Available on iOS, Android, and as a web application, the ApeCoin Rewards App is designed to ensure easy accessibility and maximum utility for holders of one or more ApeCoin, BAYC and MAYC, Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Bulls On The Block and Surreal Guild assets, making it a pivotal tool in the promotion and growth of the ApeCoin ecosystem.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The ApeCoin Rewards App delivers substantial benefits:
1. Exclusive Access: Provides token-gated offers and discounts unavailable to the general public, enhancing the value of holding ApeCoin, BAYC, Mocaverse, JRNY Club and Surreal Guild holders.
2. Enhanced Engagement: Increases engagement and loyalty within the ApeCoin community by offering tangible rewards.
3. Economic Advantage: As the DAO funds the app, there are no commissions deducted by FanCircles, ensuring all savings and earnings are 100% passed back to the community.

##### OVERALL COST 
The total budget for the ApeCoin Rewards App is £480,000 (approximately $590,000) for two years (£288,000 for platform operation, and £192,000 for account management).

The funding term is 24 months; we may submit a follow-up AIP in the unlikely event that this project require further 
funding. The new 24 month period for funding, extended from 12 months, in the initial proposal, allows more extensive deals to be secured, especially concerts and festivals who have year long cycles, more time to be invested in growing the awareness amongst partners and holders alike, and a strong confidence level that retail and event partners to become comfortable that the ApeCoin Rewards App is not only protecting their brand values and publicly listed prices, but also brings incremental sales. This in turn allows us to recoup any future ongoing costs after the two year term, from advertising fees we can then charge partners to continue to reach the ApeCoin and BAYC community.

Funding will be due upon project passing.

Travala.com has published a proposal for the Venus community to integrate XVS as a payment option on their website. 

This partnership would provide significant benefits for the Venus community by expanding the utility of XVS in the real world through travel bookings. The marketing support and exposure provided by Travala, along with the convenience of booking with preferred cryptocurrencies, would further enhance the integration's appeal. 

Travala's established presence in the travel industry, with major partnerships and a Best Price Guarantee policy, offers a strong foundation for this collaboration. 

By leveraging Travala's platform, Venus can tap into a large user base that is already accustomed to using cryptocurrencies for travel bookings. The proposal's focus on boosting XVS's utility and accessibility aligns well with the strategic vision of both the Venus community and Travala. 

The initial support from Venus DAO to cover integration costs and marketing expenses demonstrates a commitment to driving the success of this partnership.",bearish

358,"# Summary

This proposal seeks to gather Balancer community support and approval for Solace DAO to launch and operate a new Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora chain, an EVM within the NEAR ecosystem. This newly deployed protocol will be called Holdr, with the governance token HLDR, and ultimately governed by Holdr DAO.

# Abstract

If approved, this proposal will result in:

- Solace DAO launching Holdr as an officially recognized Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora
- Balancer DAO Treasury receiving 4% of HLDR total supply
- BAL tokenholders receiving 1% of HLDR total supply
- Solace DAO and Balancer DAO research and co-marketing collaboration

# Preface

This proposal is shared by Solace’s team and was written by Nikita Buzov (founder). Solace has received a grant of $20,000-worth of AURORA tokens from Aurora to pursue this proposal and launch a Balancer V2 friendly fork. Also, back in summer 2021, Solace DAO has also received a NEAR grant worth of $30,000 from NEAR Foundation to develop Solace, a DeFi Insurance protocol (live across Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Aurora). Therefore, Solace has been well supported and integrated within the NEAR ecosystem community, which, along with successful experience operating DeFi protocols, makes Solace team a natural partner within the Aurora’s and NEAR’s ecosystems.

# Motivation

Both NEAR and Aurora ecosystems have been steadily growing and developing their unique technology. Over the years they have shown a strong commitment to innovation and user experience, developer community, as well as security! Because of this continued growth, Solace is excited to support their ecosystem and, together with Aurora, identified a need for Balancer V2 technology to become present there.

# Background

Solace is a DeFi insurance protocol, founded back in 2020 and first launched in 2021 on Ethereum, later expanding to Polygon, Fantom, and Aurora. Over the past years Solace team has been awarded grants from Polygon, Aave, NEAR, Celer, and Aurora, following successful completion of the specified goals. Additionally Solace DAO has been funded through a seed round in 2021 (raised $1.1M). The team has displayed over time a great track-record of shipping products, developing and setting up complex architectures, operating protocols on multiple chains. Solace’s team is currently composed of 10 people: 5 engineers, 1 UI/UX designer, 2 BD & marketing, 1 operations, 1 founder (also an engineer).

# Specification

Solace is set to launch Balancer V2 fork in the most current production deployment, including all the core technology. With security in mind, Solace will not make any changes or updates (unless explicitly requested by Balancer DAO, or an emergency response to a verified vulnerability is required) to the core smart contracts. This work has been complete and the contracts are live in production. I invite you to check and verify both the application and the deployed contracts following these links:

- Website (access the app through the link on there): https://holdr.fi/
- Smart contracts: [https://holdr.gitbook.io/holdr-protocol-overview/developers/deployment-addresses](https://holdr.gitbook.io/holdr-protocol-overview/developers/deployment-addresses)

Please note that LBP UI and the Bribe market functionality are still in development, but should be completed in the following weeks, ahead of the HLDR token launch (tentatively scheduled for December'22).

Holdr will also follow the exact same governance process and tokenomics design as veBAL, locking 80/20 HLDR/wNEAR BPT with a max period of 1 year to control the HLDR liquidity mining emissions across gauges.

# HLDR Supply and Distribution

The total supply of HLDR will be 100,000,000 HLDR tokens and distributed through the following allocations and schedules:

## 5% - Balancer

A portion of the Holdr protocol should be owned by both the Balancer’s treasury and BAL holders. This would be following a standard set by a previous Balancer friendly fork, Beethoven X. We propose, in a similar fashion, that 5% of the total supply of HLDR should be allocated as follows:

- 4% provided to the Balancer DAO Treasury (2y linear vesting, 6mo cliff).
- 1% provided as an airdrop to BAL holders as follows:
    - A backdated snapshot will be taken for all BAL holders
    - Only holders with a BAL value greater than $100 USD will be eligible
    - A 2x multiplier will be assigned to BAL and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders, including the holders of veBAL locking their BPTs, on Ethereum
    - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Arbitrum BAL and BAL/ETH 60/40 BPT holders
    - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Polygon BAL, USDC/MATIC/WETH/BAL 25/25/25/25 BPT, and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders.

To achieve a more equitable distribution of the airdrop tokens, they will be distributed based on the weights above, not based on the USD value of the holdings. Note, any qualifying address will need to have a Holdr LP position, worth at least $100, staked in incentivized liquidity mining. A snapshot date will be announced within a month after the launch, if this vote is passes. The distribution mechanism of the tokens will be defined collaboratively between the Solace team and the Balancer community and the requirements outlined here are subject to small revisions.

## 15% - Solace DAO

This allocation will be awarded across Solace DAO, Solace Launch DAO, and the active team members to compensate for the on-going work and to support Holdr protocol operations. The distribution will happen on a 2 year linear vesting schedule with a 6-month cliff.

## 15% - Holdr DAO Treasury

The Holdr DAO will be formed overtime by the community and will inherit this treasury to govern and financially support any future developments, grants, contributor compensations, etc. Solace team’s goal over the next couple of years will be to pass on the governance as the Holdr DAO matures. This treasury will be be vesting linearly for 5 years, with a 1-year cliff.

## 14.125% - Ecosystem Partners & Investors

This allocations will be utilized to effectively partner with various protocols within NEAR and Aurora ecosystems, as well as to raise some capital to finance any operational costs. Vesting will follow a linear schedule of 2 years, with a 6-month cliff, similar to the Balancer DAO and Solace DAO allocation.

## 2% - HLDR Liquidity Bootstrapping

These funds will be used to seed and launch HLDR token using Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool.

## 48.875% - Liquidity Mining Emissions

Similar to Balancer’s schedule, Holdr will adopt emissions halving every 4 years. The initial emissions rate will start at 150,000 HLDR/wk.

# Friendly Fork Agreement

If accepted by the Governance process of both DAOs, this friendly fork will start effective immediately. There is no expiry date to the agreement; however, both DAOs can override this Friendly Fork agreement through their governance process to remove the Friendly Fork title with a one-month notice period. If such decision passes a vote, Balancer DAO will loose claim to all unvested HLDR tokens granted to their DAO Treasury.",bullish

> Proposal to add gauge support for a newly created qETH/ETH pool on Ethereum.

**References/Useful links:**

**Protocol Description:**

>Tranchess is a yield-enhancing asset tracker launched on BNB Chain in June 2021. It launched its BNB liquid staking fund in January 2022 with its own validator node and is now one of the top protocols on the BNB Chain. 

>Tranchess’ fund structure comprises one main fund, known as the QUEEN token, and two tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. QUEEN tracks the underlying asset's price and earns enhanced yield with features such as yield farming and liquid staking. QUEEN can be split evenly into two sub-tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. BISHOP is a stablecoin-like token that earns a steady yield by lending its underlying position to ROOK. ROOK is a token with a built-in leveraged position to the underlying asset without the risk of forced liquidation.

>Tranchess currently runs three asset-tracking funds: BTC, ETH and BNB on the BNB Chain, and is launching its first ETH liquid staking fund on Ethereum on Nov. 25th. qETH is the liquid-staked ETH from the Tranchess Beacon chain staking system. For the convenience of future collaboration with other Ethereum protocols, qETH is designed so that the staking rewards of staked ETH is reflected as a change in the fair value of qETH, instead of a change in the number of qETH tokens. The qETH token amount would only change if users stake/unstake additional ETH with Tranchess. The proposed pool, qETH/ETH, allows users to swap between qETH and ETH, as redemption is currently not supported on the Ethereum Beacon chain. 

**Motivation:**

> The qETH/ETH pool is the cornerstone of the Tranchess ETH liquid staking product on Ethereum. Currently, the BNB liquid staking fund of Tranchess earns a total yield between 11.2%~27.9%, a combination of Tranchess staking earning of CHESS (Tranchess governance token) and PoS staking. With the ETH liquid staking fund, Tranchess aims to provide a similar enhanced yield for users on Ethereum, and the qETH/ETH pool is an essential feature to a smooth user experience.

>A veBAL gauge incentivizes users to participate and would help quickly build up the liquidity of the pool at the beginning stage for a smoother swapping experience. The pool would naturally grow with the protocol, and we expect to facilitate the incentivization with Hidden Hand and the Balancer bribing narrative.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Tranchess’ governance token is CHESS, which users earn by staking with Tranchess platform. CHESS holders can vote on various governance items, such as the staking earning split between BISHOP and ROOK, the weekly CHESS emission split among different funds, and can collect a weekly rebate of the protocol fees. CHESS holders also vote through Tranchess’s snapshot on proposals which are discussed and raised on the [TranchessForum](https://forum.tranchess.com/).   

2. **Oracles:** Tranchess adopts Chainlink as the price oracle.

3. **Audits:** Tranchess has done multiple audits since launching as we continuously develop and improve the protocol. The most recent audit report can be found [here](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-TranchessV2.1-v1.0.pdf). Additionally, Tranchess runs a [bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/tranchess/) with Immunefi.

4. **Centralization vectors:**
The token is not upgradeable or pausable.
The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract.
Tranchess ETH liquid staking is a decentralized ETH2 liquid staking product collectively runs by the Tranchess dev team and node operators.


5. **Market History:** Link to the pool: [0xC9C5Ff67bB2Fae526aE2467C359609D6BCb4c532](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC9C5Ff67bB2Fae526aE2467C359609D6BCb4c532)

6. **Value:** The qETH/ETH pool would be the primary source of liquidity for Tranchess ETH liquid staking fund, a first stop that all Tranchess users would visit when staking with Tranchess. The pool organically grows with Tranchess ETH liquid staking volume, contributing to the Balancer community.

The adjustments i suggest are that: 

. - All ranks get an equal weight pay out. (13.3% of cake goes to each rank)
- Cake only gets burned when it flows in to the lottery.
-Cake stays in its rank till it's won, no redistribution if rank 5 or 6 did not got won.


Point 1 will have the result that if you buy 10 tickets and win in the first rank you will get around 80% of your cake back.

Point 2 and 3 will result in prizepools that are worth to be won and worth to take the risk to play the lottery. More people who want to play should result in more cake being burned.

In case i'm wrong and after 3 weeks or so you see a reduction in cake being burned you could raise the burn upon entry to 30 or 40% from the current 20.",bullish

370,"Title: [ARFC] Aave Events & Sponsorship Budget
Author: @AaveCompanies
Date: 2023-10-15

# Summary
This ARFC proposes the Aave DAO budget allocation on events at DevConnect, rAAVE, and ETHGlobal Istanbul that will drive awareness and attract new participants to the Aave’s Protocol, GHO, and Aave ecosystem. Thank you for reviewing this proposal and for your earlier questions and positive vote in the snapshot.

# Motivation
Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users and stakeholders.

Although the Aave Protocol has achieved success and recognition in DeFi, it’s important to retain strong community support and engagement as well as to continue to reach out to new people. We are proposing several thoughtful, well-organized and targeted events at DevConnect, including hackathons, booth presence, rAAVE and smaller side events that bring the broader community together. Community-building and reinforcing brand values and building recognition are essential to retaining and growing the participation of web3 users.

# Overview
Aave Companies is requesting a budget allocation of $550,000 for the remainder of the year paid in GHO to support a range of targeted activations and events to continue growing and nurturing the global Aave Community. These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:
1. Hackathons: Aave Companies intends to sponsor hackathons to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol and stablecoin GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, but they also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem.
2. Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences allows the Aave community to efficiently increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge as well as industry insights. These events often include panels, workshops and discussions led by industry experts. Side events are also where Aave demonstrates our commitment to web3 ecosystem inclusivity and diversity by tapping into new communities and audiences. We’re proud to be supporters of groups such as SheFi and BoysClub.
3. Merch: Aave Companies recognizes the importance of high-quality, sustainably produced merchandise in building brand recognition and loyalty. We intend to continue producing highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events as part of community engagement efforts and to proliferate the ghost. We will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials, while creating merch that people actually wear, use and love. Finding appropriate partners is always extremely hard and we are proud that our team has been able to find good, cost-effective solutions. We don’t expose the cost per piece, however, we are very mindful of costs here and in all expenditures, making sure to receive bids and assess each partner individually for cost, quality, execution and sustainability.
4. Development of the GHO Pass: With one of the core missions of the Aave community being to grow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity, we’re excited to announce Aave Companies’ development of the GHO Pass. The GHO Pass V1 will facilitate GHO purchases at both Aave events and sponsored events. We plan to launch GHO Pass at DevConnect, where users can get early access to select rAAVE tickets and drink credits, exclusive merch and other perks. This initiative will support GHO adoption and ensure that the Aave community and others unfamiliar with GHO, will experience the power of GHO as a payment layer at DevConnect and outside this event in the future. We plan for any proceeds from the GHO pass to go back directly into the budget for future activities that support the protocol and GHO. This is for accounting simplicity reasons.
5. rAAVE: To celebrate, give back to the Aave community and attract new users, we plan for Aave DAO to host another edition of the vibrant and highly anticipated rAAVE event. This event serves as an excellent opportunity to create a memorable experience for the Aave community and spread Aave culture. We will also explore live streaming rAAVE, and integrating GHO pass (as mentioned above). As organisers, we will manage the ticketing logistics. We will also manage press relations social and other related Aave communications at no extra direct costs to the DAO. We want to keep the fine details of how the event is orchestrated and related detailed cost break down confidential both for flexibility and competitive reasons. The cost structure is a blueprint to how the event, which is unparalleled in the industry, is successfully executed. It is important that rAAVEs are available for Aave community members and we will find a way to provide a window of opportunity to claim a ticket. Tickets are available via multiple avenues tied to different activities and timing, and we conduct outreach to various organizations to target different audiences and demographics to enhance diversity and attract strategic partners and developers.

# Activations
Activations continue to be a key focus and driver of growth for the Aave ecosystem thanks to:
- Creating a welcoming, engaging,memorable and Aave branded experience at the Aave booth.
- Sponsoring side events, hackathons, prizes and providing exceptional support to developers.
- Spreading Aave’s culture by distributing highly coveted merchandise.
- Selectively hosting rAAVEs to bring the Aave community together, reward contributors and make Aave the top ecosystem in crypto.
- Developing GHO Pass payment portal to showcase the power and utility of GHO.

| Name  |  Date  | Details |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ETH Global Istanbul  | Nov 17-19  | During the week of Devconnect. ETHGlobal puts on arguably the most reputable hackathon events in the Ethereum ecosystem. Istanbul is a community with substantial and growing crypto adoption and is a prime market to engage hackers and the community with Aave and GHO.  |
| rAAVE  | Nov TBD  | rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem. We will host one rAAVE during the course of this proposal that is powered by GHO to help spread adoption and awareness.  |
| Devconnect + Side Events  | Nov 13-19  | Devconnect is the event of the year in the Ethereum community. Hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, it is expected to be the most attended web3 event of 2023. Activating here allows us to efficiently reach a wide audience of developers and others in the broader ecosystem and connect with many from our community. The total allocation request for DevConnect covers several side events that are selected carefully to maximize impact. The booth experience and design is in line with previous spending and the Aave booth consistently outperforms, attracting a significant number of developers, community members and people who are unfamiliar to the Protocol.  |
| Side Events	  | Q4  | Side events selection is based on strengthening Aave’s and GHO’s presence within various strategic audiences, outreaching to new target audiences, ensuring Aave remains top-of-mind within and outside the community, and gaining awareness of GHO. Side events we’re currently considering include: SheFi Summit Istanbul, Certora at DevConnect, Scroll Day, notDevcon by ITU Blockchain, StableSummit Istanbul. Funds from any side events that are not confirmed will be rolled over and held in the marketing budget for potential other side events of import here or at other events in the future.  |

For this proposal, Aave Companies is focusing on sponsoring fewer events, while increasing the quality and impact of Aave’s presence.

A majority of the new event spend will be used to have an impactful presence during Devconnect, ETHGlobal Istanbul, and rAAVE to drive hackers to build with GHO and to increase GHO utilization within the wider community. Since Devconnect week will be the marquee event of the year, any remaining budget after the main sponsorships will be allocated to side events related to DeFi or Smart Contract Security.

We have a robust tracking system for all Aave DAO-related expenditures. We are very careful to sequester funds and have strong internal ethical guidelines and accounting procedures that are followed to ensure funds are used appropriately. Aave Companies will ensure that the budget from this proposal will be used only for specific, community approved, Aave-related endeavors and that any excess budget is rolled back into the events marketing budget that supports Aave and GHO outreach.

# Next Steps
- If Snapshot is successful, then move to AIP

# Conclusion
Aave Companies is deeply committed to the Aave community. We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of $550,000 paid in GHO for activations and events for the remainder of 2023 will not only enrich the Aave ecosystem but also foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition. We look forward to the DAO’s support in enabling these important initiatives to come to life and continue to drive the growth of the Aave ecosystem. We will rollover any excess allocation to Q1 2024 events.",neutral

# Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:

Balancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.

This proposal deals with the Product Development element housed in the OpCo. The initial discussion is at [draft BIP for year 2 funding](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-year-two/4882) and the comments there related to Product should be considered as a part of this proposal. This proposal has been adapted to incorporate feedback from that forum discussion and includes more details around the evolution from Front-end and Design to a more holistic Product model. In particular, a Product Vision section has been added and the Goals section has been updated to align our work more closely with protocol objectives. The proposal period has been reduced from 12 months to 9 months, and the budget has been tightened.

For reference, the Administrative and Operations element of OpCo is dealt with in a separate proposal [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-for-year-2-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q2/4923).

The revised proposal for Product seeks approval for 723,525 USDC, compared with 1,139,544 USDC for the previous version. The table below shows the bridge between the previous proposal budget and the revised proposal. Reducing the period to 9 months cut the forecast by 316k USDC down to 824k USDC. This also reduces the BAL request from 38,020.83 BAL to 28,958.33 BAL. We have further trimmed the proposal by 100k USDC to a final figure of 724k USDC.

 
![bip351-1.png](ipfs://bafkreihnvwwaoop35udm3bqga4nnd6vir45n4kfwcymhnwe5t7bw3mxmri)
    

The $100k reduction for the 9-month period comprises:

* Dropping the FX buffer for non-USD payroll from 5% to 3%. Note that I have updated the FX rates from the mid buy/sell on xe.com to the rate used by the payroll provider in June, which moves against us slightly.
* Cutting the allowance for unconfirmed increases in January of up to 5% down to 0%.
* Cutting the payroll buffer for variances from 10% to 1%, which includes cutting staff allowances for phone, internet, co-working, and hardware to zero.
* Cutting the budget for TRM API calls of $20k to $0. The team is working on a lower-cost in-house solution to be implemented ASAP.

# Product Development Workstream

This section has been removed from snapshot to adhere to the max. Character limit. Read about the full details on the forum.

# Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):

Yes.

# Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:

Yes.

# Length of Engagement & Budget:

Nine months - July 2023 (Q3 FY23) through March 2024 (Q1 FY24) divided into three quarters.

The summary below reflects the proposed budget for these three quarters. Each quarter an update will be provided via Community Hall calls and Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be available to the DAO, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal.

We note that the Product team are employees/contractors under OpCo. Should DAO Governance vote to restructure the Product team, for example, change who maintains the front-end or for OpCo to cease hosting the front-end, OpCo policy is to provide staff severance equal to the requirements of local labour law in their jurisdiction, subject to a minimum of one month’s notice.

The table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.

### Requests for USDC:

The OpCo holds funds saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and Orb vs their original budgets in year 1. Estimated savings at the OpCo in year one have been partially allocated to fund the [Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) for Q3 FY23. The final savings figure will be known in Q3 FY23. We propose that USDC funding needs for Product be drawn from these funds, which are estimated to cover the nine months of the Product proposal.

Q3 FY23 - USDC 240,744 - cover with funds held at OpCo

Q4 FY23 - USDC 241,975 - cover with funds held at OpCo

Q1 FY24 - USDC 240,775 - cover with funds held at OpCo

### Request for BAL transfer:

Q3 FY23 - 28,958.33 BAL - for transfer after the snapshot vote, if successful.

### Impact on the Treasury

The projected spend associated with this proposal can be covered by projected savings at OpCo and Orb from year 1, since we now have more recent data on those projections. Thus OpCo does not require any funding from the DAO Treasury to fund this proposal.

For objective comparison, the Treasury currently holds [~4.5M in USDC](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/year-2-sp-funding-impact-analysis/4921). OpCo holds ~1.4M in unallocated USDC (resulting from the savings mentioned), together ~5.9M in USDC. Funding this proposal for the year would cost around 12.3% of combined current unallocated funds at OpCo, and current DAO Treasury USDC (not including the impact of projected revenue during the period).

### People Costs - Product

People Costs are comprised of remuneration and employment costs for the developers. Remuneration is currently denominated in USD, AUD, GBP, and EUR. Exchange rate fluctuations against the US Dollar will impact the actual results. We have built a 3% buffer on FX rates.

There is also a buffer to cover small unexpected variances in employment costs. As mentioned, this has been cut from 10% to 1%, which includes cutting staff allowances for phone, internet, co-working and hardware to zero. Any unused amounts will either be rolled into the next funding proposal or returned to the DAO.

In addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting 28,958.33 BAL for the nine-month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. These BAL would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.

Should any of these employees leave before the completion of the 4-year vesting period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff, or return to the DAO Treasury.

### Non-People Costs - Product

Non-People Costs Product consists of software subscriptions to front-end development tools and TRM. These costs have reduced significantly from year one. New additions to the cost structure relate to the design element, proposed to be housed in OpCo from 1 August 2023.

Alchemy is the largest line item at $2,945 per month or $35,340 for the period. The TRM annual subscription runs until May 2024. The annual renewal (est $30k) is outside the period of this proposal and is therefore excluded. In addition, the team is cutting the budget for TRM API calls from $20k to $0. The team is working on a lower-cost in-house solution to be implemented ASAP.

These and the other software costs depend on certain variables, including, for example, the number of users, log-ins, number of entities in the community that have access, and service calls. Some are billed monthly and others quarterly or annually, hence the changes in costs from one quarter to the next. We have estimated these figures using the best information available as of now, and recognise there will likely be variances during the year as more accurate data becomes available and actual costs become known. The team continues to monitor the usage of these services in order to reduce fees, and where possible negotiate more favourable rates - noting that material negotiations were undertaken in year one that we continue to reap the benefits of.

**Title:** [ARFC] Stablecoin Harmonization and Asset Parameters Optimization 
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-01-03

---
## Simple Summary

This ARFC proposes focusing stablecoin collateral usage on USDT and USDC while setting LTV to zero for less-trafficked stablecoins and long-tail assets. The objective is to minimize risk for the protocol, optimize revenue generation, and align with market demand trends.

## Motivation

Aave's revenue primarily comes from wETH borrowing and stablecoins borrowing. Years of User behavior data in DeFi indicates a low demand for fluctuating assets as collateral except in use-case-specific scenarios (LST/LRT loops for Weth, RPL borrow to deploy mini pools). Based on @ChaosLabs  [data](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Ethereum/listed-assets/), only 2.4%, 3.7%, and 5.8% of supplied DAI, USDT, and USDC on Ethereum are being utilized as collateral. We can also note that market demand for alternative stablecoins is less sensitive to borrow rates compared to blue-chip stablecoins like USDT and USDC.


The DAO governance has been lenient in onboarding some collaterals, such as KNC, which currently attracts nearly zero traction (currently used to generate 0.79$ of borrow volume) and generates minimal revenue. Additionally, the asymmetric risk presented by stablecoins, such as during the CRV event (collateral was USDC with very high LT and low LB), highlights the need for optimization considering Risk/reward.

## Specification

### Proposed Adjustments:

The ACI proposes the following strategy shift:

1. Focus on USDT and USDC as primary stablecoin collaterals.
2. Set LTV to zero for alternative stablecoins and long tail assets.
3. Enable a 3%/week LT reduction for these stablecoins assets, providing ample time for users to react and keep them as passive yield sources or borrowable assets that represent 99% of current user demand and most of protocol revenue.
4. Propose the following adjusted standardized ReserveFactor categories for Aave assets:

| Collateral Type | Reserve Factor % |
| --- | --- |
| wETH | 15% |
| USDC/USDT | 10% |
| Alternative stablecoins & long tail assets | 20% |
| DAI | 25% |

5. Fade out as collateral the following stablecoins: 

- FRAX
- LUSD
- EURS
- agEUR
- JEUR
- MAI

6. freeze (if not already), then slowly offboard the following alternative stablecoins and long-tail assets that failed to gain traction by gradually increasing RF to 99.9%, decreasing LT by 3% per week then applying incremental interestRateStrategies incentivizing users to switch to others collaterals or borrowed asset as the DAO implemented for BUSD and TUSD on Aave V2:

| Collateral Type          | Network      |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| EURS                    | All pools     |
| agEUR                   | All pools     |
| JEUR                    | All pools     |
| MAI                      | All pools    |
| KNC                     | Ethereum     |
| STG                     | Ethereum     |
| BAL                     | All pools    |
| FXS                     | Ethereum     |
| UNI                     | Ethereum     |
| WBTC.e                  | Avalanche      |


## Next Steps

1. Community feedback and gather consensus on the proposed adjustments.
2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.
3. If successful, escalate to AIP stage.

### Motivation

Balancer contributors have recently been exploring ways to increase non-toxic flow through the protocol. In the wake of BIP-295’s approval discussions have been in progress with 1inch to bring this discount to 1inch Fusion. This would be done by granting the role for calling `setSwapFeePercentage` to the 1inch Labs settlement contract - then they would pass in interactions which lower the fee on the pool, execute the swap, then return the fee to the previous value. The swap fee could be lowered in this manner by up to 80% to enable a significant increase in “good flow” to Balancer pools.

Since Fusion is also available on L2’s we can extend this discount to Arbitrum and Polygon as well.

Most of Balancer’s protocol fees are generated from yield rather than swaps. There is a chance this proposal leads to more swap fees but even if it does not, one of the most important goals for the Balancer ecosystem is to grow our DEX volume market share. This is likely one of the best chances we have to move the needle on that.

### Risks

The Maxis will retain the ability to call `setSwapFeePercentage` on all pool factories so if something unexpected happens and fees are dramatically lowered or raised globally by accident it can be fixed very quickly by the Maxis. Governance can also revoke this role at any time in the future through a future BIP.

375,"Curve Finance is proposing to start utilising the community fund for ecosystem, DAO and community grants. Those three type of grants have the common goal of encouraging and developing the Curve ecosystem and empowering the community.

We are proposing to trial those grants for four months and this proposal seeks to approve the council as well as the budget for it. A new vote four months from now will give a chance to the council to demonstrate results and the DAO to reconsider the budget and/or put an end to those grants.

After discussions with other DeFi protocols, we strongly believe those grants have the potential to have long last benefit for Curve and its ecosystem.

376,"# Summary
1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.

# Motivations
Launched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):

Total trading volume: $160B
Total swaps: 5.91M
Total users: 1.25M

1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.

The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.

In December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.

# Benefits to Aave Community

1INCH is highly liquid.
1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.
1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.
1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.

# Specification
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
RoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3

3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.

1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.

1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.

On the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

The 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.

1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.

1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.

P2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.
1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.

Supported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.

# How is the asset currently used?

1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3

#Emission schedule

The 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.

Of the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).

Uncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).

# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability

The smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.

The 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.

## General

The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.

* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.
* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.
* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.
  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.
  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.
  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.

The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.

## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:

The 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M

The 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.

The 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.

On April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.

### Motivation

As part of the ongoing process to transition to the timelock authorizer the Maxis have temporarily lost the ability to add gauges the traditional way. Once the migration to the new authorizer and to the Gauge Adder v3 is complete then that ability will be restored. We're currently targeting the end of February for this to be done. Until then, any new gauge must be added by the DAO Multisig directly. BIP 159 & 160 were not written with the specification required to do this. After communicating with the teams involved they desire to proceed immediately with the adding of their gauges rather than waiting another month. This proposal will add their already approved gauges directly from the DAO Multisig.

**It's also important to note that once we trigger the next stage of the Gauge Adder v3 migration there will be a 14 day window where no new gauges can be added by any method. This is expected to begin on Feb 13th or so.**

Protocol Description:

rsETH is one of the largest LST-based liquid restaked token on the EigenLayer ecosystem. It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs

Kelp has more than 260,000 ETH worth of assets restaked by over 40,000 users across multiple L2s. All of this is within 4 months of launch

By providing liquidity for the restaked positions, wrsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.

Motivation:

Kelp is seeking to establish the [wrsETH/ETH on Optimism] and on Balancer to further enrich the liquidity of wrsETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Kelp community.

Specifications:

1. Governance: Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon

2. Oracles: Kelp is working with Redstone to create price feeds of rsETH.

3. Audits: Kelp’s smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena.

4. Centralization vectors: Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.

Our goal is to migrate Kelp away from these vectors.

5. Market History: Kelp has seen meteoric growth in TVL in the last few weeks with TVL over 260k ETH and >40,000 holders of rsETH across mainnet and L2s.

Overview        

PancakeSwap has updated its platform to the veCAKE design with gauges voting, expanding opportunities for the DeFi ecosystem. Cakepie is developing a Meta-Governance layer on top of PancakeSwap, focusing on accumulating veCAKE to leverage its voting power and yield boosting advantages. These benefits are then efficiently provided to users through our platform as currently, Cakepie holds over 37% of the total veCAKE from PancakeSwap.

With veCAKE, Cakepie gets:

- Governance Rights on PancakeSwap: Can vote on decision making

- Gauge Voting Power: Can use our veCAKE to distribute CAKE emissions across PancakeSwap liquidity pools (More votes for pools = more cake emissions to its LPs)

- Yield Boosting benefits: Thanks to our veCAKE, we allow liquidity providers to get their CAKE yields boosted without having to lock CAKE as veCAKE by themselves.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/Cakepiexyz_io

Proposal

Cakepie has accumulated over 6.8 million CAKE tokens as veCAKE, establishing itself as the top holder in DeFi. This accumulation of veCAKE grants Cakepie significant voting power in the PancakeSwap Voting Gauge. By controlling over 37% of the total veCAKE, Cakepie holds considerable influence over the distribution of CAKE tokens to PancakeSwap liquidity providers. As Venus hosts its XVS liquidity on PCS, we anticipate a collaborative effort where our users will vote for your XVS-BNB pool, directing CAKE emissions toward it in exchange for incentives. This can lead to a cost-effective approach for incentivizing XVS liquidity providers on PancakeSwap while maximizing their rewards.

Motivation:

Cakepie is committed to offering enhanced CAKE rewards within the PancakeSwap Ecosystem. As a leading platform in DeFi by TVL, we anticipate building a lasting relationship with Venus. Our objective is to amplify user involvement and community interaction by providing increased passive income to XVS-BNB liquidity providers, thus aiding Venus’s development and further expansion in the decentralized finance sector.

Specification:

- The Venus Treasury would offer incentives to vlCKP voters through the Cakepie bribery market to secure their voting support.

- We suggest that Venus offer $2,000 as a bribe per epoch, for four epochs (amounting to $8k), with the potential to increase the amount and extend the duration of the incentive offerings upon achieving a good bribe efficiency.

- Each epoch lasts two weeks, so the total investment by Venus would be $8,000 with the goal of gaining more value in CAKE emissions and optimising liquidity for the XVS-BNB pair. This could in turn possibly allow Venus to support bigger XVS Supply Cap limits on its core pool. We aim to achieve a bribe efficiency higher than 2:1, meaning Venus would receive over $16,000 worth of CAKE during four epochs while offering $8,000 in incentives to vlCKP voters via the Cakepie bribery market.

- VICKP holders from Cakepie will vote for the XVS-BNB PancakeSwap V3 pair in exchange for incentives.

- More CAKE emissions will be directed towards the XVS-BNB V3 pair in proportion to the number of vlCKP votes it receives through the Cakepie bribery market.",neutral
383,"#### ABSTRACT

Cartan Group LLC (""Cartan "" or “we”), trusted and invited by the launch contributors, was elected by the community to administer the governance process for Ape Improvement Proposals (""AIPs ”) and the voting process, as outlined in AIP-1 and AIP-2, respectively.

Over the past 8 months, we’ve had the opportunity to serve the community and push forward the DAO’s long-term vision. We have talked to thousands of community members, made new friends, and have had an amazing time collaborating with everyone *(more on Cartan’s initial scope of DAO operations and key accomplishments to date in Rationale Section below)*.

We have worked continuously to match the momentum and keep the workflow moving, which meant taking on additional responsibilities that were not part of the original scope. Ultimately, things needed to be done, so we rolled up our sleeves and delivered, and through operating this way, and listening to the community, we have connected with the nuances of what community members want delivered *(more on expansion of scope of DAO operations and key accomplishments to date in Rationale Section below)*.

#### OVERALL COST

The community approved fees for the Initial Scope of DAO Operations were US$150,000 per month.

In order to address the Expanded Scope of DAO Operations, the monthly costs for this AIP is US$250,000 + 20,000 ApeCoin.

The reason for the split cost (between US$ and ApeCoin) is that we know it is important that we fully align with the community and commit to growing the ApeCoin ecosystem, thereby increasing demand, which is beneficial to all.

385,"### Introduction

The Balancer gauge space has become quite cluttered.  This BIP proposes to remove a number of gauges that have been around for a while but are not receiving any votes.   The purpose of this governance is not to remove a gauge that is in use by a DAO, but simply to clean up gauges that seem to be abandoned.  Any DAO managing one of the tokens in the gauges listed below is welcome to request it is removed from the list of gauges to be removed so long as there is a clear plan to either obtain vote weight to trigger emissions from it or promote significant volume in the near future. 

### Specification

This BIP recommends the the removal of gauges for the following pools, all of which have received 0 or very minimal voting in recent rounds, and also are not generating significant activity in the form of trading volume or fees. Note the accompanying gauge address for each pool.

386,"## Summary

This Snapshot is designed to formalize the community’s consensus regarding the deployment of the GHO Stability Module (GSM) and its initial parameters.

## **Voting Options**

Given the current discussions regarding the effectiveness of the GHO Stability Module (GSM), we present two options via Snapshot to define the initial parameters. In these options, USDT and USDC are considered as underlying assets.

- Option A advocates for deploying the GSM, but with swap functionality paused. This implies that the module will remain inactive until the DAO decides to reactivate it. Such reactivation may involve parameter adjustments depending on market conditions. This option establishes the foundation for future GSM utilization, providing a straightforward setup without the need for complex deployments—just a simple AIP.

GSM USDC

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Underlying Price Range for Swap Freeze | Disabled |
| Underlying Price Range for Swap Unfreeze | Disabled |
| Buy Fee | 0.2% |
| Sell Fee | 0.2% |
| Exposure Cap | 500,000 USDC |
| Facilitator Bucket Capacity | 500,000 GHO |
| Swap Active | False |

GSM USDT

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Underlying Price Range for Swap Freeze | Disabled |
| Underlying Price Range for Swap Unfreeze | Disabled |

| Sell Fee | 0.2% |
| Exposure Cap | 500,000 USDT |
| Facilitator Bucket Capacity | 500,000 GHO |
| Swap Active | False |
- Option B, considering the existing conditions with GHO at around $0.983, proposes specific parameters for immediate deployment with the swap functionality already activated. This signifies that the GSM will be enabled and ready for use upon deployment.

GSM USDC

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Underlying Price Range for Swap Freeze | [0.99 - 1.01] |
| Underlying Price Range for Swap Unfreeze | [0.995 - 1.005] |
| Buy Fee | 0.2% |
| Sell Fee | 0.2% |
| Exposure Cap | 500,000 USDC |
| Facilitator Bucket Capacity | 500,000 GHO |
| Swap Active | True |

| Exposure Cap | 500,000 USDT |
| Facilitator Bucket Capacity | 500,000 GHO |

389,"Following [AIP-26](https://app.aave.com/governance/23-QmVXVtoDGzNtAPDCTWg7vYaezadKwsuHLrbgaTDRESQKzB) it was noticed that the interest accrued for the AMPL market above 75% utilization is higher than expected. After investigation the reason for the discrepancy was identified to be the following:

In AAVEs MathUtils there is an over-approximation in the application of the interest rate for computing compounded interest.
### In [calculateCompoundedInterest](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/baeb455fad42d3160d571bd8d3a795948b72dd85/contracts/protocol/libraries/math/MathUtils.sol#L45) method

The deviation in the applied interest rate causes a small over-approximation for APYs <10%, but grows exponentially as can be seen below.

|Expected APY|Effective APY|Expected daily rate|Effective daily rate|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|4.00%|4.08%|0.01%|0.01%|
|5.00%|5.13%|0.01%|0.01%|

|10000.00%|2.69E+43%|1.30%|31.52%|

This difference is especially noticeable in the AMPL market, where the configured interest rate can go up to 10,002% at max utilization.

The AAVE Genesis team has been made aware and they will publish more guidance on the discrepancy.

This snapshot vote proposes two different curve configurations to adjust for the over-approximation:

### Curve #1 Rationale

As mentioned in [AIP-26](https://app.aave.com/governance/23-QmVXVtoDGzNtAPDCTWg7vYaezadKwsuHLrbgaTDRESQKzB), a nonlinear interest curve is more suited for AMPL's market and potentially other assets on AAVE's platform. It turns out that this over-approximation produces just such a curve.

The over-approximation mentioned above results in an exponentially growing curve which allows for defining a more suitable interest curve for AMPL. We propose the following parameters for [AAVE's default interest rate strategy](https://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/borrow-interest-rate#interest-rate-model), which produce the curve below:

|Optimal Utilization|Base rate|Slope1|Slope2|Maximum Effective APY|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|80|1.00%|2.00%|750.00%|186210.38%|

![|624x384](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7staH4CS61NIpT6hxRXfLlfmFcauxW7HfHfSInpkNCeUJ0XxH6poVjxXHior6yo7sTS86giXjf6568znRYsHlEe9Hch99XymIlEW8kpOKCNjhuwCxzoguNfePvybiH815j0AIrtD ""Chart"")

#### APY table above 80% Utilization:

|Utilization|APY|
|---|---|
|80.00%|3.05%|
|81.00%|49.93%|
|82.00%|118.15%|
|83.00%|217.40%|
|84.00%|361.82%|
|85.00%|571.94%|
|86.00%|877.67%|
|87.00%|1322.50%|
|88.00%|1969.72%|
|89.00%|2911.43%|
|90.00%|4281.60%|
|91.00%|6275.19%|
|92.00%|9175.85%|
|93.00%|13396.29%|
|94.00%|19536.98%|
|95.00%|28471.63%|
|96.00%|41471.48%|
|97.00%|60386.14%|
|98.00%|87906.81%|
|99.00%|127949.14%|
|100.00%|186210.38%|

#### Rationale:

1. Accounting for the over-approximation of the existing Slope2=10,000% interest curve requires reducing the slope2 parameter.
2. Taking advantage of the exponential curve allows for:
           a. Setting a higher optimal utilization rate.
           b. Setting a higher maximum APY to reduce the potential for 
                utilization being at 100% for extended periods.
    without creating a too steep of an interest rate increase right above the optimal utilization rate.

### Curve #2 Rationale:

1. Accounting for the over-approximation of the existing Slope2=10,000% interest curve requires reducing slope2 parameter. 
2. Adjust curve parameters to have maximum APY similar to the intended APY in [AIP-26](https://app.aave.com/governance/23-QmVXVtoDGzNtAPDCTWg7vYaezadKwsuHLrbgaTDRESQKzB) This causes this curve to have higher likelihood for periods at 100% utilization compared to curve #1.

391,"Current parameters:
Supply cap: `500k sAVAX` → `1m sAVAX` (proposed increase of supply cap)
Borrow cap: 0 sAVAX
DEX Liquidity: ~$40m

Normal mode:
LTV: 20%
Liquidation threshold: 30%
Liquidation penalty: 10%

E-mode:
Asset: AVAX
Max LTV: 92.5%

**Proposal: Increase of supply cap by 100% to 1m sAVAX (~$23m)**

The current sAVAX supply cap on v3 is 500k sAVAX (~ $11.5m) and has been reached within two weeks of listing.
Due to the efficacy of E-mode, where sAVAX can only be used as collateral to borrow AVAX, protocols built on top of aAVAsAVAX (AAVE Avalanche sAVAX) have seen extensive growth with deposits at max supply cap.
The proposal’s goal is to suggest an increase of 100% to 1m sAVAX supply cap via the fast-track process as outlined here (https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-v3-supply-borrow-cap-management-fast-track-process/8045).

Reasons for increase:

**DEX Liquidity and Conversion Rate**: Despite market conditions, DEX liquidity has remained around $40m across Platypus, TraderJoe and Pangolin. This can facilitate healthy liquidations if ever necessary. However, at the time of writing, there has not been any necessary liquidations of sAVAX on AAVE.

As Liquid Staked AVAX, there exists a pseudo peg to AVAX on secondary markets such as Platypus. Due to the nature of the asset, the conversion rate of sAVAX:AVAX has been quite closely maintained due to natural price arbitrage and a 15-days redemption window.

**LTV and E-mode**: sAVAX has a modest LTV on normal mode, at 20%, where there exists a healthy spread of price deviation to facilitate liquidations if necessary. On E-mode, only AVAX can be borrowed against sAVAX, which is a highly correlated asset with healthy liquidity on DEXs.

**Maturing Asset**: The cap was initially set as it was a deployment of a new pool. sAVAX has been listed for more than 2 weeks (listed 30th June 2022) and has been near supply cap since. As an asset, sAVAX is relatively mature, having launched in February 2022 and having undergone tumultuous market conditions and stress testing.

At its peak, there were over 4.27m AVAX staked within the BENQI protocol, with users claiming over 2.05m AVAX (> 46%) from the protocol on multiple occasions within days as documented by DefiLlama (https://defillama.com/protocol/benqi-staked-avax?denomination=AVAX).

Para aquellos que hayan mantenido Cake en sus wallets o en protocolos de BNB Chain por más de dos años, ofreceremos un reparto de utilidades al 3%. 

Este casino funcionaría 24/7 y ofrecería juegos de azar como loterías, máquinas tragamonedas y otros juegos populares como Black Jack y Ruleta. Los usuarios podrían apostar con una variedad de criptomonedas, incluyendo Cake, BNB, ETH, BTC, FIAT y PAX Gold.

Tendremos eventos especiales con botes acumulados (JACKPOT) para aumentar la emoción y las posibilidades de ganar para nuestros usuarios.

Para promocionar nuestro casino y atraer a nuevos usuarios, implementaremos una estrategia de marketing bien diseñada. Esto incluirá la creación de contenido atractivo en las redes sociales, la organización de eventos y promociones especiales, y la colaboración con influencers y otros líderes de opinión en la comunidad de criptomonedas.

Al combinar estas iniciativas con una plataforma de casino emocionante y atractiva, podemos atraer a una amplia base de usuarios y hacer crecer nuestro proyecto de manera sostenible. Al mismo tiempo, incentivamos la inversión a largo plazo y aumentamos el valor de Cake. Con estas medidas, podemos establecernos como una opción confiable y entretenida en el mundo de las criptomonedas.",neutral

403,"**I Would like to propose we update the after burner fuction on the locked CAKE staking pool. **

Currently, when someone's CAKE lock expires they have 7 days to withdraw or re-lock their CAKE and earned rewards. After 7 days the after burner starts and this will burn their rewards slowly over a few months until they hit 0 CAKE earned. 

I would like to propose we add a bounty system so other members of the pancake community can check what stakes have expired and have started burning and claim a bounty for moving these CAKE to the flexi pool. 

Once a expired locked CAKE position starts burning the community members will have the option pay the bnb transaction fee to move these CAKE from the locked pool to the flexi pool,  claim a bounty thats equal to 10% of the earned CAKE rewards and send 10% of the earned CAKE rewards to the burn. First to claim the reward gets it. 

To claim this bounty the community member should have 10,000 vCAKE. 

The after burner should not start after 7 days. This time frame should be changed so the amount of time is equal to the amount of time the coins where locked.  so if you lock for 7 months the after burner kicks in 7 months after your lock expires.  

****
Outcome for forgetful stakers = They get their investment back + 80% of earned CAKE rewards,and all their CAKE is staked in the flexi pool earning more CAKE rewards

Outcome for the community member = They pay a transaction fee and get 10% of the earned CAKE rewards

Outcome for the the protocol = 10% of the earned CAKE reward is burned",bearish

Title: [ARFC] Framework for ARFC and TEMP CHECK Proposals
Author: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative
Date: 2023-06-27
---

## Summary

This framework provides comprehensive guidelines for the Aave DAO community when creating and voting on ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) and TEMP CHECK proposals. It includes a template for crafting proposals and outlines the quorum and voting requirements.

## Motivation

### Distinction Between TEMP CHECK and ARFC

TEMP CHECKs serve as ""temperature checks"" to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.

Conversely, ARFCs are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.

### Proposal Template

Each proposal **must** include the following sections:

A header:
1. **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for the proposal, including the proposal type (ARFC or TEMP CHECK) in a [TAG] format.
2. **Author**: The name of the author and/or entity creating the proposal.
3. **Date**: The date the proposal is being made, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

A proposal body:

1. **Summary**: A succinct summary of the proposal.
2. **Motivation**: A detailed presentation of the proposal and potential benefits for the Aave protocol. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
3. **Specification**: A comprehensive description of the proposed change, including any relevant parameters or risk considerations. For ARFCs, this section should be technical, detailing the specific changes to be made. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
4. **Disclaimer**: Any necessary disclaimers, such as conflicts of interest or third-party involvement.
5. **Next Steps**: The proposed next steps if the proposal is approved.
6. **Copyright**: A statement defining proposal copyright. While Open-Source is **mandatory**, the choice of a specific license is left to the author.

### Voting Guidelines

1. **Vote Start Time**: The vote should commence 24 hours after the proposal is published on Snapshot.
2. **Proposal Age**: The governance thread related to the snapshot vote should be at least 5 days old before voting begins.
3. **Vote Duration**: The vote should last for a minimum of 3 days.
4. **Vote Options**: The vote should have at least three options: YAE (Yes), NAY (No), and ABSTAIN.
5. **Quorum**: The vote should reach a quorum of 320,000 YAE votes.
6. **Differential**: The YAE votes should exceed the second-largest vote option (either NAY or ABSTAIN) by at least 80,000.

### Proposal Cycle:

![image|1920x920](upload://fPsMYVukUCZ2OFHwDUzkFUgc9dw.jpeg)

### Special Considerations

This framework should be considered as a general template for general proposals. Specific proposals and/or frameworks, such as asset onboarding or caps updates, should follow specific guidelines as determined by the Aave DAO community.

This framework is designed to ensure that all proposals are thoroughly considered and that all votes are fair and representative of the Aave DAO community's views.

## Specification

As this proposal pertains to governance guidelines, it does not require any on-chain action or protocol change.

## Disclaimer

The ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.

## Next Steps 

1) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2) If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted.

408,"## Payload PR - BIP-613
https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/997

## Background
This BIP is to add permissions to the Balancer Multisigs as described in the payload PR linked above in order to enable the protocol to operate on [Fraxtal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-608-deploy-balancer-on-fraxtal/5746) and [Mode](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-589-enable-balancer-deployment-into-mode/5681).

It is similar to other permissions BIPs such as [BIP-388](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-388-wire-up-base-chain-in-preparation-for-launch/5026) for Base and [BIP-318](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-318-grant-avalanche-permissions/4846) for AVAX.

## Specifications

This BIP includes a number of payload files that perform various functions required to get a chain up and running.  The payloads can be found with reports in the PR linked above, and are described in the tables below.

The transaction details for `00fraxtal.json` and `00mode.json` were generated by [this script](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/action-scripts/gen_add_permissions_payload.py) with inputs and outputs in [this directory](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/staging/BIPs/BIP-613).  These files were amended with transactions to set protocol fee percentages to 50% after generation. 

The following files can be found both linked below and in the payload PR linked above:

410,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Pepe ($PEPE) to Farms!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Farm with Pepe! 

PEPE is a memecoin with no intrinsic value, expectation of financial return, formal team, or roadmap. The token is for entertainment purposes only.

#### The Farm:

Stake PEPE-USDT (0.25% fee tier) v3 LP to earn CAKE tokens!

- Farm duration: 60 days
- Farm base multiplier: **up to** 25x
- Liquidity pair: PEPE-USDT (0.25% fee tier) v3 pair
- Start time: No earlier than [end of proposal], and soon after sufficient liquidity on BSC is achieved
- Finish time: Approx. 60 days after start time

During the 60-day farm period, we request for flexibility in the farm multiplier - we will start with 6.9x CAKE rewards before gradually increasing the multiplier as liquidity in the farm grows, up to a **maximum** of 25x. 

At the end of the 60-day period, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $PEPE?

PEPE is a memecoin originated on Ethereum. Users can now bridge PEPE from Ethereum to BNB Chain [**here**](https://bridge.pepe.vip/).

#### What can I do with $PEPE?

Enjoy the memes.

414,"**Summary:**
> This pool uses the new weighted pool factory which allows us to apply the protocol fee to yield bearing tokens. bb-rf-aUSD is `Beets Reaper Aave Boosted USDC/USDT/DAI`, which means we're using a linear pool to deposit stables into Reaper Vaults which only deposit into Aave. Reaper handles the autocompounding of any OP rewards which adds additional yield. For reference, Reaper is a fork of Yearn v2 run by the Byte Masons who are talented developers in their own right. BeethovenX has a close working relationship with the Byte Masons. In the absence of an Aave v3 compatible atoken wrapper this arrangement represents the best path forward, and arguably it's better than using a wrapper since we get the additional compounding benefit. The kind of vault we're using has held 9 figures of TVL and been thoroughly battle tested so it should add a negligible risk premium. 
>
> bb-rf-aUSD represents boosted USDC, USDT, and DAI. rETH is Rocket Pool's liquid staked ETH. bb-rf-grBAL represents Reaper Granary Boosted BAL, meaning BAL is deposited into a [granary.finance](https://granary.finance/) lending pool. Aave does not support BAL as an asset on Optimism and Granary is an Aave 2 fork also run by the Byte Masons so it was decided to use Granary to provide extra yield on BAL. BEETS is the governance token of BeethovenX. 
>
> Given this pool contains BEETS which is a relatively low market cap token I believe it's appropriate this gauge enters the system with a 2% emissions cap.

**Protocol Description:**

>  USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO. USDT is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Tether. rETH is liquid staked ETH by Rocket Pool. BAL is the governance token of Balancer. BEETS is the governance token of BeethovenX.

**Motivation:**

> The goal of this pool is to generate additional trading activity around rETH and be the source of BAL & BEETS liquidity on Optimism. We're currently working with aggregators to support pools like this so for now the trading volume is likely to remain low and entirely driven by arbitrage bots. Our incentives strategy on Optimism has three components - OP incentives paired with protocol fees, BEETS emissions, and BAL emissions. In order for autocompounders to build on top of our pools we need BEETS & BAL liquidity on Optimism.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Find more information about governance on Rocket Pool's [forum](https://dao.rocketpool.net/c/governance/8).   

2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on a rate provider for rETH which the Orb Collective integrations team graciously deployed. See [here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x658843BB859B7b85cEAb5cF77167e3F0a78dFE7f).

5. **Market History:** See [here]([https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth)). 
 
6. **Value:** We will earn the protocol fee on rETH, bb-rf-aUSD, and bb-rf-grBAL yield, plus trading fees. As a reminder, protocol fees on Optimism are split 50% to Balancer (passively to DAO & veBAL) and 50% to BeethovenX. Of BeethovenX's 50%, half is returned as incentives on Optimism pools either via bribes or direct LM. The other half is split between funding the team and accumulating veBAL/auraBAL/vlAURA per this [recent proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x3d6e0373f0f1c041a82e6108a01aee2e00a21be43667259126b70e5fd2a5f93a). Thus emissions towards this gauge both benefit passive veBAL *and* serve to help our flywheel accelerate our growth on Optimism.

417,"This proposal has two principles to empower Ultrasound CAKE.


1. Increase the MAX CAPS (proposed weight gauges) for the CAKE pool from 35% to 60%.


Pros - This will undoubtedly encourage more CAKE staking, consequently strengthening the entire community and reducing selling pressure.


2. Develop a new aggressive reduction plan (around 50%) of emissions to take place over the next 4 months.


Pros - It is crucial to signal greater scarcity of CAKE to the market. All holders stand to gain from this measure. And this could happen until the BTC halving to take advantage of the bull run - THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TIMING.


Cons - This two proposals may decrease CAKE reward in farms. However, perform an analysis. There are two types of suppliers:


1. The holder
2. Those who sell CAKE to increase their APR farm.


The holder will not be bothered by these measures as they will benefit from them. However, those who sell CAKE will have two alternatives. Either they will start to become holders, which is beneficial for the community, or they will lose some selling CAKE rewards. But okay, they can continue selling, as the selling pressure will decrease significantly, and soon they will realize that selling CAKE is a bad deal.


I have been with CAKE since day 1. I saw CAKE go from $0.29 to 13, then 22, and reaching 44. 


Today, the protocol built by the devs, who deserve ENORMOUS RESPECT AND CONGRATULATIONS FROM THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY for their work, is much better than when it reached above 40. So, we need to instill more confidence to holde CAKE and to reduce the constant ""every day selling"" from farm´s by those who are only interested in increasing APR. Even these individuals should benefit because with a higher CAKE price, the supplier's CAKE reward will be greater.


Devs... it´s all about CAKE!! Let's empower Ultrasound CAKE with more deflation.",bullish

title: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Introducing StrategicAssetManager 
author: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic, @dydymoon & Fermin
created: 2023-07-05

---

# Summary

The `StrategicAssetManager` is a dedicated contract for managing Aave DAO's strategic assets. At launch the `StrategicAssetManager` will manage the DAO's veBAL holding.

# Motivation

Aave DAO is soon to attain a veBAL holding. To maximise the upside for holding the strategic asset, the DAO needs a practical means of managing the asset.

The veBAL holding needs to be continually relocked to optimise goverance and rewards. Gauge votes are weekly and would require numerous AIPs to manage the veBAL effectively. Aave DAO also has an opportunity to participate in Balancer's governance on Snapshot votes via delegating governance rights.

The StrategicAssetManage will also hold the sdCRV position if approved by AIP. Yield generated from each strategic holding can be claimed, swapped and redeposited to compound into each strategy over time. The swaps have MEV protection and can be customised to have defined maximum amount of price impact.

Given the sheer volume and frequency of transactions to be performed, there exists a desire to minimum AIP votes. The StrategicAssetManager contains the ability for the `ShortExecutor` to assign an `AssetManager`. This role can be likened to a Treasury Committee (as suggested Part 4 of SM upgrade publications) and provides the DAO optionality to introduce a committee separte from this proposal once adequate guidelines are in place. 

The contract contains an allow list which implements tight restrictions around which contracts the `AssetManager` role can interact with. Further definition relating to what the `AssetManager` can do will be defined in the [ARFC] publication.

# Specification

The below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the StrategicAssetManager:

* Deposit/withdraw voteEscrow contract 
* Lock/relock B-80BAL-WETH
* Participate in gauge votes
* Delegate governance voting rights
* Allocate boost
* Update boost
* Delegate boost
* Allow boost on Warden 
* List boost on Warden (if the  DAO votes for it)
* Claim protocol fees & other rewards 
* Transfer assets (ie: collector contracts)
* Ability to lock other strategic assets
* Receive assets from the collector
* Receive assets from the Economic Reserve

The contract is upgradeable and controlled by Aave's [`Short Executor`](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/governance-guide#the-short-executor-is-used-for-non-governance-related-proposals-such-as-asset-listing-parameter-upda) role via governance. Each function on the contract can be implemented via the `ShortExecutor` whilst also having the ability to assign and remove, a `AssetManager` role to a community elected address. There is also the possibility of having an IncentiveManager contract that could take on some of the listed functions defined above. These details will be worked through in the future.

# Next Steps

Upon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance. The [ARFC] 
publication will provide greater insights to the functions on the contract and the Treasury Committee will be a separate [ARFC].

Proposing to add a new pool cyDAI/cyUSDC/cyUSDT. This is yearn x cream Iron Bank. This proposal is not to add a gauge or burner, simply to add the swap pool. The pool has already been developed and requires no additional man hours from the core Curve team.

Abstract:

PR available for review. This is an adaptation of the y pool template to accommodate compound style c-tokens. This same format can be used for compound, cream, yearn, etc.

Motivation:

More pools allow for deeper liquidity, better trades, and greater arbitrage between pools. cy*tokens are currently idle DAI, USDC, USDT (and sUSD) that can be used for further trade depth, volume, and liquidity.

422,"-Background-
PancakeSwap is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), providing users with a wide range of DeFi services and trading options. PancakeSwap is community-driven and offers a highly efficient and secure platform for DeFi transactions. As part of our ongoing development, we seek to enable users to bridge tokens between PancakeSwap and Zora Network.

-Proposal-

Deploy the following pools and pathways for token bridging between PancakeSwap and Zora Network:
-BNB: PancakeSwap, Binance Smart Chain, Zora Network
-USDT: PancakeSwap, Binance Smart Chain, Zora Network
-CAKE: PancakeSwap, Binance Smart Chain, Zora Network

-User Incentives and Application Support-

Discussions regarding user incentives and application support will take place between the PancakeSwap Governance and the Zora Network Integration Team. Details will be documented and approved through a governance proposal.

-Liquidity incentives may be provided by PancakeSwap in the form of CAKE rewards, the exact amount to be determined based on community consensus and the Zora Network Integration Team's recommendations.

-Technical Integration and Maintenance-

PancakeSwap will ensure the technical integration of Zora Network's token bridging solution. The integration will be reviewed and maintained regularly to ensure the seamless operation of the bridging services.

Please note that the specifics of the proposal, including the pool deployment and user incentives, will be determined through collaboration and discussions between PancakeSwap and the Zora Network team.",bearish
423,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to BNB Chain v3 Farm Rewards

As we continue to optimize CAKE rewards across all of our deployments, we are able to gradually lower the overall CAKE emission, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate a smooth trading experience. Ultimately, this enables us to contribute a greater amount of CAKE towards the weekly burn. 

The previous round of [**Adjustments to Farm Rewards**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x3e68425e233875d0ed4d553e0da44bfe927f75d56714545c7a7c7ea4a9b4a35c) increased the overall CAKE burn by approximately **4,000 CAKE per day** with minimal impact to trading volumes.

Given the traction and overall market share shown on our BNB Chain v3 deployments, this proposal aims to decrease emissions to the farms listed below and increase the overall CAKE burn by approximately **1,700 CAKE per day**.

These optimizations will add up over the coming months to 1) improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across farms and 2) redirect CAKE rewards towards the highest growth farms, ultimately accelerating the path towards ultrasound CAKE.

#### Adjustment Details

With the above in mind, we are proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below. Note, all other BNB Chain v3 farms will continue to earn the same level of rewards and even with these adjustments, the farms below will continue to have a healthy level of liquidity, volume, and APR.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their average daily volume, 14-day volume, capital efficiency, and alternatives available.

Date: 2024-07-08
---
## Summary
Aave Labs is pleased to announce an event grant proposal. This proposal includes participation in key ecosystem initiatives at EthCC and Devcon among other events.

## Goals
To reinforce Aave Protocol’s unique and positive culture, share technical knowledge, and attract new community members. These initiatives are aimed at helping to continue the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem by showcasing Aave Protocol’s core values.

## Background
Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, contributors, and stakeholders.

Although the Aave Protocol has emerged as a leader within DeFi, the sector at large is still in its nascent stages, and Aave should work hard to retain its spot as a leader. For the events proposal from the DAO for 2024, Aave Labs wants to concentrate on proposing fewer but higher-quality events to maximize impact. 

## Overview
Aave Labs is requesting a grant for 650,000 GHO for events for the remainder of 2024 for EthCC Brussels (45%) and Devcon Bangkok (55%):
1. **Hackathons & Bounties:** We want to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, and to remain visible and competitive in a growing industry, but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem. We propose to sponsor one ETHGlobal hackathon in Q4 in Bangkok.
2. **Open Finance Day:** We are hosting Open Finance Day in partnership with key players in DeFi for high quality talks, networking, and light bites. Talks will include members of the DeFi community, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members and service providers. 
3. **Side Events:** Hosting side events alongside major conferences is an opportunity to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge, and industry insights. Typically featuring panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts, side events are designed to strengthen awareness of Aave and GHO technology among strategic audiences, reach new target audiences, and ensure Aave and GHO remain top-of-mind within and outside the community. 
4. **Merch:** Aave Labs seeks to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement and awareness-building efforts as well as to proliferate the new visual identity and the beloved Ronnie ghost. Aave Labs will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials and creation of merchandise people actually wear, use, and love.
5. **rAAVE:** To celebrate the Aave community’s welcoming culture, we aim to host two more editions of the flagship rAAVE event. Throughout the past years rAAVE has positioned itself to be the most sought after event in the ecosystem. They foster community spirit and create memorable experiences. We will integrate the GHO Pass for ticketing logistics and manage press relations and social media to maximize awareness and inclusion. This year’s events will be hosted at EthCC in Brussels and Devcon in Bangkok. To mitigate some costs for rAAVE, we are planning to potentially obtain co-sponsorship with current or potentially new partners for the Aave ecosystem. Due to the event’s high visibility, it is crucial that if co-sponsorship is obtained, the selected partners are aligned with the Aave Community and this is conducted in a balanced manner.

After covering the aforementioned main sponsorships, any remaining budget will be directed towards side events related to the security of DeFi and smart contract technology. Any excess funds from this grant will be rolled over to be used for events during Q1 2025. A recap on last year’s events was posted to governance last December, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-events-sponsorship-budget/14953/18).

Aave Labs shall cover all expenses for its team members, and this proposal does not request any funds for these expenses, or include any compensation for Aave Labs’ work.

## Next Steps
If Snapshot is successful, then move to AIP

 ## Conclusion
We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of 650,000 GHO for activations and events for the remainder of 2024 will not only help enrich the Aave Protocol ecosystem, but will foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition.

We look forward to the DAO’s support for this proposal for these events during 2024.",bullish

A proposal to adjust: Twenty  (20) total  Supply and Borrow Caps across eleven (11) assets on Aave V3 Avalanche

## Motivation

The objective of this proposal is to recommend updated supply and borrow caps for:

1. **V3 Avalanche stablecoins that have excessive supply caps set and/or have no set borrow cap.** 
    1. The caps are intended to allow for substantial growth compared to the current supply while not set too excessively.
    2. The recommendations for the supply caps are set to up to 40% of the circulating supply for most assets and no more than 60%. You can find the exact number for each asset in the tables below. Borrow caps are set to ~65% of the supply cap.
2.  **Assets that have reached over 75% utilization of either cap.** 
    1. The recommendations provided in this proposal were derived using Chaos Labs’ [Updated Supply and Borrow Cap Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-updated-supply-and-borrow-cap-methodology/11602). 
3. Assets with a supply cap that is >50% of the asset's total on-chain circulating supply.

428,"title: [ARFC] Freeze BUSD on Aave V2

Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative

Dated: 2023-02-13

Summary
Following the recent developments between Paxos (minter of BUSD) and the SEC,

Paxos will stop minting BUSD From the 21st of February 2023, and will only allow redemption for their underlying value by burning BUSD.

The circulating supply of BUSD will thus trend toward zero over time.

This ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to freeze BUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum market.

Abstract
This ARFC proposes to freeze the BUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum market.

Motivation
While BUSD is not an asset with borrowing power, and recent development does not present risks of excess debt, From the 21st of February 2023, the circulating supply of this asset will eventually go toward zero.

As there’s no real prospect of growth and the inability to mint new BUSD might hurt peg arbitrage opportunity and asset peg. It seems that the most reasonable path for Aave is to freeze this reserve and invite users to switch to another stablecoin among the diversity present in Aave.

As there’s no immediate risk for the protocol, the ACI doesn’t call for a fast-track process for this ARFC, and the standard governance process seems fit.

Specification

In light of the [announced migration](https://twitter.com/fiatdao/status/1598729395660722177) of FDT to BOND it is prudent for Balancer to remove the gauge for FDT/WETH. This follows in the footsteps of previous proposals, such as removing the FEI/WETH gauge when TribeDAO dissolved.

431,"**Title:** Aave Treasury Proposal: Onboard with Centrifuge Prime to invest in RWA

**Author:** @Khan 

**Date:** Sep 12, 2023

---

### **Summary**

This proposal brings on Centrifuge as a service provider to the Aave DAO to setup a legal structure to support RWA investments, develop RWA specific management and governance processes, and allocate $1M of the Aave Treasury’s stablecoin holdings to a liquid US T-Bill fund on Centrifuge, as a proof of concept investment.

This is a first step towards a long term effort for Aave to develop and launch an RWA Facilitator that will back GHO with Real World Assets. With this proposal Aave can earn yield on idle stablecoins, establish long-term RWA infrastructure for the protocol, and allow the Aave DAO to begin building internal familiarity and expertise in the RWA industry.

The proposal minimizes upfront cost and completely recoups the initial investment within 6-12mo and starts earning yield for Aave within the first 3mo. It locks up no long term capital and leaves the DAO in full control over the treasury allocation.

The main results of this proposal:
1. Aave will onboard to Centrifuge Prime to establish the legal and technical infrastructure for the Aave protocol to invest in RWAs.
1. Through Prime, the Aave Treasury will allocate $1M of USDC to the Anemoy LTF, a short-duration US treasury bill pool on Centrifuge.

### **Motivation**

Aave has long been a contributor and supporter of RWA initiatives. Since the first announcement of GHO, the Aave community has consistently expressed its interest in expanding into this area. Treasury Management at Aave has historically been focused on strategic crypto assets, ignoring the returns and liquidity available in offchain markets for various reasons.

Today, with roughly 17% of the treasury in stablecoins (~13m USD), the Aave DAO is overlooking the 5% available interest in the risk-free rate of overnight financing of US treasury assets. This can offer $250,000 of recurring revenue a year at just 5m USD of investment. These markets can immediately become some of the highest earning revenue streams for the DAO.

Beyond just economics, this proposal would allow the Aave DAO to establish and begin developing the internal RWA expertise necessary to engage with these markets. Centrifuge Prime is purpose-built for DeFi native organizations, offering the critical services and infrastructure necessary to onboard a diverse portfolio of RWA through a single interface.

Centrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWA on as collateral, and pioneered the first Aave deployment into RWA with the joint development of the RWA Market. Onboarding Aave to Centrifuge Prime for liquid investment strategies is an optimal approach for scaling RWA with the Aave community. It will develop the legal and technical infrastructure necessary to interface with RWAs safely and efficiently, while allowing the Aave community to get comfortable and familiar with the processes and thinking around RWA. This will put Aave in a significantly improved position to be able to leverage RWA collateral for GHO in the long term, either to improve liquidity or develop additional revenue streams.

### **Specification**

#### **Setting up the Aave DAO Legal Conduit**
This proposal instructs Centrifuge to initiate the setup of a legal structure for the benefit of the Aave DAO that will be ratified and deployed by a subsequent Aave token holder vote.

The process for establishing the legal framework is as follows: The Centrifuge contributor team will retain external legal counsel in the Cayman Islands to represent the Aave DAOs interests. The legal structure itself will be established per the previously discussed legal framework developed by Centrifuge. The defining documents and legal agreement team will be created to incorporate specific processes around the DAOs interaction with the foundation company. The results of this work will be presented to the Aave DAO, an analysis from the external counsel will be provided, and the community will have time to process, provide feedback, and otherwise request changes in the legal structure. The structure will only be implemented and executed with DAO approval, likely via Snapshot or other requisite process as requested by the community.

The legal structure will be integrated with DAO governance through a process defined in the legal documents, is capable of investing and holding assets on behalf of the DAO, and ultimately allow the Aave DAO full legal recourse to their investments. The legal counsel, while required under local Cayman law, is retained for the purposes of having an independent legal party to protect Aave’s interest.

The structure defines the actions the foundation can take, such as initiating investments or redemptions. Any action can be made only with approval from the DAO and providing a DAO approved “resolution” to the Foundation entity described above instructing the Foundation to act in accordance with the resolution. The specific details of this process will be developed alongside the Aave community.

This framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar structures 1. There, the same structure is used to support a >$1.2B debt ceiling, with >600m+ actively deployed.

More information on the fund, the legal framework, and the processes described here can be found in the [on going FAQ discussion here.](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)

#### **Initial pilot investment in Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund**

Once the legal structure has been defined and implemented, a specific DAO resolution will be presented to the DAO that instructs the Foundation to perform a 1M investment into the Anemoy LTF and transfers 1M USDC from the DAOs treasury into the Anemoy pool onchain.
Centrifuge will work with Aave to do an initial test investment and then a partial redemption to test out the complete rails.

#### **Scaling beyond the first transaction**

It is best for Aave to deploy into RWAs slowly. This proposal creates an initial deployment into the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund of $1M (pending DAO approval at the time investment). It is up to the community to initiate further investments, but we recommend keeping RWA allocations at a fixed cap of the overall Aave balance sheet until the community is more comfortable.

From there on, further investment and redemption actions are in full control of the Aave DAO. The process can easily be integrated to support portfolio and allocation decisions made through a more formal treasury management process, either manually or programmatically. Centrifuge is committed to supporting these efforts for the duration of this proposal’s stream.

Outside of US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the Aave DAO to allocate into the following asset classes in the future:

| Bucket| Description | Target Return | Liquidity
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Liquid | Lowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds| 5-6% | Daily
| Preservation | Investments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc. | 6-8% | 3-6 months
| Acceleration | Trade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets | 8-20% | 3-24mo |

#### **Summary Process**
In summary, the following process will be executed through this proposal:
1. Acquire Caymans Legal Counsel
1. Conduct initial legal research and analysis alongside counsel, share to forum
1. Post proposed legal documents and legal arrangement to forum, host community call, gather and implement community feedback. Arrangement will include explicit processes for management of the foundation company (i.e. investments and redemptions).
1. DAO approval of legal implementation
1. Foundation company onboards to Anemoy LTF
1. DAO proposal request for 1m of USDC investment into Anemoy LTF


**Estimated Timeline & Project Phases**


| Activity | Description | Est. Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Legal setup | Creation of Foundation Company, passing of DAO resolutions to start deployment into RWAs | 1-2 months
| Initial Deployment | DAO instructs Foundation to deploy $1M into a US Treasuries Fund and transfers $1M in USDC Stablecoins into the Anemoy LTF | 2-3mo
| Scaling up / Ongoing Operation | DAO can vote on increase allocation to Prime and direct investments towards a variety of liquid lower yielding and more longer term investments at any time | After 3mo

#### **Fees**
While there are some legal setup costs that have to be covered by the DAO upfront we limit these as much as possible.

Even at a conservative deployment of just $2M and a portfolio return equal to current US Treasury yields Aave should break-even within the first 6mo and start generating revenue for the DAO thereafter.

The legal work will be useful far beyond this initial proposal and can be the basis on which Aave onboards RWAs into GHO.

**Fees**
| Fee | Amount | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legal Setup | up to 50,000 USDC | To be paid immediately into a Safe controlled by Centrifuge to pay for lawyers and Cayman service providers to set up a Cayman foundation company to the benefit of the Aave DAO, any unused budget will be returned to the Aave treasury.
|Portfolio Fee | 0.35% p.a. on assets in Prime up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M | Paid on an ongoing basis to Centrifuge for maintaining the portfolio
|Aave Reward | 500 stkAave streamed over 2 years into the Centrifuge treasury, starting with the first 1M UDSC Deployment into Centrifuge Prime |To cover costs of resource and facilitation time for the development of the infrastructure and processes. Centrifuge DAO intends for this to create better alignment with strong skin in the game incentives for success.

# What is Boost?
Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, TRX-BNB will go from a 1x multiple to a 2x multiple, which will last for 1 week, which will only cause temporary dilution among the other farms, and at the same time, there will be a new TRX Syrup Pool with $1M of tokens, to be earned by staking CAKE.



# The Syrup Pool:
Stake CAKE tokens to earn TRX tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 16,700,000 TRX
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start block:** 9202800 (approx. 9am UTC on July 16th)
- **Finish block:** 10930800 (approx. 9am UTC on September 14th)
- **Token rewards per block:** 9.6643 TRX


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.

# What is TRON?

TRON is committed to promoting the decentralization of the Internet and is dedicated to building the infrastructure for a decentralized Internet.The TRON Protocol, one of the largest blockchain-based decentralized operating systems in the world, offers scalable, high-availability, and high-throughput support that serves as the foundation for all decentralized applications in the TRON ecosystem.The Protocol also uses an innovative, pluggable smart contract platform to improve compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts.

title: [ARFC] Set Metis Foundation Wallet as Emission Manager for METIS Token on Aave V3 Metis Pool
author: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative
date: 2023-07-05
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes to set the Metis Foundation wallet as the emission manager for the METIS token on the Aave V3 Metis pool. This will enable the Metis Foundation to define and fund incentive programs for this Aave pool, promoting growth and expanding the user base of this new Aave V3 market.

## Motivation

The Metis Foundation has expressed a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3 Metis pool. By setting their wallet as the emission manager for the METIS token, the Foundation will be able to directly fund incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets.

## Specification

The Metis Foundation wallet address is as follows:

Emission Admin Wallet (Metis Foundation): `0x97177cD80475f8b38945c1E77e12F0c9d50Ac84D`

The AIP call setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract.

`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(METIS, EMISSION_ADMIN);`

This method will set the Metis Foundation wallet as the emission admin for the METIS token.

## Disclaimer

This proposal is powered by Skyward. The Aave Chan Initiative has not been paid by any third party for this proposal.

443,"## Simple Summary

Gauntlet's risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify risk parameters, including Loan To Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across 5 assets on Ethereum v3, Arbitrum v3 and Ethereum v2. For more details, see the full forum post [here]( https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825/1).


## Motivation

These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations and they seek to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, the expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics shown in the [full forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825) can help understand why some parameter recommendations have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for the recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.
For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at reasonable levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. Our simulations show that we can improve the balance of risk and capital efficiency by making the parameter changes specified below.

Ethereum Aave v3 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|DAI Loan to Value |67%|77%
|USDC Liquidation Threshold|79%|80%
|WSTETH Liquidation Bonus|7%|6%

Arbitrum Aave v3 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|LINK Liquidation Threshold	|75%|77.5%

Ethereum Aave v2 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|SNX Liquidation Threshold|62%|59%

Lowering SNX LT by 3% will liquidate 0xf81c8b55c2499af43ec387977c1d9cb1f1c78bca, who currently has HF 1.02 and supplies $50 SNX to borrow $30 USDT.

## Risk Dashboard
The community should use [Gauntlet’s Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk.

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile insolvency value that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile liquidation volume that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

444,"## Summary

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V3 Ethereum. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-aave-v3-eth-pool-weth-parameters/15110).


## Motivation

The current yields of stETH and reth have been observed at 3.3% and 3.07% respectively. By adjusting the slope1 parameter of WETH, we aim to:

- Enhance Profitability in Leverage Loops: The proposed adjustment will make leverage loops more profitable for users.
- Align with stETH and reth Yields: The adjustment aims to set the slope1 slightly below the current yields of stETH and reth, ensuring Aave remains competitive.

Increased utilization of ETH reserve is expected to partly compensate for the slight loss of protocol revenue due to lower interest rate equilibrium.





## Specification

We propose two options for the weth slope1 parameters:

- **Option 1 (Conservative)**: Set slope1 to 3.2%. 10 bps below stETH yield but above rETH yield
- **Option 2 (Aggressive)**: Set slope1 to 2.8%. 50 below stETH yield & 23bps below rETH yield allowing both to be profitable.

Additionally, we propose reducing the optimalRatio to 80% to mitigate liquidity risks.

| Options       | new_slope1 | new_uopt | current_util | current_borrow_rate | new_util    | new_borrow_rate | current_borrow_revenue (WETH) | new_borrow_revenue (WETH) |
|--------------|------------|----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Option 1 (Conservative) | 0.033      | 0.8      | 0.74         | 0.031               | 0.75 | 0.031           | 1363                    | 1384                  |
| Option 2 (Aggressive)   | 0.028      | 0.8      | 0.74         | 0.031               | 0.8         | 0.028           | 1363                    | 1331                  |

## Protocol Description
CoW Protocol lets people swap assets MEV protected at the best exchange rate by leveraging its batch settlement layer built on top of DeFi’s favorite AMMs and DEX Aggregators. Instead of directly executing trades on-chain, users only sign their swap intention and delegate the execution to so-called solvers (aka relayers in other protocols). Solvers bid on the best possible exchange rate in order to win the right to settle trades. By batching multiple trades together in order to create CoWs (Coincidence of Wants), solvers can save on gas costs, AMM fees and execution risk. Therefore CoWs lead to structurally better prices than on any existing DEX aggregator. In the absence of CoWs solvers fall back to using the best possible on-chain route, by comparing quotes from leading aggregators.

## Motivation
Strengthen the COW and BAL communities ties by giving a reward in COW tokens for veBAL voters, while increasing BAL rewards to COW liquidity providers. More in CowDAO proposal [here](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-using-cow-to-boost-bal-rewards-for-cow-lps/783)

## Specification

1.  **Governance**: CowDAO is governed by COW and vCOW token holders through snapshot votes and forum proposals. 

2.  **Oracles**: No use of oracles in CoW Protocol

3.  **Audits**: Settlement contract [audits](https://github.com/gnosis/gp-v2-contracts/tree/main/audits). COW token [audits](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-token/tree/main/audits).

4.  **Centralization vectors**: Orderbook and solver competition are still hosted on a server although decentralizing this part of the stack is on the roadmap. The potential risk is mainly censorship of orders. No user funds are at custody. Limit prices are enforced by an immutable smart contract. 

5.  **Market History**: COW was made transferable on March 28th and was launched with [incentives to provide liquidity on Balancer](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-4-cow-liquidity-incentive-program/295/20) pools. CowDAO is [considering](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-using-cow-to-boost-bal-rewards-for-cow-lps/783) using the veBAL voting system to boost BAL rewards for COW pools.",bearish

447,"[ARC] - UI/UX upgrade governance framework
The Aave protocol is a decentralized ecosystem of smart-contracts running on several EVM networks. This ecosystem is permisionless and anyone with the required tech knowledge can freely use 100% of the Aave protocol features.

That being said, for a more accessible user experience, the Aave companies created the Aave application 4 allowing the interaction with the Aave protocol without technical knowledge.

To reinforce the decentralization of the application, the Aave app is deployed on IFPS and considering Flux hosting to avoid centralization of hosting,

also, the Aave app, is fully open source 1 and allows any developer to contribute to the improvement of the application for the benefit of the end-users.

As recently, we have witnessed multiple demands from third-parties to be integrated in the aave App (wallets, on-ramps etc…) The presented framework intends to provide governance guidelines to standardize the process of integration into the Aave App.

Title [ARC] - integrate [Entity] into the aave app
[Proposal]

[Proposed integration]
Brief presentation of the requested integration

examples:

a wallet requesting a direct support on user onboarding
an onramp requesting the integration of an onramp widget
a notification system requesting to be integrated into user’s dashboard
a portfolio tracker requesting link in users dashboard
In this section, the entity should detail which specific section of the app should be modified to integrate the entity.

[Current and proposed integration of Aave in the Entity ecosystem]
Is the Aave app highlighted in the entity application?
How does the integration benefit the Entity Aave’s current and potential future users?
[Technical integration]
Link to Aave interface PR requesting the integration
This framework is intended to provide standardization of UI/UX integration of the Aave App.

The proposed governance process for a UI integration is to have each entity do a governance thread open for at least 5 days.

Then open a snapshot vote with a starting voting period of 24h in the future with at least 3 days open vote period considered valid with a 100k AAVE YAE vote quorum.

the proposed options for the snapshot must be YAE/NAY/ABSTAIN.

The Aave interface GitHub maintainers will then review the integration PR and provided they don’t detect security issues, will merge the PR.

In the case of a security issue detected with the PR and not discussed before the snapshot vote, the GitHub maintainers will open technical communication channels with the entity in an effort to allow the integration to be merged but will keep a veto right regardless of the governance process in the case the integration is considered harmful to Aave users security.",bullish

As a team of very passionate ApeCoin DAO & Yuga community members, we want to play our part in the success of ApeChain. And we will not only support it, but even amplify it.

Introducing Blever, a cutting-edge web3 platform combining NFTs with social farming & incentivized content creation. The platform empowers teams to effortlessly bring their creations to life while enjoying unparalleled hype & attention. By leveraging social login and seamless FIAT payments, Blever provides easy access to ApeChain not only for experienced users but also for casual players and retail.

In addition to gaming, you also need fun, culture, memes, and PFPs to make ApeChain appealing and popular. Blever is designed to do just that. We see ourselves as an extended community-driven business development arm. We search for projects, support their launch, and bring them tremendous reach and engagement through social farming. Everyone wins!

With $APE being the native gas token of ApeChain we believe that bringing users/traffic/projects to the chain is probably the single most important thing the DAO can focus on in the near future.

**Driving demand for ApeChain = Driving demand for $APE**

Easy access to ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE Incentives on ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE More use cases on ApeChain → more use cases for $APE ApeChain hype → $APE hype

This is our biggest opportunity and we want to do everything we can with Blever to make the most of it.

Having already invested more than 2 months of our time and resources, we are now looking for funding from the DAO to help us achieve our goal. Let’s make ApeChain a success together

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
ApeChain needs builders, users, fun & culture.

We aim to become an *ApeChain launch partner.*

Consider us to be an *external business development arm for ApeChain.* Via our platform, we will onboard creators, users, culture & fun to ApeChain. We have already started with outreach to various brands and projects + we have existing/confirmed partnerships as well.

*Maximizing reach & engagement* for projects that launch on ApeChain: easy access to social farming & incentivized content creation will ensure that they get the hype and attention they deserve.

*Easy ApeChain onboarding* with Social Login & FIAT payments
* Social Login will allow casual gamers & retail to sign up by using their traditional login methods (such as Google, X, Meta, etc.) - no wallet needed.
* FIAT payments will allow them to pay by Credit Card or other common payment methods.
* No gas fees - we will cover them on their behalf.

This combination will enable the simplest, fastest, and smoothest onboarding process for new users! No wallet, no crypto needed - a seamless web2.5 experience for everyone ; )

*Powered by Ape(Chain) branding* - permanently placed in our footer for 1 year.

*Joint marketing efforts* via our points system: we already had initial conversations with ApeCoin DAO members. Imagine $APE & ApeChain all over your timeline ; )

*Stackable multiplier for Apes* and other partner collections like (Kodas, Mocaverse, and more) in all social farming campaigns. Making sure that our fam & frens have a headstart.
*$APE payments* - all mints on ApeChain will have ApeCoin as their default currency, creating additional demand and utility.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Radio Caca! Radio Caca is the exclusive manager of the Maye Musk Mystery Box (MPB) NFT and provides a DeFi and GameFi platform for the United States of Mars (USM) Metaverse.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn RACA tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 176,480,000 RACA
 - **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 28 Jan 22
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 27 Feb 22
 - **Token rewards per block:** 204.2 RACA

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the RACA Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a RACA-BUSD farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

#### What is RACA?

From the team: “RACA is the native token of the Radio Caca ecosystem, including a play-to-earn game Metamon Island, an NFT marketplace, and the USM 3D world. All revenue in RACA is kept in the project’s treasury and can be observed on-chain.

Presently, 40% of the trading fees on the platform are distributed to MPB holders. The remaining 60% of the fees are burned on a monthly basis.

The RACA token is the exclusive in-game currency of the Radio Caca ecosystem.”

456,"#### ABSTRACT

The goal of this proposal is to establish the ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group.

The ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group’s mandate is to:
“Build income generating projects for the ApeCoin DAO, ApeCoin Initiatives like ThankApe, Boring Security DAO, MBA licensed projects and the ApeCoin community. ApeChain will be a strong focus point once we reach that point.”

Working Groups enable a sustainable community-led infrastructure that further decentralizes the DAO, creates operational efficiency, and is flexible enough to adapt to any opportunities that may arise.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

It was recently announced that the ApeCoin DAO can receive revenue from AIPs and projects within the Ape and ApeCoin communities. There has been much talk around bringing much needed value back to the DAO and believe there needs to be a more structured focus on doing this. The ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group will focus solely on this and aims to create various projects and initiatives that will serve this exact purpose.

Working together as a community I feel we can implement various simple solutions that will drive value and needed resources back into the DAO and other initiatives alleviating the sell pressure on our much loved $APE token. In addition we expect to see the ApeChain come to life sooner, rather than later and there needs to be a strong focus on building on this to ensure it’s long term success.

If you build it, they will come…

**Summary:**

Balancer has been actively seeking yield-bearing liquidity for some time. The emergence of new DeFi primitives, like svUSD, svETH, and svBTC, are helping bridge more liquidity to Arbitrum than ever.

As Arbitrum liquidity continues to rise, a compelling opportunity arises for Savvy to replicate the achievements of Balancer's Mainnet pools on Arbitrum. This TriCrypto pool benefits Balancer by bringing a new yield-bearing DeFi primitive that benefits Savvy by opening an additional market for svTokns, and helps the ecosystem by providing a new way to earn yield.

**Protocol Description:**

Savvy is a novel platform offering non-liquidating, self-repaying, and interest-free borrowing solutions. With Savvy's cutting-edge synthetics, you can access up to 50% of your collateral's value. Whether you prefer stablecoins, Ethereum, or Bitcoin derivatives, our platform caters to your borrowing needs, allowing you to repay in a manner that eliminates the risk of liquidation. Our loans are uniquely secured against the future yield of your collateral, ensuring a secure and flexible borrowing experience—proposal to add vote gauges for our svUSD-svETH-svBTC pool.

**Motivation:**

Savvy Protocol realigns the distribution of earnings derived from the yield earned when collateral is deposited, and synthetic DeFi Primitives like svUSD, svETH, and svBTC are minted. We plan to incentivize the Balancer DEX pool with SVY emissions. To enhance efficiency and streamline the emissions process, the Balancer team recommends the implementation of a gauge. This gauge would enable the direct allocation of these incentives. As the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the pool grows, the pool becomes entitled to a larger share of incentives from Savvy Protocol. This dynamic incentivizes the pool to evolve into the primary liquidity source for the omnichain CDP suite, including svUSD, svETH, svBTC, and the various future synthetic DeFi Primitives we plan to release.

**Specifications:**

**1. Governance:**

Savvy Protocol's governance is steered by SVY, which empowers holders to participate in voting on protocol adjustments. SVY holders can propose and cast votes on changes, ensuring a democratic decision-making process. Changes ratified by the voting community do not trigger immediate implementation, safeguarding the system against potentially detrimental proposals. The Savvy DAO Council (not yet implemented) comprises co-founders, top users, and advisors. This council acts as a governing body, offering invaluable guidance and expertise.

**Oracles:**

No, the Savvy protocol and its svTokens do not require oracles.

**Audits:** This is our Halborn Audit:

https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Savvy_DeFi_Smart_Contract_Securtity_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf

**Centralization vectors:**

Currently, svUSD, svBTC, svETH operate permissionlessly. Anyone can deposit funds and mint Savvy's svTokens up to 50% max loan to value, taking out an interest-free, non-liquidating, and auto-repaying loan. Centralization factors are very shallow, meanwhile. The most significant factor is that smart contracts are proxy upgradeable. However, our deployer is a multisig 3/7 and our treasury is also multisig to do anything meaningful, like upgrades to contracts. We require and additional 3/7 Multisig to make any changes.

**Market History:**

It's important to note that the token history for assets like svUSD, svBTC, and svETH is relatively recent, with their introduction occurring in June of this year. These tokens represent synthetic derivatives, and while they are over-collateralized, they should not be mistaken for stablecoins. Unlike traditional stablecoins, svTokens can fluctuate in price and may exhibit slight variations compared to the underlying tokens used for their minting. Savvy always honors the redemption of svTokens for the underlying collateral at 1:1, regardless of market conditions. This distinction is crucial to understand, as it underscores the unique characteristics of these synthetic assets within the ecosystem.

**Value:**

The overwhelming demand for leverage has been a driving force behind Savvy swap pools on the secondary market, frequently encountering liquidity shortages. This high demand can make it challenging for users to access the assets they need when trading svTokens. However, introducing the tricrypto pool is a game-changer. It enables users to seamlessly exchange one svToken for another, addressing a significant limitation that users previously faced. This innovation allows for more flexibility, arbitrage, and convenience in trading these synthetic assets, ultimately improving the user experience within the Savvy ecosystem.

Allocate 13,000 APE to sponsor a Prop House 27 program for the Meebits community, with the goal of the program being:
- Expand $APE utility to other NFT communities.
- Develop a more efficient way to issue micro-grants to community projects than the current AIP process.

Microgrants of 1,000 APE each will be allocated across 3 rounds. Each round will begin with a 10 day period, where anyone can request funding for an idea that will 1) expand the functionality and awareness of Meebits; and 2) incorporate ApeCoin as a payment method if payments are involved.

466,"According to the tokenomics (https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics), 27,513 CAKES are minted to the farm and 10,080 CAKES to the pool daily. 

This results to Farm: 10,042,245 CAKES minted ~2.59% inflation annually and to Pool: 3,679,200 CAKES minted ~0.95% inflation annually.

Note: Our closest competitor, Uniswap, has an annual emission rate of 2% for token staking for Governance and 0% for the farm. 

It is evident that the Pancakeswap team has made tremendous efforts to achieve Ultrasound cake and deserves congratulations. However, it no longer makes sense in the tokenomics (as it was important in the past) for the farm to earn more than those who believe in the token - holders in pools for Governance. Otherwise, we will not have long-term price support as Uniswap does. This is not fair to a team that build as much as Pancakeswap team nor to the community.

It is necessary to decrease emissions for the farm to accelerate Ultrasound CAKE. Remembering that the market value of CAKE is ~$447,090,114, and Uniswap is ~$3,720,731,550, it is not fair for Pancakeswap to have only 12% of the market value with a community and a team as strong as Pancakeswap's.

467,"# PancakeSwap Welcomes Back TrueUSD to Syrup Pool!


CAKE holders, today we are delighted to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from TrueUSD, the world’s most transparent stablecoin, fully collateralized and independently attested live on-chain.



# What is Boost?
Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, TUSD-BUSD will go from a 1x multiple to a 2x multiple, which will last for 7 days, which will only cause temporary dilution among the other farms, and at the same time, there will be a new TUSD Syrup Pool with $1M of tokens, to be earned by staking CAKE.



# The Syrup Pool:

- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start block:** 9792850[ (approx. 5am UTC on August 6th)](https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/9792850)
- **Finish block:** 11520850 [https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/11520850](https://)
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.5787 TUSD


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.

# What is TrueUSD?



What is TrueUSD?

TrueUSD (TUSD) is the first independently-verified digital asset redeemable 1-for-1 for US Dollars. The ERC20 stablecoin uses multiple banks, escrow accounts, and third-party attestations to reduce counterparty risk, provide transparency, and prevent fraud. 

TUSD offers liquidity on dozens of leading exchanges, DeFi protocols, and is supported by major OTC desks. TUSD also supports nearly instant minting and redemption speeds through the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) and PrimeX by PrimeTrust.

TrueUSD users also enjoy direct-to-bank redemption through a memorable 5-character TUSD Redemption Address.

468,"# Motivation

Balancer recently [launched](https://op.beets.fi/#/pools) on Optimism in collaboration with BeethovenX. This deployment will soon utilize veBAL gauges for BAL emissions so it is important that BAL maintains adequate liquidity and price equivalence with Ethereum. To get around the 7 day withdrawal period on the official Optimism bridge which breaks the necessary arbitrage loop with Ethereum I have enlisted the help of [Multichain](https://multichain.xyz/). They have added support for BAL between Ethereum and Optimism, however [it requires liquidity to be functional](https://docs.multichain.org/for-partners/for-partners/faq).

Thus, I propose allocating BAL from the treasury for this purpose. Please see the poll at the bottom which will serve as a temp check on the amount. Note that we would earn [bridge fees](https://medium.com/multichainorg/anyswap-fees-explained-bceddf535b83) on any funds deposited for bridge liquidity.

The treasury [currently holds ~4M BAL](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f/balances) so you can calculate the impact to the treasury from there depending on your poll choice.

# Risk

* Multichain is exploited and our BAL is lost. You can find information about [their security model here](https://docs.multichain.org/getting-started/security/security-model).

* Users only bridge in one direction, i.e. Optimism-> Ethereum and instead use the official bridge for Ethereum-> Optimism. This would see bridge liquidity on one side drained and we would be unable to withdraw our BAL until this was resolved somehow.

# Specification

If approved, 40,000 BAL would be sent from the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` to the LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` and deposited 50/50 on both sides of the bridge.",bearish
469,"#### Upgrade of Magpie’s Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift Magpie’s Farm rewards from the current MGP-BUSD v2 LP to the new MGP-BNB v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the MGP-BNB v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the MGP token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current MGP price.)

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new Farm will have doubled emissions for the first 7 days. For example, if the v2 farm is emitting 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will emit 20 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 10 CAKE per day thereafter. 

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake MGP-**BUSD** LP, earn CAKE
- 2x multiplier
- **84 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.25% fee tier):
- Stake MGP-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 4x multiplier (8x multiplier for the first 7 days)
- 168 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and **84 CAKE per day** thereafter 

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 4x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### What is Magpie?

Magpie is a multi-chain platform providing Yield & veTokenomics boosting services.

Magpie aims to:
- Help liquidity providers generate boosted yields without the need for locking WOM
- Enable WOM holders to earn passive income from their idle WOM tokens
- Enable Wombat Exchange voters to acquire Wombat Exchange voting power in a cost-effective manner

#### What is $MGP?
From the team: “MGP has the following utilities:
- Revenue sharing
- Delegated voting power on Wombat Exchange”

470,"Request for feedback: Options for tBTC pools

Discussion: https://gov.curve.fi/t/request-for-feedback-options-for-tbtc-pools/841

The tBTC team proposes adding a tBTC/wBTC or tBTC/[renBTC/sBTC/wBTC] pool. Adding a tBTC pool will further increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum and make it easier to swap between assets.

Abstract

tBTC is a Bitcoin sidechain on Ethereum, built to give Bitcoin the capabilities of Ethereum and bring additional collateral to DeFi. The asset (TBTC) is an ERC-20 pegged to Bitcoin, it can be minted or redeemed for BTC by anyone and without intermediaries. Instead of relying on a single custodian like wBTC or federation of custodians like Liquid, tBTC is supported by a decentralized bonded multi-federated peg model using ECDSA technology.

tBTC is built on the Keep Network, and as of launching this week already has 24.21M USD locked in the network (22.69M USD in KEEP, 1.39M USD in ETH and 0.26M USD in BTC). We’ve decided to launch slowly and safely with a 9 week graduated cap, currently the cap is at 100 BTC but will rise to 250 later this week. [See the full schedule here](https://blog.keep.network/tbtc-the-safe-way-to-use-bitcoin-in-defi-is-live-on-tbtc-network-de2bb8b6eaf7). Future plans for tBTC include pointing at least 5% of the KEEP supply at various liquidity rewards.

Motivation

With several BTC on Ethereum choices out there, the tBTC team wants to gauge the Curve community’s appetite for a tBTC pool. Our team’s initial thought was to keep it simple with a tBTC/wBTC pool, but are also interested in hearing about interest in something like a tBTC/[renBTC/wBTC/sBTC] pool.

Please vote below or submit options for other assets you’d like to see in a pool.

Specification

The tBTC contracts just went live: https://etherscan.io/token/0x8dAEBADE922dF735c38C80C7eBD708Af50815fAa

tBTC is fully open source and has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence, Sergei Delgado (an independent BTC researcher) and Trail of Bits. [See audit details](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc#security)

More pool options for Bitcoin on Ethereum will bootstrap liquidity as this tokenized Bitcoin grows as a whole.

472,"**Authors: Uniswap Accountability Committee**

## TLDR:

* Today, Uniswap governance, via the timelock address, has the ability to declare a new v3/v2 deployment as official/canonical
* The DAO has set a precedent for approving EVM-based deployments over the past 2 years
* This proposal seeks to give the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig agency over altering the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth & v2deployments.uniswap.eth subdomains
* This will allow the Committee to edit these text records whenever a new v3/v2 deployment is complete without having to go through an onchain vote
* To accommodate for this change, we are also proposing an alteration to the current deployment governance process to increase efficiency
* The DAO will retain the right to assign incentive distributions from the treasury to these deployments via an onchain vote

## Our Proposal

**We are proposing to enable the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig to alter the subdomains as soon as a deployment’s RFC passes the 7-day discussion period–given there are no major points of contention during the RFC phase.** The RFC should give ample time to the DAO to make a decision regarding the deployment without having to partake in a 4+ week governance ordeal. And to make sure voters have a say in this process, we are including a 5-day challenge period that will be a part of the onboarding package temperature check--this will allow voters to voice their dissenting opinion regarding a deployment. 

Currently, the Uniswap DAO, more specifically the timelock address (0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC) owns AND manages both subdomains. This proposal would make the Accountability Committee the manager of the subdomains. If at any time the DAO would like to alter the manager again or regain control, this can be done via an onchain vote since the timelock still owns the subdomains.

### New Proposed Deployment Process:

**Step 1**

* If a chain wants to deploy Uniswap, they typically connect with either the Foundation, the Accountability Committee, a delegate, or any adjacent party
* Anyone is able to author an RFC, whether it be a delegate, the destination chain themselves, or whoever else. That RFC is posted on the forum for a minimum of seven days to allow a discussion to transpire
* The deployer can either have the contracts deployed at this point or not–if the deployment is complete, then include the contracts in the RFC
* **If no issues arise in the RFC, then the deployment will be viewed as approved, and a 5-day challenge period will be rolled into the onboarding package snapshot vote**

**Step 2.1 (Work for the Deployer and Accountability Committee)**

* If deployment hasn’t already been completed, then it must be done after the RFC phase
* As soon as contracts are deployed and verified, ensuring that the bytecode of the deployed contracts matches the bytecode of the mainnet contracts, **the Accountability Committee has the authority to write the relevant text to the subdomain**
* The Committee will comment on the RFC confirming that the contracts have been verified and that the subdomain has been properly updated

**Step 2.2 (Work for the DAO and Accountability Committee)**

* The Committee will hold a temperature check to see if there’s interest in deploying incentives on the new fork--this vote also acts as the challenge period
* If passed, an onchain vote will take place, sending the selected amount of capital to the Committee multisig for distribution

***Both Step 2.1 & 2.2 can take place concurrently*

## Technical Implementation:

The onchain proposal needs to include the function calls below to grant the Accountability Committee write permissions to the subdomains. The DAO will maintain ownership of the primary domain, uniswap.eth, and thus have the ability to revoke permission through a governance vote.

**For Uniswap v3 Subdomain:**
```solidity
setOwner(
    node = 0x0b9638d2c5bd4528d603562a1fa1e734fe1b88e680f448d779531e9bc2b55f12, 
    owner = 0x3B59C6d0034490093460787566dc5D6cE17F2f9C

474,"[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum.](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-liquidity-staking/243). The proposed code to implement it can be found [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/tree/liquidity-staking).

# TLDR:

Proposal to have 45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity between BAL and uncapped tokens (WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC). Wallets flagged as Balancer Labs shareholders don't qualify for this ""liquidity staking"" extra incentive.
The main goals are to significantly increase liquidity on key BAL pairs and to allow non-shareholders to compound their BAL holdings at a much faster pace, accelerating protocol decentralization.

![image|621x500, 50%](upload://5S3GvpjON1hNGnO7wuSfqNd3smk.png)   


# Motivation

The **importance of BAL liquidity** can't be overstated:

* *TRUER PRICE DISCOVERY*: it improves trading conditions for all market participants (lower spreads and less slippage for both buyers and sellers), allowing for a more transparent and effective price discovery process;

* *SUPERIOR LP INCENTIVES*: a stronger token (with higher price inertia) results in a higher quality for the incentives given to LPs (liquidity providers) via liquidity mining;

* *SHARPER GOVERNANCE*: it opens doors to a new class of invaluable stakeholders and protocol governors (e.g. larger investors, especially those heavily involved in and experienced with DeFi protocols);

* *BROADER GOVERNANCE*: with no participation from Balancer Labs' shareholders (more on that later), liquidity staking will accelerate BAL distribution and protocol decentralization by giving all other BAL holders the opportunity to compound their governance rights at a much faster pace;

* *SAFER GOVERNANCE*: pools are non-custodial and BAL in them retain full voting power (i.e. no need to withdraw liquidity to vote), such that high liquidity and a healthy governance are not in conflict;

Balancer itself being a DEX, it feels only natural as the ideal venue for high BAL liquidity to be incentivized. Finally, it's worth noting that allowing a high portion of the token supply to be concentrated on *centralized* exchanges could expose the governance to significant risks, as illustrated by the episode with STEEM.


# Recapping: how liquidity adjustment currently works

The 145k BAL [weekly distribution](https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/bal-liquidity-mining) to LPs on Balancer is calculated proportionally to the *adjusted* liquidity contributed by each LP. This adjustment is made by applying (i.e. multiplying) a few *factors* to their liquidity measured in dollar terms.

Naturally, the value of those factors can be:
* equal to `1`, having no effect;
* less than `1`, acting as a penalty (when the liquidity is deemed less useful);
* greater than `1`, acting as an extra incentive.

A `feeFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-feefactor-toward-reducing-the-mining-penalty-for-high-fee-pools/103)) applies a small penalty to pools with higher fees.

**For each pair inside a pool**, we apply:
*  a `wrapFactor` of:
   * `1.0` for uncorrelated pairs (no penalty),
   * `0.2` for [soft pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-wrapfactor-applying-a-0-2-factor-to-soft-pegged-pairs/138),
   * `0.1` for [hard pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/wrapfactor-penalizing-pairs-of-equivalent-tokens-in-liquidity-mining/28); and 

* a `BRF` (BAL & Ratio Factor), which is the combination of a `ratioFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/introduction-of-a-weight-ratio-factor-in-liquidity-mining/15)) and a `stakingBoost ≥ 1` (described in [this proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102) and with further calculation details specified in its [ammendment](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102/4)). 
`BRF = stakingBoost * ratioFactor`
  * If the pair is **not** of type `{BAL & uncapped_token}` (uncapped tokens currently being: WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC, BAL), then its `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. the incentive doesn't apply to this pair).

The current `BRF` will only depend on the characteristics of the pool (its tokens and weights), and may have a maximum value of `1.54`. It looks like this:

![image|690x455, 75%](upload://xqztRzplangZYzS0j70jlwfgc7P.png) 

After looping through all possible pairs in a pool, we combine their factors (via [weighted average](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/master/lib/factors.js#L111)) and the result is a `wrapFactor` and a `BRF` for the whole pool. 

Finally, we calculate and apply a `tokenCapFactor` adjusting down the liquidity of a token when it exceeds a predetermined maximum. Except for the 5 uncapped tokens already mentioned, all tokens eligible for liquidity mining are currently capped at $10M each. See more details on [how to calculate it](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56) and the [recent changes](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217) to how token caps will evolve.

# The Proposal

This is a proposal to have **45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity staking**.

This extra incentive is:

> all BAL distributed as a result of applying a `stakingBoost > 1` to the liquidity of `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs, from wallets which are not flagged as shareholders of Balancer Labs.

The remaining **100k BAL would be distributed to all LPs** in all eligible pools, disconsidering the effect of a `stakingBoost` (i.e. all liquidity being subject to `BRF = ratioFactor`).

The constant value now would be: `STAKERS_SHARE = 45000 / 145000`, and we can then calculate the unique value for `stakingBoost` that satisfies this target distribution. 

The intended result is for BAL liquidity on Balancer to increase substantially, **but in a self-regulated way**. 

The simple yet powerful idea is: as BAL liquidity gets higher the extra incentive to staking gets **diluted among stakers**, so that our constant target for `STAKERS_SHARE` is met.

In a more visual approach:
 
* when non-shareholder BAL liquidity is low, the `stakingBoost` will be high, resulting in a high `BRF` (a hypothetical scenario being the **orange** curve in the graph below, in which `BRF` peaks at `12`), so there will be a *very strong* incentive for BAL liquidity to increase;

* when non-shareholer BAL liquidity is high (the desired scenario), the `stakingBoost` will have come down to lower levels, resulting in a lower BRF (a hypothetical scenario being the **green** curve below, in which `BRF` peaks at `3`).

![image|621x500](upload://oI5XnPgsZE1VcQWDyeJCWovr1IV.png)  

# Calculating the stakingBoost: a practical example

We first calculate the `liquidityPreStaking`: the total adjusted liquidity from applying all factors, but with `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. `BRF = ratioFactor`). Let's say the result was $200M.

We will need to apply a yet unknown stakingBoost so that:
```STAKERS_SHARE = (finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / finalLiquidity```

... which can also be stated as:
```finalLiquidity = liquidityPreStaking / (1 - STAKERS_SHARE)```

In our example:
```finalLiquidity = $200M / (1 - 45000/145000) = $290M```

We may apply any temporary `tempStakingBoost > 1` to `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs from non-shareholder LPs, resulting in a `tempLiquidity`. Let's say our result was $230M. This would mean the `tempStakingBoost` increased the adjusted liquidity in $30M, while what we actually want is an increase of $90M.

Now to get the desired `stakingBoost`, we only need to ""stretch"" or ""shrink"" the `tempStakingBoost` according to the ratio between the two liquidity adjustments (desired & temporary):

```
(finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / (tempLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
```
... which in our example would result in:
```
(290 - 200) / (230 - 200) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
stakingBoost = 3 * tempStakingBoost
```

# Shareholder Addresses

An important aspect of this proposal is that Balancer Labs shareholders (investors, advisors and founders) seem aligned with the spirit of the proposal: to accelerate governance rights distribution. In order to achieve this goal, their wallets will be excluded from participating in liquidity staking. This restriction doesn't apply to eventual BAL they hold that are unrelated to their shareholder allocations, for instance BAL bought on the market or earned through being LPs with tokens other than their BAL shareholder allocation.

[Here is the complete list of shareholder addresses to be excluded from liquidity staking](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/liquidity-staking/src/users.ts).

Note: wallets currently tagged as ""Balancer: Shareholder XX"" on Etherscan are actually *vesting smart contracts* which hold mostly locked (i.e. yet unvested) BAL. Vesting happens continuously and linearly over a period of 3 years which started at token launch (2020-06-20). When finally vested (i.e. free to transfer), BAL can only be withdrawn to the respective beneficiary address of each vesting contract. The addresses listed above are the 51 unique beneficiaries of the 51 vesting contracts. All the BAL balance they already hold is vested.

The community is willing to tolerate up to about 10k BAL per week per shareholder being sent to centralized exchanges as they are cognizant of shareholders also seeking to deleverage their BAL positions over time, without attempting to subvert the exclusion list. In case some large BAL balances move to third-party custody solutions held in segregated addresses or to multisig wallets (both situations are likely to happen), the current list may be updated to reflect those new shareholder addresses as also excluded from liquidity staking.

The community will have the prerogative to update this list so that changes are effective already before any still pending weekly distribution.",bullish
475,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) and increase Liquidation Bonus (LB) and Reserve Factors (RF) for eleven (11) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.

## Motivation

In line with our ongoing commitment to reduce the potential risks associated with V2 markets, we suggest a phased reduction of the **frozen** V2 markets, comprising low-to-medium cap assets with limited liquidity. The following proposal is the first step to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets, which will be followed up with more detailed plans for additional parameter updates for these assets. 

### LT Reductions

Implementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a ""moderate"" and an ""aggressive"" approach for the preliminary LT reduction. 

- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) -  This option suggests a LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://chaos-labs.notion.site/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-6-23-338308b47db34c30a92204805f2a1972?pvs=4).
- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% or the value suggested by the aggressive approach.

- “Aggressive”

| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BAL | 70% | 55% | $60 | 5 |
| BAT | 70% | 52% | $610 | 6 |
| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |
| DPI | 70% | 42% | 0 | 0 |
| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |
| KNC | 70% | 1% | $1,790 | 7 |
| MANA | 75% | 62% | $500 | 5 |
| REN | 60% | 40% | $1,800 | 6 |
| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |
| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |
|ZRX|65%|45%|$500 | 5 |
- “Moderate”

| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BAL | 70% | 60% | 0 | 2 |
| BAT | 70% | 60% | $200 | 3 |
| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |
| DPI | 70% | 60% | 0 | 0 |
| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |
| KNC | 70% | 60% | $210 | 1 |
| MANA | 75% | 65% | $400 | 4 |
| REN | 60% | 50% | $300 | 4 |
| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |
| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |
|ZRX|65%|55%| 0 | 0|

In the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:

|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| moderate | $1,970 | 20 |
| aggressive | $4,900 | 34 |

*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*

### Reduce LTV to zero

Lowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero can potentially curb borrowing by less sophisticated users. It's important to note that due to V2's design, users can bypass the LTV limit to borrow up to the LT value.

### RF Increase

Progressively increasing the reserve factors diminishes the interest rate for providing these assets and lowers the suppliers' incentive to supply the assets. In this proposal, we suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.

### LB Increase

We recommend increasing the LB for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10% to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.

Proposal to add the XSTUSD/3CRV pool to the Gauge controller to enable users to assign a gauge weight and mint CRV.

Describe what this proposal is about

This proposal is aimed at adding XSTUSD-3CRV to the gauge controller.

This way XSTUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin of SORA and Polkadot & Kusama can play a more significant role on Curve and add value to it’s community.

Protocol Description:

SORA is a new economic system aimed at creating a supranational, decentralized central bank with built-in tools for DeFi. The SORA network implements a new way of parachain architecture on Polkadot and Kusama network, with the external bridges.

XSTs are the synthetic assets for the SORA ecosystem. Unlike other synthetix which are backed by some collateral token, XST is backed by the special liquidity source of XOR.

XST is minted by burning XOR, which will mint XST through a liquidity source built in to Polkaswap. XSTUSD is an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the USD through the value of DAI.

A single XSTUSD is a claim for 1 US$ worth of XOR, and not a claim for actual US$.

More information on XSTUSD is available in the following links:

Describe the proposed asset(s), the corresponding protocol(s), and historic prices of the token (price must come from the source of highest liquidity).

Motivation:

Thanks to a combination of XSTUSD’s unique liquidity source that requires XOR to be burnt in order to mint XST, this stablecoin is at a unique advantage in the Polkadot & Kusama space as SORA recently secured a Kusama parachain. With Parity’s ongoing work to set up a KSM-DOT bridge progressing smoothly, the bases are set for XSTUSD to propagate.

It is important to note that $1 of XSTUSD is equivalent to $1 worth of XOR and as an algorithmic stablecoin there is no overcollaterization for minting, additionally, there is no additional protocol fee to to swap XSTUSD for XOR.

The motivation to add a gauge on Curve is to increase the demand and establish an additional use for XSTUSD, the cross-chain algorithmic stablecoin. This would positively impact Polkaswap as it’s liquidity source, and the subsequent DOTSAMA ecosystem through the parachain and bridge. The current XSTUSD Curve pool is a result of a development proposal that the SORA community voted, which approved $600,000 of bribes for Votium over the span of 4 months. You can find the approved proposal [here](https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps/blob/master/open_rfps/XSTUSDonCurve.md).

These are the key motivations to participate for a gauge, as we believe this would benefit the Curve community, the entire SORA community, as well as the Polkadot & Kusama space.

Please answer in a short and clear manner.



1. Governance: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain. \
XSTUSD governance is managed by the SORA Governance system.

Currently on-chain voting with XOR tokens is used, which is the same method for democracy as in [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) and [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/). However, in the future the [SORA Parliament](https://sora-xor.medium.com/the-sora-parliament-af8184dae384) will take over decision making like this, using random sortition to choose subsets of decision makers.



1. Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol. \
The protocol relies on it’s in-house developed oracles called SORAcles. These will be finished in May 2022 \

1. Centralization vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

XSTUSD gets it’s price data from the XOR-DAI price, so there is nothing that needs updating by humans; it’s all on-chain.



1. Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past?

XSTUSD has an increasing quality of peg since it’s launch in October 2021.

title: ARC - Strategic Partnership with Balancer Part #2
status: Discussion
author: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham
created: 03-05-2022

---

# Simple Summary

Acquire 100,000 BAL tokens by deploying a Bonding Curve contract. The BAL tokens are to be held in the Reserve Factor until further details relating to Aura emerges and then the Aave community can determine if to deploy BAL to receive veBAL or auraBAL, [1].

# Abstract

Deploy a Bonding Curve to acquire an additional 100,000 BAL tokens on market at the chainlink oracle price +50 bps, for a cost $1,708,500 assuming a BAL price of $17. This is an additional purchase to the 200,000 BAL token swap being considered.

Aave will become one of eight token holders with 300,000 BAL tokens. All 100,000 BAL tokens are to be retained in the Reserve Factor until such time as further information on auraBAL emerges.

# Motivation

The original motivation for performing a token swap with Balancer can be found on the ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token, [2].

With the additional 100,000 BAL acquisition, Aave would transition from just outside the Top 50 BAL holder to inside the Top 30 holders, [3]. If an additional 75,000 BAL was acquired, totalling 375,000 BAL, then Aave would become a Top 20 holder and this includes three community wallets, one Polygon bridge pool and the main BAL liquidity pool. So really it would be more like the Top 15 holders if another 75,000 BAL was acquired.

With 300,000 BAL tokens, Aave would have the largest BAL holding of any strategic partner Balancer has partnered with. The largest strategic partnership holding to date is the 270,000 BAL position held by Tribe DAO, [4,5]. Having a larger BAL holding relative to Tribe DAO may become a competitive advantage as Tribe DAO seeks to direct TVL to Rari Fuse pools with the use of the new ERC-4626 vault, [6].

With the emergence of ERC-4626, a new type of vault, whereby Liquidity Providers (LP) can deposit their stakes BPT tokens into lending pools and earn BAL rewards whilst using staked BPT as collateral, [7]. This is particularly appealing for staked BPT holdings which have minimal Impermanent loss risk. An example would be to use the staked BPT token for the stable coin Balancer Boosted Pool which uses Aave V2 to generate yield and receives BAL rewards, [8]. Based upon the success of wstETH being listed on Aave V2, this may lead to significant Total Value Locked (TVL) growth for Aave which makes up more than 13% of Aave’s mainnet V2 market TVL, [9].

Having not yet entered in the Curve / Convex tokenomics play, Aave has an opportunity to be an early leader in the veBAL wars. With the emergence of Aura, the Aave community has a choice to determine if the 100,000 BAL to be acquired are to be deployed for veBAL or auraBAL. If Aura is like Convex, then being early and building an Aura holding is worth considering. The first step in both strategies is to acquire a sizable BAL position and as the initial 200,000 BAL is proposed to be deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year, the 100,000 BAL detailed within this proposal can be deployed into either veBAL or auraBAL contracts.

There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using either veBAL or auraBAL to vote for BAL rewards towards pools that create TVL for Aave is a strategic advantage. If Aura evolves like Convex did, then the voter locked AURA token will have more voting influence over BAL rewards than one veBAL token. Being prepared and ready for the Aura token launch is going to position Aave to maximise the upside from its investments as rewards often favour early movers.

# Implementation

A Bonding Curve deployment utilising Chainlink’s BAL/USD oracle feed with a 50 bps incentive for arbitrage trades to acquire BAL on market and deposit into the contract. Aave will provide USDC to fund the Bonding Curve contract. An example of this type of transaction occurred when Tribe purchased $10M of DPI on market, [10].

The 50 bps fee is to provide an economic incentive for arbitrage traders to attain BAL on market and deposit BAL into the contract profitably by more than offsetting gas costs. This mechanism enables everyone within defi to participate and essentially crowdsources the BAL tokens on Aave’s behalf. Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor.

482,"Summary
Venus has a 7-figure treasury which is available to fund growth and community initiatives, part of which can be used to fund grants. Currently, there is no standardized process for the community to allocate from the treasury to fund proposals in a reliable and repeatable manner.

To ensure the community’s agenda is made visible, transparent and actionable for funding development of our ecosystem, while organizing these activities in a decentralized manner, a community-led grants program is proposed, “Venus Grants Program”. The goal of the program is to develop and grow the Venus ecosystem in a scalable fashion. Many ideas for improving the Venus protocol are generated across various channels, so Venus Grants Program aims to provide a bridge between those ideas and resources to execute them.

To ensure the program is administered in a decentralized manner that aligns to the community’s interests, a committee that oversees grant funding decisions is proposed. The committee’s charter is to review and disburse grant funding efficiently and in a manner that supports the community’s interests and develops our ecosystem.

Reviewers will ensure all members are acting in good faith, and will operate a 4 of 7 Multisig wallet to disburse funds to awardees. Any excess funds will be returned to the Venus Treasury. Thus far, we have the Head of DeFi for Ankr, CEO of LayerZero (Brian Pellegrino), and we are in the process of recruiting two more individuals, as well as a Grants Lead.

484,"**Summary:**

> This pool uses the new weighted pool factory and will also be utilizing the new composable stable pool form of bb-a-usd pool to pair with wstETH. This means yield earned by the both halves of the pool will only be taken by the protocol in one iteration. Due to the nature of the assets, this gauge would automatically gain “core pool” status under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.

**Protocol Description:**

**Motivation:**

> Balancer in the short term is strategically position itself as gaining control and market share of the yield bearing asset market through the use of our various pool types. This use case will not only put two yield bearing assets to work but pair greatly in terms of liquidity path for the underlying stable tokens along with wstETH. The yield bearing aspects benefit LPs and the the protocol overall, while permitting a healthy and low friction trade route for aggregators and direct traders to tap in to.

487,"The Stable v2 pool factory was [deployed](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220609-stable-pool-v2) around 2 months ago. The composableStable pool factory was [deployed ](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220906-composable-stable-pool)less than a week ago. The Weighted v2 pool factory was [deployed ](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220908-weighted-pool-v2)less than a week ago. The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable the historical Gauntlet multisig and a multisig controlled by the Balancer Maxis to control certain parameters of the Stable Pool v2 contract to increase their capital efficiency and returns to liquidity providers. The Emergency subDAO will also be granted certain permissions.

# Authorize the Emergency subDAO to pause the pools

Just like with previous pools, these new pools have an emergency pause period which is hardcoded at 3 months from the time the factories were deployed. During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. Funds can always be withdrawn by users, even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.

Since gathering 6/11 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also authorizing the [Emergency subDAO](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197) to pause the system. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Governance Multisig nor the Emergency subDAO will have any pause power. This authorization only applies to the composableStable and weighted v2 pool types.

# Authorize Balancer Maxis to manage pool parameters

Each pool’s smart contract contains a series of parameters that affect their efficiency and can be tuned depending on market conditions. The Balancer Maxis have been managing fees and the amplification factor for weighted and stable pools historically, and this would grant them the ability to do so for the new pool types below if this proposal is approved by the community. Any updates to a pool’s parameters will be announced in Discord beforehand.

* Stable Pools v2:
  * swap fee
  * amplification parameter
* composableStable:
  * swap fee
  * amplification parameter
* Weighted v2:
  * swap fee

488,"I propose a vote to make the syrup pools last longer. 

As you can see, once that GMT Syrup pool runs out we are going to be in a lot of trouble with not having any syrup pools.  23,000,000 CAKE is staked in that one Syrup Pool. 

I purpose to make the Syrup Pools last 120 Days at half the current APR%.  Make the Syrup Pools Pay out Slower. 

 
 We could even go as far as making them last 180Days and payout 66% slower.  

The APRs of the Syrup Pools would be 30% - 40%, but the Syrup pools will last longer. This will give more projects time to launch on Pancakeswap and for current projects to add more tokens to extend their Syrup Pools.  

It will also help investors not worry about dumping their Cake when big pools like the GMT are going to expire.",bearish

This is a proposal to allocate some small portion of the Balancer ecosystem grant fund toward public goods.

We developers and community members of the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement recognize that, more often than not, we stand on the shoulders of giants. Decentralized Finance (DeFi), as well as the wider Ethereum and cryptoasset ecosystem, is a group effort and we can all do our part to make this technological revolution a reality. As a core building block within DeFi, the Balancer protocol directly benefits from any and all growth within the DeFi economy. As such, it would behoove us all to give back to the community that has enabled Balancer’s unparalleled growth over the last several months. Let’s help plant the seeds for some of next big Ethereum projects.

[Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/?) Round 7 began three days ago on September 15 and will run until October 2. Let’s get this proposal passed this weekend so that the Balancer community can become a matching partner for this round!

title: [ARFC] Aave Governance v3 pre-approval
discussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-governance-v3/12367
shortDescription: Pre-approval for the Aave Governance v3 system, and its dependencies: a.DI and Robot v3
author: @bgdlabs
created: 2023-07-10
---

## Summary
This vote asks for approval from the community on 3 interdependent projects developed together within the Aave <> BGD Labs scope: Aave Governance v3, a.DI (Aave Delivery Infrastructure) and Aave Robot v3.

## Context
One of the main developments included into the Aave <> BGD Labs engagement was the next iteration of the governance system of Aave: v3.

In order to enable it, being heavy on cross-chain communication, we have also developed a.DI, a cross-chain communication abstraction layer of smart contracts.
Additionally, an instance of the already approved Aave Robot will be deployed for Governance v3, as layer of permissionless automation.
All of them, and specially Aave Governance and a.DI are inter-dependant.

Extensive information about the 3 components can be found on the following links, including architecture, flows, voting assets or initial underlying bridge providers, amongst others:
- [Aave Governance v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-governance-v3/12367)
- [a.DI (Aave Delivery Infrastructure)](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-a-di-aave-delivery-infrastructure/13951)
- [Aave Robot](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-robot-v1/13091)

## The proposal
Even within the Aave <> BGD Labs engagement context, this vote tries to follow good procedures on the community and ask for pre-approval on all the ideas exposed on the previously linked posts, for them to be official.

The voting options are:

**FOR** - support the Aave Governance v3 and its dependencies

**AGAINST** - don't support Aave Governance v3 and its dependencies

492,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Back AgeOfGods (AOG) to Syrup Pool!

CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from AgeOfGods, a next-gen NFT action card game set in a world of mythology using engaging game mechanics and with play to earn elements.

#### What is Boost?

Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, the AOG-BUSD farm will go to a 1x multiple for 48 hours, then 0.5x thereafter. Don’t worry, this will only cause temporary dilution among the other farms. At the same time, there will be a new AOG Syrup Pool with 556,000 AOG tokens to be earned by staking CAKE.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn AOG tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 556,000 AOG
- **Distribution duration:** 30 days
- **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 15 Jan 22
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 14 Feb 22
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.6435 AOG

#### Max Stake per wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards.

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some Syrup pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.

#### What is AgeOfGods?

From the team: “AgeOfGods is a game developed by ex-crypto exchange executives and Juego Game studios, where you can play and earn tokens in the process. 

There are many things you can do: start or join a guild, progress through challenges, get NFT Gods and level them up, climb the arena ladder, battle other players in PVP, participate in global PVP Tournaments… all while earning AOG token rewards! AOG tokens can be used as payment in our NFT Marketplace, and also staked to earn rewards.

100% of the revenue streams will be used to buy back tokens from the market, which will then be burned, decreasing the total circulating supply.”

494,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Helio Protocol Stablecoin ($HAY) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Helio Protocol! 
Helio Protocol is an open-source liquidity protocol for borrowing and earning yield on HAY, which is a [**“destablecoin”**](https://helio.money/docs/) over-collateralized with liquid staked assets.

Users can mint HAY by depositing liquid staking BNB tokens (at the moment, $aBNBc) on the [**Helio Protocol App**](https://helio.money/app/).


#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn HAY tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 450,000 HAY
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 25 Aug 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 24 Oct  2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.2604 HAY

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

For the HAY Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a HAY-BUSD farm.  


The farm will have **1x CAKE rewards** for the first 48 hours, then **0.5x rewards** after that.
At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1100 UTC on 24 Oct 2022 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0.1x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.5x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues etc. 

#### What is “destablecoin”?

From the team: “Destablecoin is a new type of asset class within the crypto space that seeks to label a more accurate term in the current stablecoin landscape. 

**The prefix “de-” stands for decentralized** - it does not signify price volatility the way assets such as BTC experience. Destablecoins utilize decentralized, liquid staked, crypto assets only as collateral and do not aim to achieve absolute price stability with fiat-based currencies such as USD. 

While destablecoins are not fully volatile assets, it will allow for some price fluctuations as regular fiat-currencies would experience with varying reference rates and interest rate paraties as defined by the open market.”

#### What is $HAY?

From the team: “HAY is Helio Protocol’s new destablecoin. Its use cases include borrowing HAY by deposit BNB as collateral on the protocol, liquidity mining on LP DEXes, a means of payment to transfer value for goods & services.

By supplying HAY back to the protocol as liquidity provider, users can enjoy around 7% ARY return in destablecoin HAY.

Proposal to add support for MAI (aka miMatic) on Aave V3 (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche)

### Summary

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom. It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.

All accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.

There’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.

### Risk Parameters

* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain

### Specifications

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Core team at QiDao Protocol.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.

MAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.

Despite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.

MAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.

3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
Being the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.

MAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.

MAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.
* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance
* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.

5. How is the asset currently used?

* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)
* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap
* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon
* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM
* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties
* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave

6. Emission schedule

Users can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.

7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

All funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users
There is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences
The multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.
Since the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.

8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

* Market Cap: ~$250M
* 24h Volume: >$40M
* Volatility: Low
* Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose
* Maturity: Launched 5/4/21

# Proposal Motivation

We [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to facilitate the integration of Uniswap V3 on Rootstock (RSK), the first Bitcoin sidechain. Rootstock combines the security of Bitcoin and the functionality of Ethereum. This amalgam is enabled by RSK’s implementation of a merged mining architecture and an EVM-compatible execution environment. Unlike most deployments during the bear market, RSK has doubled-down on this initiative, allocating a total of $3 million for bootstrapping liquidity across various pools.

What’s more is that the [IOV Labs](https://www.iovlabs.org/) team (the research and development group behind RSK) has been closely collaborating with both [GFX Labs](https://twitter.com/labsGFX) and [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) to ensure that this deployment is completed seamlessly. They have taken all of the necessary technical steps to be eligible for finalizing this deployment. The relevant v3 contracts are now deployed on RSK (see “Deployment Details”), along with pools for trading RBTC (1:1 with $BTC), RIF, and wETH, all accessible using the [Oku Trade front-end](https://oku.trade/app/rootstock/pool/0xd2ffe51ab4e622a411abbe634832a19d919e9c55?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp). This deployment has already aggregated over [$1.1M of TVL](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp) and is seeing[ upwards of $540k in daily volume](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp) over the past two weeks. Plus, the Wormhole integration is in place to facilitate any cross-chain governance messaging. The final hurdle is to officiate this proposal through the Uniswap governance process, and recognize this as the canonical v3 deployment on RSK.

### Introducing Uniswap to the Bitcoin Space

We’ve been in contact with the IOV Labs for the past couple of months regarding this deployment. Our teams have had back and forth conversations regarding the merits and drawbacks of bringing Uniswap to a Bitcoin sidechain, which, admittedly, has limited mindshare among DeFi users across other EVM chains. Currently, there are two divergent user profiles when it comes to Bitcoin. The first is the staunch Bitcoin Maxi. This person views $BTC as the one and true cryptocurrency, with a notable preference for highly secure and isolated systems. Conversely, we have the DeFi users. Most of their activity takes place on the EVM, and their objective is financial gain using various onchain instruments–staking, liquidity provision, borrowing/lending, yield farming, perpetuals, etc. Security is important to everyone, at least idealistically speaking, but users’ actions often indicate a preference for profiteering in the face of taking a degree of risk.

However, we think that there may be a market in between these two that Uniswap–and DeFi protocols in general–could help service. It could very well be the case that users who want to conduct DeFi transactions using $BTC will do so through dapps launched on RSK. The security guarantees using the merged-mining setup make interacting with $BTC on RSK ($RBTC) more secure than using $BTC on alternative smart contract platforms. Although it may be a reaching assumption that users will have the motivation to prioritize security to such an extent, easy access to RSK via wallets like Metamask make it frictionless for users to jump between ETH and RSK. The potential concern here, however, is liquidity fragmentation. That is, unless, a certain market of users exclusively uses RSK for all things BTC.

# A Primer on Rootstock

### Bringing the EVM to Bitcoin

Launched in 2018, RSK is the first Bitcoin sidechain. Generally speaking, a sidechain is an independent blockchain that’s fettered to a parent blockchain. In this case, Bitcoin is the parent chain, while RSK is the sidechain. The sidechain extension typically features aspects that the primary chain cannot support–Ethereum folk are very familiar with functionality separation nowadays due to the multichain and modular nature of EVM-based systems. Bitcoin is naturally more isolated, with a particular focus on sustaining the so-to-speak sanctity of its chain. However, the bare bones nature of Bitcoin means that it cannot support complex applications due to limitations around programmability. So how can this system be improved? Well, Bitcoin itself ideally stays untouched. Its usage as a ledger for an incorruptible store of value is therefore preserved, but it can be complemented with a sidechain like RSK.

**RSK is an EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain**, meaning that it is Turing complete and enables developers to construct a robust ecosystem with close proximity to the Bitcoin blockchain. Specifically, the chain uses the [RSK Virtual Machine (RVM)](https://dev.rootstock.io/rsk/architecture/), which is compatible with the EVM at the op-code level. This is precisely why Uniswap, and alike Ethereum dapps, have the ability to seamlessly deploy on RSK without significant smart contract modifications. Core Ethereum infrastructure, wallets, and tooling (Hardhat, Truffle, Ether.js, Web3.js, etc) also support RSK–so devs can easily migrate to and build on RSK while a user can simply [add RSK](https://chainlist.org/chain/30) to their already running list of chains on Metamask. But a shared execution environment is not enough of a value add. That’s where we must consider RSK’s true value proposition: shared security with Bitcoin.

### Security Before All Else–Merged Mining

Unlike most other blockchains, RSK employs a consensus mechanism known as merged mining, allowing miners to simultaneously secure both Bitcoin and RSK at no extra cost. This results in RSK benefiting from the formidable security and stability touted by Bitcoin. Approximately[ 50% of the current Bitcoin hashrate is involved in securing RSK](https://stats.rsk.co/). In other words, many of the same miners that provide security to Bitcoin are also securing RSK using the same hardware and energy inputs. Some of the largest Bitcoin mining pools like Antpool, Luxor, Braiins, F2Pool, and Binance Pool, have all opted into the merged mining setup.

**What about previous failures surrounding merged mining like CoiledCoin?**
* Rootstock doesn’t implement the traditional merge-mining mechanism used by CoiledCoin–but a more modern protocol with additional security guarantees. This is explained by RSK’s Chief Scientist [here. ](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/modern-merge-mining-f294e45101a0)An in-depth analysis can be found in the Consensus section [here](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/measuring-rsk-security-d169ac03b181). The infamous CoiledCoin attack was performed by a single individual (LukeJr) who could control more than 51% of the blockchain hashrate, which is impossible on Rootstock, and was ideologically motivated because CoiledCoin competed with Bitcoin, something Rootstock does not do. On the contrary, Rootstock provides additional value to Bitcoin. Rootstock talks have been given at Bitcon [conferences](https://baltichoneybadger.com/) without opposition of any kind. The same individual that attacked CoiledCoin has a positive opinion regarding Rootstock and a neutral opinion on the sidechain’s hashrate escrows.

### Two-way Proof of Work Peg (PoWPeg)

Rootstock does not have its own token nor inflation-based incentives. The way Bitcoin and RSK are connected is via a two-way peg using $BTC. A user deposits their $BTC in the RSK bridge, which, in turn, mints the rBTC on the RSK network. Both assets will always have a 1:1 ratio, and the max amount of mintable rBTC is the same as the max BTC supply of 21M. Hence, the main asset that the entire RSK ecosystem relies on is, at the end of the day, $BTC. RSK mining rewards are paid out to miners solely through transaction fees in the form of $rBTC.

Typically, if a PoW chain relies solely on rewarding its miners with txn fees, and if that chain has low volume, it would be subject to a 51% attack. This issue, however, is subverted under a shared security system like merged mining. No matter how low the volume falls, the network will remain steady because the reliance is entirely on the security of Bitcoin. Sure, one could argue Bitcoin itself could face fragility if txn fees and incentives simultaneously become too low–however, it is an unlikely case since the adoption of $BTC is so pervasive that many large parties are incentivized to secure the system even if it's at a capital loss. Plus, innovations like [inscriptions continue to sustain momentum for Bitcoin’s usage](https://messari.io/report/bitcoin-brief-runes-grayscale-and-microstrategy?referrer=research-reports).

# Bitcoin Ecosystem Catalysts

If we analyze the previous points about the robust security and EVM compatibility of RSK, it’s clear how there may be an untapped market here for Uniswap to enter. Bitcoin, relative to the rest of the crypto market, is to a degree, isolated. The adoption of Bitcoin has been far more prominent around the world relative to other cryptocurrencies, even becoming [legal tender in countries like El Salvador](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/pdf/el-salvadors-law-a-meaningful-test-for-bitcoin.pdf). The US regulatory environment, though constrictive to most cryptocurrencies, [has been significantly more amenable to Bitcoin](https://watcher.guru/news/secs-gary-gensler-says-bitcoin-is-not-a-security).

In the past year alone, Bitcoin has taken tremendous mindshare among both investors and users. A series of BTC Spot ETF filings were released in July as [Blackrock led the pack](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/spot-bitcoin-etf/). And August saw [Grayscale secure a vital victory against the SEC](https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit), as the appeals court denied the SEC’s attempt to deny GBTC’s conversion to an ETF. On the user side, inscriptions dominated the Bitcoin landscape, bringing another creative use case to the seemingly latent chain. Although ordinal (non-fungible) & BRC-20 (fungible) inscription volume peaked earlier in the year, they have since sustained a large degree of their momentum, with [average daily inscription mints increasing by 48.1% in Q3](https://messari.io/report/state-of-bitcoin-q3-2023). The large Bitcoin fee uptrend can also be attributed the inscriptions rush.

RSK is also taking advantage of these advancing narratives. Through [RSKIP-387](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP387.md), Bitcoin ordinals and inscriptions are looking to become available on RSK using the Powpeg bridge. In terms of projects, IOV Labs is [funding](https://rootstock.io/grants/) more than 5 ordinals-based projects that came out of the HackerEarth Ideathon + Hackathon.

# Liquidity Bootstrapping

Rootstock will commit $3M Rootstock-based tokens in Uniswap-specific liquidity. The tokens will be deployed on Uniswap through the Rootstock integration with Oku, the funds will be provided by IOV Labs. They will work to deploy the funds as follows:

* 1st Phase - Deployment: up to $400k into four liquidity pools for the following:
  * $100k in RIF/RBTC
  * $100k in RIF/rUSDT
  * $100k in RBTC/rUSDT
  * $100k in RIF/wETH

* 2nd Phase - Growth: up to $1M to be distributed in the previous four liquidity pools created in the 1st Phase.
  * The amount to be added into the liquidity pools will be decided according to the trading volume growth in a period of 3 months for each pool.

* 3rd Phase - Expansion: up to $2M to be used in order to create new liquidity pools and token pairs.
  * IOV labs will create new liquidity pools according to market demand. These new liquidity pools will be a minimum amount of $100k.

The goal is to deploy the $3M within 12 months in several phases. While the proposed limit is $3M, IOV Labs may increase this amount based on the outcome and success of this initiative.

Track active pools, TVL, volume, and fee metrics via [Oku’s RSK analytics page](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp).

# Success Criteria

Overall, we propose the transparent measurement of this project’s success through the following success criteria and long-term goals:

* At least a 30% increase in TVL across all initial pools during 2024, excluding the liquidity provided by IOV Labs
* At least a 100% increase in average RSK DEX trading volume across all initial pools in the first six months after the onchain proposal
* Successful adoption of Uniswap by the Rootstock community, aiming for a >20% increase in the number of active users by end of Q1 2024
* Continuous and sustainable maintenance of the Uniswap-RSK integration contract, ensuring optimal operation and long-term security

# Deployment Details

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the below Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on RSK. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on RSK.

title: [ARFC] TokenLogic - 6 month Service Provider Proposal
author: @TokenLogic
created: 2023-09-07

---

# Summary

Following a successful [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x05636d75aae6e99be9c79a6337603f69213d34c3cf0b518842aa994f2ec790bf) this publication seeks to onboard TokenLogic as a Service Provider to Aave DAO.

# Motivation

TokenLogic has been contributing to Aave for nearly 6 months and this publication formalises our continued contribution to the Aave ecosystem by onboarding the team as a recognised Service Provider.

This funding will be used to support the TokenLogic team to deliver the scope as outlined in the [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x05636d75aae6e99be9c79a6337603f69213d34c3cf0b518842aa994f2ec790bf).

If the DAO elects to grant an overlapping scope of work to another service provider, TokenLogic will amend the GHO stream accordingly.

If other teams within the Aave ecosystem wish to make proposal on topics TokenLogic is working on, we will proactively work with the team to achieve the best outcome for Aave DAO.

# Specification

The following assets in the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO via the Aave Swap contract.

* [350,000 aethDAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x018008bfb33d285247a21d44e50697654f754e63?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)

The AIP will call the createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController interface to create a 180-day stream for 350,000 units of GHO. The following address will be the recipient of the stream:

Address: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`

This will allow the TokenLogic to periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.

501,"In an effort to better inform the crypto ecosystem on ongoing fundamental changes and major developments on Venus, Messari is proposing to write quarterly research reports. This would serve to attract more builders, entrepreneurs, and investors who would then provide value to the overall network once they are more aware of these core project fundamentals.

All reports would live as free resources on Messari and would be distributed through their newsletter (230k subscribers) and various social channels, now also including Thomson Reuter’s Refinitiv in addition to S&P Global and Bloomberg to their redistribution partners which will get the Venus Protocol reports on 3 of the largest TradFi research platforms in the world

Rationale:
Currently, there is a high barrier for those within existing project communities and the broader crypto world to stay informed and up to date with all of the major key performance indicators and protocol-level changes. While there are various analytics dashboards, blog posts, and messaging channels, it is still cumbersome to have a strong understanding of all the important happenings going on. This leads to a misallocation of resources, both time and money since there are investors, developers, and users that are not acting with the full breadth of knowledge at their disposal.

To alleviate this problem, many of the largest projects and DAOs are expending additional resources to better surface a lot of this core information. These initiatives are serving to increasingly professionalize this industry, however, what is still missing is the proper contextualization of this data from an independent third party that would allow an outsider to gain better insight into what’s going on.

Venus is proposing the commissioning and payment of Messari's services through it's already existing DAO Operation Fund, at no additional cost to XVS Holders or Venus Treasury.

502,"The Aave V3 deployment on several network mainnets is close to execution.

Cohort 1 of deployments was defined by community consensus on the main second Layers of Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks.

While Aave V3 is fully embracing the blockchain Multiverse, deployment on a network is neither cost-free nor risk-free.

To filter out proposals and provide the Aave community with needed information to form an opinion on a Network willing to Host Aave V3, a Governance Framework has been created in an effort to standardize the process.

AIP: TBD
Title: ARC - Add FOX Token (ShapeShift) as collateral
Status: Proposal
Authors: @valthedad @seven7hwave

SUMMARY

As explored in more detail below, listing FOX on Aave would provide an opportunity to earn additional fees as FOX holders collateralize their assets and increase platform liquidity. FOX is a token with a growing presence in the broader DeFi ecosystem, and is tied to an open-source platform that reduces friction and creates a better experience for crypto users.

BENEFITS FOR AAVE

Through the obvious mechanics, the addition of FOX to Aave would directly increase the platform’s usage and fees. The lending market for FOX is likely to increase over time; in addition to the aforementioned THORchain and Osmosis integrations, FOX is available on Rari Fuse. The Tokemak community also recently voted to give ShapeShift its own reactor, and in December 2021 the asset was added to Coinbase Pro. As such, it’s probable that demand for FOX in a borrowing-platform context will continue to grow in the months and years ahead.

FOX TOKEN BENEFITS

The roadmap for the ShapeShift DAO is ultimately driven by the community of FOX Token holders. Holding the token provides those holders with a number of benefits, including exposure to ShapeShift’s various value-accrual mechanisms:

- Revenue-sharing agreements with DeFi projects integrated into our platform, such as Yearn
- Revenues generated from commissions from validators operated on behalf of the DAO
- Revenues generated from allocating assets in the DAO’s treasury to DeFi strategies

Our newly-launched V2 platform is available at https://app.shapeshift.com. This version is open-source, supports multiple wallets, multiple blockchains (not limited to EVM-compatible networks), and is architected for complete decentralization.

The new ShapeShift, powered by a full open-source stack, will enable completely decentralized access to DeFi protocols across any chain. Additionally, the upcoming FOX Chain will provide backend node infrastructure for any interface that wants to be truly decentralized.

RISK MITIGATION

In July 2021 a comprehensive audit of Fox Token was undertaken by BlockchainLabs.NZ. The token’s smart contract has been live since 2019 and has a track record of bug-free interactions with the Ethereum blockchain. The token’s source code is viewable here: https://github.com/shapeshift/fox-token

**Summary:**
> We propose the introduction of an 80/20 weighted gauge for $OVN on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base with the pairing as OVN/wUSD+. This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.

**Protocol Description:**
> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.
>
> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**
> 
> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.
> 
> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been ""wrapped"" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.
> 
> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:
> 
> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)
> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)
> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)
> 
> **OVN by Overnight Finance**
> 
> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time.


**Motivation:**

> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:
> 
> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.
> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.
> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.
> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.
> 
> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.

This VIP proposes a new set of parameters for VAI based on this discussion 1.

## Summary

Increase the steepness of the interest rate curve of VAI to incentivize VAI close to $1.

## Motivation

- Harden the peg by making it expensive to borrow VAI when the VAI price is low.
- Provide a better rate for borrowers when VAI is at $1.

## Specification

Modification of this VIP:
- baseRate: 3% (from 4%)
- floatRate: 4000% (from 225%)

We provide an exemple of the implication of the changes in the forum post.

This VIP doesn’t enable VAI borrowings, this will be enabled in a following VIP contingent to having a significant healthy buffer in the VAI USDT PSM.

## Risk Analysis

- Reduction of earnings if VAI stays at $1
- Increasing the VAI borrow rate might reduce VAI borrowings and TVL

516,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal, entitled the “Exploring New Frontiers: Bring ApeCoin ($Ape) into the Mobile Gaming World,” also known as AIP-xxx brings the utilities and values of ApeCoin to thousands of new holders through its integration into the Meta Merge game – a pet collection and mobile evolution game powered by AIGC and Ultiverse.

By integrating ApeCoin into the game, $Ape becomes another in-game asset in Meta Merge for new holders and game players to enjoy gamified experiences based on real-world utility. We aim to reinforce and leverage ApeCoin and its ecosystem by creating new user experiences through the power of the game. Thus, this integration will provide an ecosystem where players can utilize APE tokens within the game, alongside the other benefits they know APE tokens for.

#### OVERALL COST

NO funds are needed from ApeCoin DAO. Meta Merge will be responsible for the cost of smart contract deployment, testing and auditing, and other fees and resources associated with AIP-xxx. We request support from the ApeCoin Community for implementing this integration and will be responsible for updating all progress.

518,"PanCakeSwap Improvement Protocol  (PIP) XXX: Integration of Privacy Enhancing protocol for PancakeSwap

Abstract:
This PcakeIP proposes the integration of privacy-enhancing technologies into the PancakeSwap decentralized exchange to improve the privacy and security of its users. The proposed technologies include Ring Signatures, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Stealth Addresses, and Coin Mixing using CoinJoin.

Motivation:
Privacy is a crucial aspect of decentralized finance, and PancakeSwap is no exception. The lack of privacy in public blockchains is a significant limitation for users who wish to keep their transactions and balances private. The implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies can help users protect their privacy and improve the overall security of PancakeSwap. Pancake Swap's current level of privacy and anonymity is limited due to its public ledger, which allows anyone to view all transactions and trace them back to their source. This has led to concerns about the privacy and security of Pancake Swap users, as well as potential regulatory pressures and censorship. To address these issues, we propose the integration of privacy-enhancing technologies, similar to what Satoshi Nakamoto foresaw in the original Bitcoin white paper.


Proposal and Technical Specifications:

We propose the direct implementation of four privacy-enhancing features in the Pancake Swap protocol:

1. CoinJoin: CoinJoin is a technique that allows multiple Pancake Swap transactions to be combined into a single transaction, making it more difficult for outside observers to determine which inputs correspond to which outputs. By joining transactions together, CoinJoin can help obfuscate the origin and destination of Pancake Swap transactions. We propose that CoinJoin be implemented directly in the Pancake Swap protocol using a new opcode.
2. zk-SNARKs: zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) are a type of zero-knowledge proof that allows for private transactions on the Pancake Swap network. Using zk-SNARKs, users can prove that they own a certain amount of Pancake Swap tokens without revealing any details about the transaction or their identity. We propose that zk-SNARKs be implemented in the Pancake Swap protocol using a new transaction format.
3. Ring Signatures: Ring signatures allow users to sign a message without revealing which user actually signed it. This can help protect the privacy and anonymity of Pancake Swap users, as it makes it more difficult for third parties to determine who is behind a particular transaction. We propose that ring signatures be implemented in the Pancake Swap protocol using a new opcode.
4. Stealth Addresses: Stealth addresses allow users to generate a new address for each transaction, making it more difficult for outside observers to track the flow of Pancake Swap tokens. This can help enhance privacy on the network, as it makes it more difficult for third parties to link transactions together. We propose the implementation of stealth addresses in the Pancake Swap protocol by following the same process outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper.

Implementation 

By implementing these privacy-enhancing features, Pancake Swap can offer its users a greater level of privacy and security while preserving the decentralized nature of the protocol. The implementation of these features would help to ensure that Pancake Swap remains a viable and competitive decentralized exchange in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. These technologies would greatly enhance the privacy and security of the PancakeSwap DEX. We recommend direct implementation into the protocol to preserve users' privacy and maintain a decentralized trustless  permissionless system the true Financial freedom envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.",neutral

**Summary:**

This is a proposal to increase the AMPL capFactor from cap2 to cap3 ($3M —> $10M) as outlined in the Balancer [whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217)

**Background:**

Ampleforth is a digital currency with an elastic supply that adjusts each day according to demand in the marketplace. The protocol effectively seeks to shift volatility from price to supply. The supply can shift dramatically over time, while the price stays within a band around the price target of the 2019 US Dollar.

Ampleforth has developed a smart pool that updates the pool weights each day in sync with the supply changes of AMPL in an effort to reduce the impermanent loss that is normally incurred by liquidity providers.

**Proposal:**

The AMPL/USDC smart pool currently has $8.8M in total liquidity. AMPL’s share of that liquidity is $6.1M which is notably over the current cap limit.

I therefore propose to increase the AMPL cap tier from cap2 ($3M) to cap3 ($10M)",neutral

**Title**: [ARFC] Amend Safety Module Emissions
**Author**: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
**Created**: 2024-02-15

---

# Summary

This publication proposes amending daily AAVE emissions across the three Safety Module (SM) categories to support GHO stability.

# Motivation

With the introduction of [stkGHO](htpps://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=7), GHO went through a positive price action and recovered the 1:1 peg. 

Since then, however, the price of GHO has been drifting. There is an additional risk of GHO being redeemed from the SM and sold in the market. There are currently around [5.2M GHO cooling off](https://dune.com/xmc2/aave-safety-module) from the stkGHO module.

To support the GHO peg and to pave the way for future GHO supply expansion, this publication proposes increasing the daily AAVE emission going to stkGHO holders. 

This publication also proposes to offset this increase in AAVE emissions by reducing the emissions directed to stkAAVE and stkBPT holders. The overall amount of AAVE per day is to remain unchanged. 

# Specification

This proposal will implement the following changes to the AAVE emissions across the three SM categories: 

| Asset | Current AAVE/Day | Proposed AAVE/Day |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stkAAVE | 385 | 360 |
| stkGHO | 50 | 100 |
| stkBPT (AAVE/wstETH) | 385 | 360 |

# Next Steps

1) Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.
2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage

## Protocol Description
CoW Protocol lets people swap assets MEV protected at the best exchange rate by leveraging its batch settlement layer built on top of DeFi’s favorite AMMs and DEX Aggregators. Instead of directly executing trades on-chain, users only sign their swap intention and delegate the execution to so-called solvers (aka relayers in other protocols). Solvers bid on the best possible exchange rate in order to win the right to settle trades. By batching multiple trades together in order to create CoWs (Coincidence of Wants), solvers can save on gas costs, AMM fees and execution risk. Therefore CoWs lead to structurally better prices than on any existing DEX aggregator. In the absence of CoWs solvers fall back to using the best possible on-chain route, by comparing quotes from leading aggregators.

## Motivation
Strengthen the COW and BAL communities ties by giving a reward in COW tokens for veBAL voters, while increasing BAL rewards to COW liquidity providers. More in CowDAO proposal [here](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-using-cow-to-boost-bal-rewards-for-cow-lps/783)

## Specification

1.  **Governance**: CowDAO is governed by COW and vCOW token holders through snapshot votes and forum proposals. 

2.  **Oracles**: No use of oracles in CoW Protocol

3.  **Audits**: Settlement contract [audits](https://github.com/gnosis/gp-v2-contracts/tree/main/audits). COW token [audits](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-token/tree/main/audits).

4.  **Centralization vectors**: Orderbook and solver competition are still hosted on a server although decentralizing this part of the stack is on the roadmap. The potential risk is mainly censorship of orders. No user funds are at custody. Limit prices are enforced by an immutable smart contract. 

5.  **Market History**: COW was made transferable on March 28th and was launched with [incentives to provide liquidity on Balancer](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-4-cow-liquidity-incentive-program/295/20) pools. CowDAO is [considering](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-using-cow-to-boost-bal-rewards-for-cow-lps/783) using the veBAL voting system to boost BAL rewards for COW pools.",bearish

TL;DR - ApeCoin DAO needs professional Marketing, PR & Communications. This charter details what an initial infrastructure could/should entail, provides foundational branding support & IP usage guidelines, and creates an environment for the majority of initiatives to spring forth from the community.

The goal of this proposal is to help establish the ApeCoin DAO Marketing and Communications Working Group. The Marketing and Communications Working Group’s mandate is to:

“Propose a consistent and compelling brand strategy and identity for the ApeCoin DAO, propose and implement comprehensive marketing and communications strategies, and help establish a strong presence through effective global communication efforts in order to onboard more users into the DAO.”

Working Groups enable a sustainable community-led infrastructure that further decentralizes the DAO, creates operational efficiency, and is flexible enough to adapt to any opportunities that may arise. The guidelines for how this Working Group will function are proposed in AIP-239.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Ankr! Ankr is a decentralized Web3 infrastructure provider, powering a network of community RPC nodes and supporting BNB Liquid Staking. Stakers can stake BNB on Ankr and get a Ankr Reward Bearing Staked BNB token (aBNBc). 

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $ANKR tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 8,000,000 ANKR
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 22 Apr 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 21 Jun 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 4.6296 ANKR

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the $ANKR Syrup Pool, we propose a aBNBc-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the boosted period if it underperforms its peers via such metrics: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc. 
 
#### What is $ANKR?

From the team: “Ankr is a decentralized blockchain infrastructure provider that operates an array of nodes globally distributed across over 50 Proof-of-Stake networks. This infrastructure helps drive the growth of the crypto economy while powering a full suite of multi-chain tools for Web3 users, such as liquid staking.

ANKR is the native utility token needed for transactions and payments for many of Ankr’s services as well as platform governance.”

#### What is $aBNBc?

From the team: “aBNBc is Ankr’s liquid staking reward bearing token. Over time, the redemption ratio grows, so 1 aBNBc > 1 BNB. aBNBc can be obtained by participating in Ankr’s [**BNB Liquid Staking**](https://www.ankr.com/earn/stake/bnb/). An overview of how Ankr’s BNB Liquid Staking works can be found [**here**](https://www.ankr.com/docs/earn/liquid-staking/bnb/overview).”

title: [ARFC] Aave Swap Upgrade
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @defiJesus & @efecarranza 
created: 2023-11-02

---

# Summary

Ths publication proposes that the Aave DAO engages TokenLogic to upgrade the Aave Swap Contract to include Limit Orders and TWAP swap functionality.

# Motivation

The intial iteration of the Aave Swap contract includes the functionality to swap one asset for another within a pre-defined variance relative to Chainlink Oracle(s). ie: Chainlink Oracle +/- 50bps slippage including gas cost. 

In recent proposals, the DAO has committed to using the Cowswap TWAP functionality to acquire AURA. This highlights a functionality gap on the Aave Swap contract. This publication proposes upgrading the swap contract to include TWAP functionality. The TWAP feature is to use the new Composable COW (Composable Conditional Orders). An example is shown below:

Alice wants to sell 12,000,000 DAI for at least 7500 WETH. She wants to do this using a TWAP, executing a part each day over a period of 30 days.

`sellToken` = DAI
`buytoken` = WETH
`receiver` = address(0)
`partSellAmount` = 12000000 / 30 = 400000 DAI
`minPartLimit` = 7500 / 30 = 250 WETH
`t0` = Nominated start time (unix epoch seconds)
`n` = 30 (number of parts)
`t` = 86400 (duration of each part, in seconds)
`span` = 0 (duration of span, in seconds, or 0 for entire interval)

If Alice also wanted to restrict the duration in which each part traded in each day, she may set span to a non-zero duration. For example, if Alice wanted to execute the TWAP, each day for 30 days, however only wanted to trade for the first 12 hours of each day, she would set span to 43200 (ie. 60 * 60 * 12). Using span allows for use cases such as weekend or week-day only trading.

Whilst integration the TWAP functionality, this publication proposes adding Limit Order functionality. The lift to do so is minimal and it offers additional functionality. Limit Orders enable the DAO to swap one asset for a minimum amount of the received asset. ie: Swap 1 ETH for a minimum 1700 USDC. 

To support the developers using the Aave Swap contract, this publication proposes creating a command-line interface (CLI) using Tenderly to verify if the swaps can be executed at prevailing market conditions. This tool serves the dual purpose of ascertaining the feasibility of a swap and help the developer to determine the appropriate slippage percentage to use.

Slippage in the context of COW Swap does not mean that it will be that number, COW Swap matches orders on a best case basis and the actual cost of the full transaction could be lower. The slippage mentioned here is a worst case scenario that takes into account both the counter-party's price as well as gas costs. Slippage as commonly known could be 0.1% and 0.9% could be gas costs depending on the network utilization at the time of the swap, assuming a 1% slippage. Even allowing for 1% slippage, once executed, the total gas costs + real slippage might end up only being 0.5%.

# Specification

## TWAP Orders

Using Composable Cow upgrade the Aave Swap contract to perform TWAP swaps.

The details on Composable Cow can be found [here](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow).

This upgrade involves adding a Payload template and tests cases.

## Limit Orders

Using the new price checker introduced by Milkman, upgrade the Aave Swap contract to perform limit order swap. 

This upgrade involves adding a Payload template and tests cases.

## Tenderly

Create a CLI tool that uses Tenderly to proactively verify the feasibility of proposed swaps.

This tool offers an approximate assessment of whether a trade with the specified parameters is attainable. It will return `true` for a swap that is likely to succeed and `false` if not likely to succeed. If not likely, then the user can check with a bigger slippage tolerance.

Could also extend it to suggest a slippage given the size of the order and market conditions. 

We want to again reiterate that because of the nature of DAO governance, once the payload is executed, conditions might have changed so we always recommend extending a bit the MAX allowed slippage to account for this.

# Funding

To facilitate the development, this publication seeks the following funding:

**Funding Amount:** $12,672.00 USD, to be paid in GHO.
**Delivery Schedule:** 5 weeks, which includes an estimated 2wk review period.

As part of our normal process, we intend to submit our work to @bgdlabs for review. We do this to ensure our work is of the highest quality.

The transfer of funds will occur with an AIP submission upon successfully completing the scope. 

The Aave DAO is encouraged to vote on one of the following three options:

1) YAE
2) NAE
3) ABSTAIN

# Next Steps

1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will commence building the contracts.
3) Upon delivering the scope, TokenLogic will submit a AIP to create an allowance or transfer for equivalent 12,672.00 USD settled in GHO.

The DAO is expected to uphold outcome of the Snapshot vote.

This proposal seeks approval to begin the Uniswap Liquidity Program v0.1 to migrate liquidity to v3. A detailed proposal on the Uniswap Liquidity Program can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-begin-uniswap-liquidity-program-v0-1/13635).

# Summary

This proposal outlines a framework for establishing a liquidity incentives program (Uniswap Liquidity Program, ULP) with the goals of: accelerating the migration of liquidity to Uniswap v3; encouraging new market participants to experiment with liquidity provision, further distributing ownership of UNI tokens, and supporting ecosystem growth over the long-term.

We propose the program start with an initial maximum budget of 1.662m UNI, to be allocated as liquidity incentives across two quarters. Continuation of the program will require an additional governance vote. Upon renewal of the program, each of the three initiatives can be broken out into separate proposals.

The program will aim to bootstrap liquidity across three different initiatives:

* Stablecoin pairs
* Mid-tail pairs (e.g DeFi governance tokens)
* Deposit receipt tokens (i.e. cTokens, aTokens)

Note that this is just the beginning of the Uniswap Liquidity Program (v0.1). We want to start simple and evaluate the program's effectiveness before we expand it. We will provide periodic updates on ULP to Uniswap governance and seek community feedback.

title: [BIP-84] Revoke Hexagon’s Friendly Fork Status
status: RFC, then proposed
author: @gerg
created: 22-07-2022

---
## Motivation
The Balancer Friendly Fork framework came about to encourage teams to deploy Balancer V2 contracts, subgraph, and a frontend for chains on which the Balancer DAO has not prioritized. The framework is meant to benefit the deploying teams with a seal of approval and the Balancer DAO with a revenue/token split. Ensuring benefits of a friendly fork should be a high priority for the DAO.

The [governance vote approving Hexagon ](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x953e2fb920fc219f3e3b474ffd4d6f47e562cff809d978f804a26fc353b34835) passed approximately seven months ago. Immediately following, [Symmetric was denied FF status ](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0xf9e44f6659b0a3a3249341bf8588b192ab923374fbca3f9be929c156036565e7) on the grounds of not yet having a product/deployment to show; Hexagon was not revoked at this time out of respect for governance’s decision. In those ~7 months since Hexagon got their FF status, they have still delivered nothing and communicated nearly nothing other than what was said in this forum thread.

## Proposal
- Revoke the Hexagon Friendly Fork existing designation, but do not bar Hexagon from re-applying when/if they have a delivered a full deployment
- Formalize the requirement that teams applying for FF status must have a functional deployment consisting of core contracts (w/ identical bytecode), subgraph, and frontend *before* applying

Core contracts include:
- Vault, (Timelock) Authorizer
- Weighted Pools
- Composable Stable Pools
- LBPs
- Linear Pools (if appropriate external protocols exist on that chain)
- Boosted Pools (if linear pools are deployed)

## Implementation
Since Friendly Forks are social agreements, no on-chain actions are required

## Specification
Again, no on-chain actions are required

Enable a Balancer gauge for the Polygon jEUR - PAR stable pool, coined 2eur (PAR).

PAR and jEUR are both crypto-backed Euros stablecoins. PAR is issued by Mimo Capital and jEUR by Jarvis Network.

Mimo Capital and Jarvis Network co-write the proposal and have already a history of incentivising together a 4eur and a 2eur (PAR) pools on Curve for more than a year. Mimo and Jarvis both want to migrate the 2eur (PAR) pool from Curve to Balancer.

# Protocol Description:

## Jarvis Network

Jarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks.

The Synthereum protocol has four modules:

* Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed.
* Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types.
* Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio.
* Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools.

Most jFIATs have a direct fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi) or indirect (Monerium, Paytrie, Transfero etc.), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Aave, Midas, 0VIX), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy).

### Mimo Capital

Mimo Protocol is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon and Fantom. The stablecoin (PAR) is decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro fiat currency.

# Motivation:

The role of the 2eur (PAR) pool is to increase the stability of PAR (1), the on-chain liquidity of both PAR and jEUR (2), and connect the Mimo and Jarvis ecosystems (3). Together, these 3 points allow for building an European DeFi ecosystem.

1. PAR peg: PAR is issued following the CDP model; if PAR trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy PAR cheaper and repay their debt; if PAR trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow PAR and sell them at a higher price; since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC and ETH back and forth at the EURUSD and computed ETH/EUR Chainlink price feed and without price impact, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and the Jarvis Liquidity Pool to help maintain the PAR peg; so if PAR trades below or above its peg, anyone can perform an arbitrage without having to go through a CDP.
2. On-chain liquidity:

* PAR: since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC and ETH without price impact, then exchanging jEUR, ETH or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap PAR to jEUR and then to USDC or ETH to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa. This considerably increases PAR liquidity.
* jEUR: jEUR main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jEUR minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers, which is vital to us; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets), and this is why we are launching this pool as well as other pools (jEUR-WETH, 2eur-bb-am-usd, etc.

3. Connect ecosystems: the 2eur pool connects Mimo and its PAR (essentially a way to borrow Euros with various collateral) to the jEUR’s ecosystem, enabling multiple use cases.

* Credit without FX risk: borrow PAR, swap for jEUR then off-ramp jEUR (Monerium, Mt Pelerin, etc.).
* Leverage short on EUR/XXX: borrow PAR, swap for jEUR, redeem for ETH or USDC, and repeat.
* DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: jEUR has an indirect 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium, and a direct fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium. This pool can help users to buy PAR with Euros or to sell PAR for Euros.

### A few notes:

* Jarvis LTD has started building positions in BAL, TETU and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same positions.
* Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools for vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL etc. (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot).
* With Mimo Labs, we have been launching the 2eur (and 4eur) pool on Curve. The 2eur pool did a volume of $4M since August 2022, with a TVL of $0.5-$1M.
* Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield.
* Finally, we will also deploy a 2eur (PAR) - bb-am-usd pool or a 2eur (PAR) - 2eur (agEUR) - 2eur (EURT) - 2eur (EURe) - bb-am-usd pool depending on what would be the best for the liquidity and risk tolerance of LPs.
* Mimo Labs has started building positions in AURA (locked as vlAURA) & BAL. Mimo Labs is currently working on a proposal for the Mimo Protocol to acquire AURA & BAL then lock them.
* Mimo Labs will provide liquidity in the 2eur pool and use 100% of the generated fees for vote incentives veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL (Mimo Labs is also working on a proposal to whitelist their multisig for Balancer’s Voting Escrow. In the case where the proposal is accepted, 100% of fees generated will be locked for $veBAL instead of be used for vote incentives)

title: [TEMP CHECK] Allocating part of GHO Revenue to Safety Incentives
author: Marc Zeller, Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
date: 2023-06-07
---

## Abstract

This TEMP CHECK proposes the introduction of a dual reward system Safety Incentives, where a portion of GHO revenue is directed to the Aave Safety Incentives, enabling stakers (StkAAVE & StkBPT) to earn both AAVE and GHO tokens.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this TEMP CHECK is to enhance the sustainability of the Aave protocol by reducing its reliance on the Ecosystem Reserve of AAVE tokens for Safety Incentives. We propose a strategic shift towards harnessing protocol economic activity to generate ""real yield"" through the introduction of GHO as an additional Safety Incentive. 

By directing part of GHO revenue to the Safety Incentives, we aim to create a dual reward system, offering stakers both AAVE and GHO tokens. While the contribution of GHO to Safety Incentives may initially be a small fraction of the total incentives, it represents a significant step towards the protocol's maturity and sustainability. 

This proposal, suggests that the governance should adjust the distribution percentage quarterly, in response to market conditions.

As the Aave protocol already generates sustainable revenue that covers service provider costs, the introduction of GHO into the Safety Incentives mix is a viable and strategic move toward diversifying Safety Incentives and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the protocol.

### Potential Implementation

While technicals details of the implementation will be discussed at a potential ARFC stage of this proposal, and current stage is meant to gauge community's general interest, here's a diagram of a possible implementation, redirecting GHO revenue from Collector contract (dao treasury) to a splitter contract controlled by governance.

![image|2000x1028](upload://beyTiZ0BzFAVqdN2btMmu855a04.png)

### Initial Parameters

We propose to set a potential ""Gho Splitter"" contract with
- 80% toward COLLECTOR contract (Aave DAO treasury)
- 20% toward REWARDS_VAULT (controlling safety incentives)

## Next Steps

- If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage for service provider feedback and implementation discussions.

**Summary:**

> This pool uses the [WeightedPoolFactory-v3 ](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xC128a9954e6c874eA3d62ce62B468bA073093F25#code)and is composed of [Agave Finance](https://agave.finance/) linear & boosted pools. The underlying tokens are GNO, USDC, USDT, and DAI. These will each be wrapped through Agave’s lending market to earn LPs additional yield. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. The gauge can be uncapped based on the contents being all large cap stable tokens and GNO (MC > 270MM at time of writing). Agave is a fork of Aave and native to the Gnosis chain making it the logical choice for boosted rewards for Balancer LPs to access on the new network.

**Protocol Description:**

> Agave, as stated, is a direct fork of Aave’s money market, this encompasses both a lending and borrowing side for users. Agave was built by 1Hive to bring Defi to what is now Gnosis Chain for lower fees to participate overall. Gnosis took over xDAI chain and will now be the core token for the network in terms of governance and validation. USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO. USDT is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Tether.

**Motivation:**

> This Agave boosted pool couples the boosted USD and GNO tokens to facilitate a strong liquidity base on Balancer with Gnosis. By deploying on Gnosis Chain, logically supporting GNO as a trading exemplifies Balancer's commitment to the chain. The boosted APR yield to this pool that will persist for users organically and kickstart a flywheel for incentives to drive liquidity depth on Gnosis Chain. By expanding to a new chain, getting boosted pools off the ground first thing sets a precedent for net positive growth for Balancer and LPs on the network.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** Find more information about MakerDAO governance [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/). USDC and USDT are centralized and don’t have governance. Gnosis' forum [here](https://forum.gnosis.io/).
2. **Oracles:** This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned.
3. **Audits:** See [here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports).
4. **Centralization vectors:** There are centralization risks with USDC, DAI, and USDT, though the market has clearly accepted those as minor for now.
5. **Market History:** See [GNO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gnosis). 
6. **Value:** We will earn the protocol fee on the underlying yield, plus trading fees. BIP-19 will incentivize TVL to continue to grow here with trading volume and this implementation will continue to draw in new volume, as well as showcase the power of these pool types.

This proposal provides accommodation at the AAA 4 Diamond Hotel ‘Wyndham Grand Clearwater Beach’.

Providing an extravaganza stay (for up to 300 $APE holders on a first-come first-served basis) by the scenic gulf shore. With crystal clear blue water and white sand beaches, this could be an annual gathering space for ApeCoin DAO members to party. This proposal gives up to 300 community members a place to stay in the AAA 4 Diamond hotel “Wyndham Grand Clearwater Beach” for hosting Apecoin and Bored Apes parties, just in case someone is seasick of the Yacht Club parties.

Ownership of ApeCoin will be verified through a digital wallet check at registration, minimum ApeCoin requirements are as follows:
* 1 $APE = entry to conference and party.
* 1000 $APE staked = 1 hotel room based on a first come first basis.
* 2 Presidential suites will be giveaways for two lucky ApeCoin holders during the event.

Location: 100 Coronado drive Clearwater Florida USA

### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Ape Hospitality Group aims to host a DAO only conference with $ape holders and partner communities under one roof focused on the DAO brand apart from Yuga Labs. There’s a huge misconception that still exist, many people hesitate to get involve with the DAO because they still think its just for BAYC holders. Such conferences without a high barrier of entry will create a more welcoming and IRL impact for all $ape holders.

Through this, people can interact with each other directly as well as various working groups, create bonds and get a wider idea of what we as Apecoin DAO are doing. Everyone (pending capacity) who holds $APE gets to experience the club parties at the hotel. We’ve seen a major fomo among every community outside Bored Apes during Apefest, even with the recent announcement. With this proposal, Ape Hospitality Group aims to make a place for all $ape holders to meet, party and hang out with fellow DAO members. This will help the DAO grow the unique number of holders, and give a sense of belongingness.

The main attraction will be Apecoin DAO panels with different Working Groups (who may opt in to participate), pop-up stalls for MBA licensees and booths.This will be an exclusive DAO conference for community members and builders to get together and interact with each other. Share alphas, create memories and build.

Key Benefits Summary
* Conference and get together for $Ape holders
* Panel discussion
* Networking with a wider $ape ecosystem
* Pop up stalls and booth for MBA products
* Party!


### OVERALL COST 
The total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $300,000 USD to be paid in $APE.

Breakdown:
* Booking: $184,000 (Rooms: $109,000 & Conference Hall: $75,000)
* Media and Entertainment: $50,000

557,"These three polls are related to GFX Labs' post, [Making Protocol Fees Operational](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/making-protocol-fees-operational/21198?u=gfxlabs).

Poll 1: Fee options for V3
Poll 2: Initial deployment chain
Poll 3: Asset to be held in the treasury

We invite all voters to express their opinions by voting on these three polls. Once the polls are closed, we'll use the polling data to propose a formal Temperate Check. 

## How do protocol fees work?
V3 sets fees on a pool-by-pool basis, with a fee of 0 as the default. The fee may be set to 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. This is interpreted as one over the specified number. For example, a 100bps fee tier pool with a parameter of 5 would be a 20% protocol share of the fee, and thus would be 20bps to the protocol and 80bps to LPs. Another example is a 30bps fee tier pool with a parameter of 10 would be a 10% protocol fee and thus would be 3bps to the protocol and 27bps to LPs.

Note that inserting a protocol fee does not increase the fees paid by users.",neutral

559,"In regards to tokenomics as we are aware their will be soon a smart contract migration in which many exchanges will have to go through after audits.

the figures should closley follow the one with Elrond ( Egld) team if we can set a hard cap on the amount of tokens for cake at 500 Million tokens issues until end of 2035 and also have a weekly implimentnation of buy back and burn but the total supply must not go below 300 million. We will see influx of new users, influx of traders, happy community which at currently time half a million people hold cake. 


I propose a total cake total of 500 million tokens
Burn purpose must not reduce size below 300 million.


benefits of this: Higher Price, new users, maybe could inflow a new mini bull cycle for the entire industry

disadvantage: Low APR, people will fomo


I been in crypto since 2015, i hope my understanding and what I see is good. I invested 40,000$ into this project and happy to hold until further aslong as the tokenomics meet this level. everyone here can be a over night millioniare if you just do this for us. 

Maybe you are greedy person or whatever, 99% are, but we hope the person who reviews this can just talk about this and think about this in the human aspect.

560,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z  The Happy Ape, an official MBA #00349, is a premium brand that aims to foster a culture of kindness, compassion and positive mental health in our future generations. This AIP would directly fund the creation of The Happy Ape children’s book and plush, nfc tags, and dapp development on ApeChain creating a unique digi-physical web3 experience for both kids and adults. I believe in the future of ApeCoin and am proudly offering a 20% gross revenue back to the dao based on the initial products sold. With the development of AIP-378 I will use ApeChain and $Ape to create innovative solutions, and integrate them into the products. Bored Labs, LLC. will take on the majority of work that is required, reducing costs needed from the dao and includes but is not limited to, e-commerce site creation [thehappyape.io](thehappyape.io), add $Ape as an accepted payment for our products, develop the majority of ApeChain dapp work, and nfc configuration. All development will be open source and will be fully audited, ideally by boring security dao or in cooperation with Horizen Labs. (edited)

What makes any of this special? Our children’s book will be one of the very first web3 books that can not only teach children and parents about the power of the blockchain, but also onboard them as well using ApeChain. The book is fully written and authored by myself. Here is a quick summary of the book below, or skip it for the juicy tech.

![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/4/4fa2a982de08cd201b68bfb210630005b085a7f8_2_500x500.jpeg)

“The Happy Ape and his friend journey on a daily adventure, gathering bananas amidst the vibrant jungle. Their routine centers around a central tree housing a precious book where their banana counts are meticulously tallied and stored. When theft of the only book shatters their dreams, The Happy Ape crafts a magical book, uniting the jungle’s apes in trust. With every ape receiving a copy of the newfound magical book, no one could lie, steal or cheat because all books have to agree. All of the ape’s lives changed for the better, The Happy Ape and his friend finally could purchase the coveted bouncy ball, playing happily ever after together.”

Such an amazing story isn’t it, how can it get any better? I plan on integrating an nfc tag into every book. Thus delivering a digi-physical experience allowing the user to scan the tag with a compatible mobile device and instantly mint a digital version of their book. This will be a seamless cost free user interaction all powered by our ApeChain (kudos Horizen Labs). In order to do all of this I plan on partnering with IYK, a premier supplier of nfc tags in the web3 space. Their mobile app will allow easy access to our digi-physical experience. This requires the development of smart contracts and a dapp on ApeChain. The development will be achieved through Bored Labs, LLC., and will be open source. I believe that open source development leads to better community adoption, security, and transparency. I have many plans for the evolution of our digi-physical experience as well. IYK allows for OTA updates, easy updates to modules introducing the user to new features like unique stories, animations and more. In addition to this experience I will also have an e-commerce site with the ability to purchase the products with $Ape.

To ensure an unforgettable and joyful experience, I have designed with meticulous attention to detail, a special Happy Ape plush, ensuring they become cherished friends for all. This plush will be approximately 15’’ in length and 6’’ wide. Many plushies are small and not even comfy. Our design ensures a warm, soft, and comfy embrace. The Happy Ape is sure to be a loving companion for so many around the world.

![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/0/04f1f686c4ab2b5611831c4589006f0963fce7cc_2_462x1000.png)

Digitizing Items
* Permanently link a 1:1 NFT to a physical Item (shown above irl test)
* Independently deploy Chips without any knowledge of code
* Schedule campaigns according to specific groups of Items
* Configure your digital experience using IYK Modules

So…“Who are you entrusting valuable DAO funds to, you may wonder, and what qualifies me for it?”

Let me start off by introducing myself. My name is Kevin, I’m 37 and I’m married with 3 kids. 8 yo girl, 6 yo boy, 2 yo girl. I’m a software architect and I’ve been in the web3 space for a few years. I have run a successful software company, Bored Labs, LLC., for 3 years now. I have bookshelves full of children’s books and bags full of plushies. The amount of time I’ve spent reading to my kids and playing with plushies is measured in years! I believe in the power of community and helping others which is why I am here. My passion to share kindness and love back into the world while helping others is what motivates me to do this. I want to provide value back to the various communities connected to apecoin and help them grow as well. I hope that through future collaborations I can work with other communities like bulls on the block and mocaverse to continue creating positive and inspirational children’s books along with animated videos. I believe this is a small stepping stone that will lead to a much larger goal of combining web3 ip use to bring people together.

I added a budget for marketing that will help ensure reach and the success of my brand. Half of the marketing budget will be given back to the buyers of my products. A simple marketing strategy i’ll rely on will be asking product buyers to post images of themselves with my products and reward them with $APE. The other half will be reserved for various marketing efforts as needed.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
 Most importantly ApeCoin DAO will be supporting and empowering our future generations through a unique onboarding digi-physical experience that will help amplify innovative solutions on ApeChain. This AIP will help promote the use and growth of ApeChain and $APE by building one of the first dapps that will help onboard many new users and introduce them to ApeCoin. The Happy Ape products aim to give more visibility to the ApeCoin community in a positive light. We will also be reaching a new audience that we haven’t explored much of. Our products support kindness, compassion, and positive mental health which is something we could all use more of.

We’re offering 20% gross revenue back to the DAO to show gratitude and continued support back to the community. (Detailed under our Overall Cost)

As a result of this proposal, IYK has promised that they would add ApeChain as a supported chain to their application.

This would allow anyone using IYK to use ApeChain as their selected chain to mint nfts on. It would help guide the development and use of digi-physical experiences on ApeChain, and directly fund code that is open source leading to better security and adoption starting within our community. We need a better way for fast adoption of ApeCoin.

I will ensure resources like artists/animators are from the ApeCoin community. With many more future books and animated videos I plan to collaborate with more ApeCoin communities. I promise to innovate new ways of incorporating ApeChain and $Ape into our future products as this is just a stepping stone for us. It’s important that we continue development around ApeChain and $APE. I would be honored to have ApeCoin DAO help us cultivate positivity into many lives of our next generation around the world.

> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Threshold)
> * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tBTC_project)

### Protocol Description:

> tBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin, that is 1:1 backed by mainnet BTC.
> 
> Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.
> 
> tBTC is trust minimised and redeemable for mainnet BTC without a centralized custodian.

## Motivation:

> This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the Balancer tBTC/WBTC pool on Ethereum.
> 
> Threshold DAO seeks to consolidate deep liquidity on Mainnet, and Balancer is an ideal venue to build upon.
> 
> The DAO has budgeted T token bribes to incentivise this tBTC/WBTC pool, with the goal to attract liquidity to the pool and Balancer. Threshold DAO intends this pool to be a part of the long-term tBTC strategy.

### Specifications:

>1. Governance:
> tBTC operates on Threshold DAO’s decentralized threshold encryption protocol. Threshold DAO is governed by the network’s work token, T. T token holders govern the DAO via proposals raised to the Threshold forum, which can be raised to a vote via Snapshot, as well as the on-chain Governor Bravo module via Boardroom.
> tBTC contract deployments are currently managed via the Council multi-sig, a 6-of-9 multi sig managed by trusted community members: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f
>In the future, all contract authorities will be passed to the Governor Bravo contract.

> 2. Oracles:
> tBTC does not rely on an oracle price feed.

>3. Audits:
>* [Least Authority](https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-keep-network-tbtc-bridge-v2/) 
>* [Chainsecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/threshold-network/)
>* [Certik](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/threshold-network)
>* [Immunefi Bug Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/)

> 4. Centralization vectors:
> Threshold Network governance is decentralized, and updates are ratified by the DAO.
> tBTC contracts updates are currently managed by the Council multi-sig.

> 5. Market History:
> tBTC is a wrapped BTC token, and is pegged to the price of BTC. Since launch, tBTC’s price has not significantly diverged from that of BTC. tBTC launched in January of 2023, and currently has ~1000 BTC to collateralize the ~1000 tBTC.
> Link to pool: [0xe4e72f872c4048925a78E1e6Fddac411C9ae348A](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4e72f872c4048925a78E1e6Fddac411C9ae348A#code)

### Value:

> The Ethereum tBTC/WBTC pool is intended to be a lynchpin of BTC liquidity on Mainnet.
> 
> Threshold DAO has allocated a portion of its incentives budget to bribe the tBTC/WBTC pool via Paladin.
> 
> Balancer will benefit by attracting additional BTC liquidity.

# tl;dr

- Cakepie is a veCAKE Manager that boosts rewards for CAKE stakers and PancakeSwap’s liquidity providers
- PancakeSquad NFT holders and point holders **(≥ 1100 points)** are eligible for the Private Sale with 10% allocation, while the remaining 90% will be open to a Public Sale
- Flat participation fee of 1% for the Public Sale, 0% Participation Fee for the Private Sale

# Proposal and cIFO Timeline

- To allow the community to learn more about the project, we have published the cIFO proposal details on the PancakeSwap Forum on 29 Dec 2023, 1530 UTC, but voting will only start 24 hours later, on 30 Dec 2023, 1530 UTC
- Between publication and the start of voting, please comment under the [**Forum Topic**](https://forum.pancakeswap.finance/t/cakepie-cifo-discussion-thread/220) if you have any questions
- If the proposal is successful, there will be an AMA on 3 Jan 2024, 1200 UTC for the community to learn more from the team

# What is Cakepie?

Cakepie is a SubDAO created by Magpie to enhance the long-term sustainability of PancakeSwap. 

As a yield and veTokenomics service provider, Cakepie's core mechanism involves locking CAKE tokens as veCAKE. This process enables Cakepie to secure enhanced yields and amplified governance power within PancakeSwap, creating opportunities for DeFi users while simultaneously reducing the circulating supply of CAKE.

# What is CKP?

CKP is the primary token issued by Cakepie which can be locked for vlCKP (Vote-Locked Cakepie) at a 1:1 ratio. 

vlCKP token has the following utilities:

- **Revenue sharing (live at TGE)**: Earn 8% fee revenue on all boosted CAKE yield of liquidity providers.
- **Governance (live at TGE)**: Take part in the governance of the Cakepie protocol
- **Earn bribes (planned for Q1)**: Vote on gauges in Cakepie’s bribe market to earn bribe rewards.
- **Control veCAKE voting power (planned for Q1)**: Vote to direct CAKE emission for PancakeSwap’s gauges.

# CKP Token Distribution
![](https://images2.imgbox.com/90/fd/QzrDERzu_o.png)

If any of the terms are unclear, please ask our friendly community, or read this article on [**vesting**](https://t.co/h2EoYCwJPs).

# cIFO Sale Details  
- **Sale start time:** ~1200 UTC on Thursday 4 Jan 2024
- **Sale end time:** ~1400 UTC on Thursday 4 Jan 2024
- **Amount to be raised:** USD $300,000 in CAKE tokens
- **Tokens to be sold:** 200,000 CKP (2% of CKP total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 CKP = $1.50 USD
- **Token Vesting Schedule:** 5% will be unlocked 6 days after the cIFO Sale end time (~1400 UTC on 10 Jan 2024), with the remaining 95% released block-by-block over 120 days.

IMPORTANT: Please note that tokens will only start trading on 10 Jan 2024, ~1400 UTC.

All CAKE raised from the CKP token sale will be given to the cIFO project. Only CAKE collected from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Public Sale and Private Sale (Both conducted via the Overflow method).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

In the “Overflow” sale method, the more funds a user commits, the more cIFO tokens they will get, and they’ll get back any unspent funds. Users can commit as much as they want to the cIFO, and their final allocation will be based on the proportion of their committed funds versus the total pool of committed funds when the cIFO Sale ends. Users will get back any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the Sale, after accounting for the participation fee.

# To participate in the cIFO:

## How to participate in the Private Sale

BOTH PancakeSquad NFT holders and point holders will get to participate in this cIFO’s private sale.

To participate in the cIFO, you can **either** 

* Set a Pancake Squad NFT as your [**Pancake Profile avatar**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/nft-profile-system/profile-guide)
OR
* Have **≥ 1100 points**

Do not have enough points to join the private sale? Don’t worry! You can grab your Pancake Squad NFT [**HERE**](https://pancakeswap.finance/nfts/collections/0x0a8901b0E25DEb55A87524f0cC164E9644020EBA) to gain access to cIFO Private Sale.

To check the number of points you have, just perform the following steps:
- Click on the wallet dropdown menu on PancakeSwap’s [**website**](https://pancakeswap.finance/)
- Go to your profile
- Check the points that you have!

To make sure that your points record is the most up-to-date, please check if you have any unclaimed tokens from previous IFO/cIFO sales. Once you have successfully claimed those tokens, your points record will be updated!


![](https://i.imgur.com/N7xnW5d.png)

## How to participate in the Public Sale

Refer to the [**IFO participation guide**](https://bit.ly/3CnhH6p).

iCAKE cannot be used to buy tokens in the cIFO, so you would need a separate amount of CAKE to commit to the cIFO.

For this cIFO, we have decided on a **1x iCAKE:veCAKE Ratio** to allow more users to participate meaningfully in the sale. In other words, for every veCAKE you have, you’re able to commit up to that amount; if you have 1,000 veCAKE, you’ll be able to commit up to 1,000 CAKE in the cIFO.

The iCAKE Ratio is a multiplier applied on a user’s veCAKE value, to arrive at the iCAKE value. Please refer to our [**Documentation**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/ifo-initial-farm-offering/icake#what-is-the-ratio-in-icake-calculation) for more details.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Private Sale ($30,000, 10% of Sale allocation)

For the Private Sale, participants are required to: 
- Own a [**Pancake Squad NFT**](https://pancakeswap.finance/nfts/collections/0x0a8901b0E25DEb55A87524f0cC164E9644020EBA), and [**set them as your Pancake Profile avatar**](https://bit.ly/3AfqnsN) **OR** have ≥ **1100** Points.

For this Private Sale, the maximum amount of funds that can be committed per user is **$200**.

The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session.


![](https://images2.imgbox.com/a6/d4/BtiPYEOH_o.png)


#### Public Sale ($270,000, 90% of Sale Allocation)

As the name suggests, the Public Sale is open to all. Your iCAKE value will determine how much funds you can commit to the Sale.


![](https://images2.imgbox.com/44/2c/f5hGd0ow_o.png)


#### **Participation Fee**

In the Public Sale, the participation fee is **1%**. This participation fee is applied on a user’s committed CAKE less the amount used to purchase the cIFO tokens, and will be burned. Hence, the more oversubscribed an cIFO is, the more CAKE tokens will be burned via the participation fee. 

In the Private Sale, there is **zero** participation fee.

Please do your own calculations and only commit funds that you are comfortable with.

# The CKP Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn CKP!

- **Total Tokens for Syrup Pool:** 10,000 CKP
- **Distribution duration:** 180 days
- **Start time:** 6 days after cIFO Sale ends, approx. 10 Jan 2024, 1400 UTC
- **Finish time:** Approx. 180 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.00192 CKP

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 14 days, then unlimited CAKE staking thereafter – the cap will enable everyone to enjoy pool rewards at a high APY.

**For the first 14 days, you need an active PancakeSwap Profile in order to stake in the cIFO Syrup Pool. No PancakeSwap Profile requirement thereafter.**

# The CKP Gauge:

CKP-BNB (0.25%) will also be whitelisted on veCAKE Gauges, in preparation for the cIFO Launch.

566,"Rationale

TrueUSD (TUSD) is the first USD-pegged stablecoin with live on-chain attestations by independent third-party institutions.

In recent years, TrueUSD (TUSD) has carved out a greater niche in the stablecoin market, increasing its market share and total market capitalization quickly. TrueUSD’s significant growth trajectory emphasizes its expanding position in the market. Especially, TUSD is a well-established and widely recognized stablecoin in the DeFi world. The liquidity of TUSD on Ethereum amounts to 389,997,401 with 51,634 holders at the moment.

In an effort to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of stablecoins, TrueUSD has taken a significant step forward by integrating Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve (PoR). This move positions TUSD as the first USD-backed stablecoin to incorporate a real-time and programmatically controlled minting system and ensures uninterrupted, on-chain verification of off-chain USD reserves.

Furthermore, TUSD has collaborated with leading accounting firm Moore Hong Kong to provide daily attestation services and reports for its reserves. MooreHK is part of Moore Global, a renowned accounting and consulting firm with over 100 years of experience.

TUSD’s enhanced transparent reserves reporting is accessible across 11 blockchain networks, including major ones like Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain and on over 70 cryptocurrency exchanges. Interested users and institutions can check TUSD’s ChainLink PoR Oracle and audit report.

Motivations

It has been a long time since TUSD was added to Venus and it performed well as a collateral. Thus, TUSD’s large user base would very much like to be able to use the Venus lending and borrow assets on ETH. Furthermore, supporting TUSD as collateral would also enhance Venus Protocol’s overall liquidity and trading volume.

Conclusion

Adding support for TUSD as collateral on Venus on ETH Mainnet would provide users with access to a wider range of investment opportunities, to the most liquidity world on Ethereum, and enhance the trading volume on the platform.",neutral

573,"# Summary

This proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard GUSD in isolation mode to the Ethereum Aave V3 Market.

# Motivation

As part of the community efforts on the V2 to V3 migration, Chaos Labs proposed a [multi-phased plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636) to promote V3 adoption. As per this plan, Chaos Labs proposes to list GUSD on Aave V3 on Ethereum. GUSD is currently listed on V2 Ethereum as a non-collateral asset.

## Liquidity and Market Cap

When analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at data from the past 180 days. The average market cap of GUSD over the past 180 days was ~$527M, and the average daily trading volume was ~$1M (CeFi & DeFi). 

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreig3i5tpyiqm7khg4n6aydyq7vbyxstf5jjbxgkmzvqmenpr2kcig4)
    

## **Liquidation Threshold**

Analyzing GUSD price volatility over the past, we observed daily annualized volatility of 5.13% and 30-day annualized volatility of 2.38%. Considering this volatility and the history of GUSD on other networks, we recommend an initial LT of 75%.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreid5fugl7ekjkzjhkqinwcacz6d3dtg4xet5lqjd3anfqus6yzyabu)
    

We recommend listing GUSD as borrowable, as we do not observe a significant risk to the protocol by allowing to borrow of GUSD, as long as it is bound by a well-defined cap.

## **Debt Ceiling**

Following [Chaos Labs’ Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440), we recommend an initial debt ceiling of $3.5M. Under the methodology for Isolation Mode, we consider two levels of probabilities for extreme price drops - Medium-High and High. We estimate the probability of an extreme price drop for GUSD as Medium-High. Given this debt ceiling, we do not identify a profitable attack vector under the current liquidity levels.

## **Supply Cap, Borrow Cap, and Liquidation Bonus**

When evaluating the initial supply caps for migrated assets from Aave V2 Market, we carefully analyze the latest supply for the asset and consider it as the demand for supplying the asset. We then ensure that this amount is aligned with the current liquidity on-chain. 

Furthermore, we take into account the debt ceiling calculated using our methodology and derive a supply cap that aligns with the debt ceiling. This approach is aimed at minimizing the risks associated with listing assets while ensuring that the supply cap is aligned with the overall liquidity of the platform and the potential risks that the asset might pose to the protocol.

Accordingly, We recommend a supply cap of 5M GUSD, and a borrow cap of 4M GUSD.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreidosn43yn65cigdxvfbcaepq7mrgnq7lqnc2feazxocchdd7go3ei)
    

Given the concentrated liquidity of GUSD we recommend a 5% Liquidation Bonus.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreibp7fbiom3mgd6oku5zozp2hwlordd57ogxl3fnivvww5hs7kstwi)
    

For the **Reserve Factor**, **Liquidation Protocol Fee**, and **Interest Rate curves**, we recommend aligning the parameters to the other stablecoins currently on Ethereum V3.

### [ARFC-Addendum]  Update Boosters & diluters for Merit Round 2

### Author:  @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

### Date: 2024-04-03

---

### **Simple Summary**

This ARFC-Addendum proposes to make booster & diluters evolve inside Merit to adapt to the DeFi ecosystem landscape evolution, introducing new diluters & removing a booster action.

## Motivation

Merit wETH has been a clear success with nearly 200k ETH, leaving other protocols to join Aave V3. 160k ETH specifically left Morpho V3 to join aave, forcing a re-balance, and has made Morpho the second largest borrower & fee payer (>11%) of wETH in Aave, forcing them to pay north of 1600 ETH to the aave DAO per year.

https://etherscan.io/token/0xeA51d7853EEFb32b6ee06b1C12E6dcCA88Be0fFE#balances

Merit GHO has also been a success and reinforced our Safety module (17M$), secondary liquidity, and peg. It allows the DAO to restart GHO minting while keeping the peg in check.

GHO is expected to provide 10% of all DAO overall revenue by next week.

However, we have to witness less collaborative behavior from some ecosystem actors. In light of this, it seems suboptimal for the Aave DAO to reward uncollaborative protocols & behaviors.

This is why we suggest stopping any subsidies to the makerDAO ecosystem; the Aave DAO has already paid millions via the AAVE and third-party LM programs and has been repaid by creating competitive forks and activating D3M in a protocol that has stolen millions of revenue from this DAO with no safety track record using a market sensible collateral.

With this proposal, a single $ in Morpho Blue or Spark will nullify any Merit Airdrop for the user.
sDAI is considered a makerDAO product, not a Spark product; holding simply sDAI or having it in Aave will not dilute a user.

This proposal aims to be enabled for Merit Round 2 and all subsequent rounds.

## Specification

### Proposed Changes:

### Conservative Option

1. Remove ""MakerDAO fren"" Boosters. for the usage of sDAI as collateral

### Aggresive Option

1. Remove ""MakerDAO fren"" Boosters. for the usage of sDAI as collateral
2. Include Morpho Blue & Spark users in the ""User of Non-Aligned Protocol"" diluter.

## Next Steps

1. If this proposal reaches a consensus on Snapshot, update the Merit reward system accordingly

This proposal is made independently by the ACI.

576,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-renew-funding-for-the-ballers/2284).

## Introduction
For those who don’t know, the Ballers are a group of long term community contributors to Balancer Protocol. This proposal will feature messages from the Ballers about their activities to give the community some context around analyzing the value of this proposal. Under the current framework the Baller program is being funded in three month increments. Our current round of funding is set to expire November 1st, 2021. Over the last few months, the program has grown significantly in member count and scope. Commensurate with this growth is an increase in the funding cost. Currently the Ballers operate with no hierarchy - it is up to each Baller to determine their level of “Ballery” (full or half or none) and their level of engagement.

I have taken the role of distributing the Ballery so I check in with each Baller every month to see what they’re up to and if they have any feedback/concerns. We’ve also adopted bi-weekly Baller Round Table meetings to better coordinate amongst ourselves. I asked each Baller to write up a bit about what they’ve been doing recently so the community has some context to frame the discussion around this proposal - note this was up to each Baller to determine if they wanted to write anything or not.

You can see the list of currently active Ballers [here](https://www.notion.so/63091677228841de9fa909139e60362f?v=a7852fc9da684a5a834934e5215edd6d). This is updated to be reflective of the next three months.

Notable changes compared to the previous three months: Tongnk is going from half Ballery to none as he’s primarily focused on grants where he’s directly compensated. Andrea, Mike B, and Xeonus are moving from half to full as the scale of their contributions have increased.

## Baller Active Roles & Contributions

Please see the forum post referenced at the top of this proposal. This section was too large to fit in the snapshot vote.

## Conclusion & Specification
With a proposed roster of thirteen active Ballers (five full, eight half) at the current rate of 500 BAL per month for full and 250 BAL per month for half with 60% fully unlocked after two years (1 year cliff, 1 year linear vesting) and 40% liquid immediately, the total cost of funding for the next three months is as follows.

1,800 BAL per month in liquid payments * 3 = 5,400 BAL
2,700 BAL per month in vested payments * 3 = 8,100 BAL

In addition, I request 300 BAL as a spending fund to reward notable community contributions and fund any small projects the Ballers might need funding for.

#### Total: 13,800 BAL

If approved, the ecosystem fund will distribute this amount to a wallet I control. The Ballers desire to re-use existing vesting contracts, so the vested amounts for each Baller would be fully released in October 2023. I will work with Mike McDonald to make a contract for any Baller who does not have an existing vesting contract with a fully vested date that matches the existing ones.",bullish

title: [BIP-XX] Reallocate wstETH/wETH Protocol Fees
author: @Llamaxyz - TokenLogic
created: 2023-06-06

---

# Summary

This publication presents the Balancer community an opportunity to bootstrap the wstETH/bb-a-wETH pool by redirecting protocol fees used for bribes from wstETH/wETH to wstETH/bb-a-wETH pool.

# Abstract

This publication proposes reallocating the bribe portion of Protocol Fees from the wstETH/wETH pool to the wstETH/bb-a-wETH pool. If the pool was fully migrated, the yield from the Aave wETH Linear Pool (bb-a-wETH) will provide the following benefits:

* Additional yield for Liquidity Providers (approx. 1.2%)
* Boost the Hidden Hand bribe flywheel (approx. 50%)
* Generate additional revenue for Balancer DAO ($0.26M)

Assuming 95% of the 32,060 wETH are deposited into Aave v3 earning 2.41%, Balancer DAO is expected to earn an additional $0.26M in additional annual revenue.

# Motivation

The wstETH/wETH pool is a ""core pool"" under BIP-19 with 50% of the pool generating yield. This means 32.5% of yield generated by this pool is then used for bribing votes on Hidden Hand. 

This publication proposes redirecting the bribe portion of the protocol fees towards the wstETH/bb-a-wETH pool. The wstETH/bb-a-wETH pool replaces the wETH with bb-a-wETH and generates additional yield and revenue for Liquidity Providers (LP) and Balancer DAO respectively. 

If 95% of the 32,060 wETH in the wstETH/wETH pool was deposited into Aave v3 via bb-a-wETH to earn [2.41%](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3), then an estimated 734.01 wETH in yield would be generated and 251.10 wETH would be directed towards bribes. The results is an approximate 50% increase in bribe funding, assuming wstETH averages 4.82% APY, and would help sustain the pool.

Separate to the additional bribe wETH flows, the Balancer DAO will generate an additional 135.21 wETH in revenue, valued at $0.26M from the wstETH/bb-a-wETH pool relative to the wstETH/wETH pool. 

# Specification

The bribe portion of the ProtocolFee from wstETH/wETH is to be redirected to bribes for wstETH/bb-a-wETH.

583,"Summary

This proposal outlines the deployment of Venus Prime on Ethereum Mainnet. The objective is to enhance user engagement and market participation through a sustainable rewards system, leveraging the protocol’s revenue to provide organic incentives.

Budget:

Total estimated budget for the first quarter: $240,000
Market Allocation:

WBTC_Core: 7%
USDC_Core: 7%
USDT_Core: 7%
WETH_LiquidStakedETH: 79%

Details

Venus Prime is an incentive program designed to enhance user engagement and market activity within the Venus Protocol. By leveraging the protocol’s revenue, Venus Prime offers sustainable rewards using tokens from the same market, to eligible $XVS holders through a unique, non-transferable Soulbound Token.

For more information about Venus Prime, please refer to the protocol documentation: https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/prime-yield 

Budget:

Estimated Initial Budget: $40,000
Initial Boost: $200,000
Total Estimated Budget for Q1: $240,000

Given that this deployment is the initial phase for Venus Prime on Ethereum Mainnet, it is crucial to offer competitive rewards to attract and incentivize users. An initial boost of $200,000 is necessary to ensure the program’s success by providing substantial rewards that will drive user participation and engagement. This strategic investment will help establish a strong foundation for Venus Prime, facilitating significant growth in supply and borrow activities similar to the results observed on the BNB Chain.

Disclaimers:

- The estimated budget considers revenues for June 14, 2024, and a reserve allocation of 20% for Prime rewards.

- The amounts will be converted if the proposal is approved, based on the allocation indicated for each market above.

- The market allocations will be adjusted based on initial results and market conditions.

Conclusion
The Venus Prime program has shown impressive performance, significantly increasing user engagement and market participation. Deploying Venus Prime on Ethereum Mainnet aims to replicate these successes, leveraging the protocol’s sustainable rewards system to drive growth and enhance user experience

https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/917

**Summary:**
Jito proposes a Balancer Gauge for a jitoSOL/wSOL and jitoSOL/stETH pool on Arbitrum, with uncapped emissions. Both pools are yield bearing and will be considered core pools.

**References/Useful links:**
Website: https://www.jito.network/
Documentation: https://www.jito.network/docs/jitosol/overview/
Twitter: https://twitter.com/jito_sol

**Protocol Description:**
Jito is the liquid staking service for Solana that distributes MEV (maximum extractable value) rewards to holders. The Jito Stake Pool enables users to stake their Solana tokens in exchange for a liquid stake pool token (JitoSOL). The JitoSOL token provides liquidity while earning a combination of staking rewards and MEV rewards.

**Motivation:**
Jito is seeking to establish a presence on EVM, utilizing Wormhole technology, with jitoSOL/wSOL and jitoSOL/wstETH pools on Arbitrum as its main liquidity sources to further enrich liquidity for jitoSOL on EVM. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Jito community.

**Specifications:**
JitoSOL can be unstaked in between two and four days. Additionally, JitoSOL-SOL is the second most liquid trading pair on Solana, with $30m in TVL as of today across 7 pools. 

**Governance:**

Jito DAO governance is managed by a Discourse forum for conversation, and a Realms interface for executing votes (the Solana equivalent of Snapshot and most popular governance platform on the chain). Links: https://gov.jito.network/ and https://forum.jito.network/ 

The Jito Network and Jito Foundation are controlled by the DAO. It has a constitution with the formal powers but basically the DAO controls all assets in Realms (revenue + JTO), JitoSOL delegation strategy and fees.

A delegation program was started in January with 17 delegates granted 12mm JTO to kickstart governance. There are regular public calls on topical issues.

The first JIP recently passed, changing the JitoSOL Stake Pool delegation parameters. Forum discussion and vote.

Jito hopes to continue increasing governance participation and several more JIPs are expected in the next month.

**Oracles:**
Pyth is the primary oracle, though there are a handful of Switchboard oracles as well.

**Audits:**
jitoSOL is built on the stake pool program developed by Solana Labs. The program has been supporting numerous implementations since the network launched and three firms have completed audits (reports).

Liquid staking non-custodial so Jito does not have access to funds deposited in jitoSOL. Even if Jito were to disappear, holders could still withdraw their SOL from validators along with accumulated rewards.

Jito does have control over validator selection and fees. Jito manages this risk by using a multi-sig operation with over 5 members of the founding team. The majority of the team needs to agree for any changes to take place. Jito will work to diversify the members over time to include other respected constituents from Solana.

**Centralization vectors:**
JitoSOL is built on the stake pool program developed by Solana Labs. The program has been supporting numerous implementations since the network launched and three firms have completed audits (reports).

Liquid staking is non-custodial so Jito DAO or contributors do not have access to funds deposited in JitoSOL. Even if Jito contributors were to disappear, holders could still withdraw their SOL from validators along with accumulated rewards.

The JitoSOL Stake Pool program is currently controlled by a multisig containing several Solana ecosystem contributors. This multisig implements the delegation strategy chosen by DAO. This will migrate to StakeNet so it’s programmatically controlled during Q2.

Jito DAO proposals can be vetoed by a Security Council of five individuals via Emergency Actions. After performing any Emergency Action, the Security Council must issue a full transparency report to explain what was done and why such Emergency Action was justified. The DAO is able to curtail or eliminate the Security Council's power to perform Emergency Actions via approval and implementation of a Jito Improvement Proposal. A handful of the current Security Council members are pseudonymous.

**Protocol Description:**
Olympus is building OHM, a community-owned, decentralized and censorship-resistant reserve currency that is asset-backed, deeply liquid and used widely across Web3.

**Motivation:**
As part of the Olympus RBS launch, the OHM-DAI-ETH pool has been equally split into two new pools, OHM-DAI & OHM-ETH as to simplify the conduction of  market operations by the Olympus Treasury under this new Range-Bound System. Since migrating the bulk its liquidity onto Balancer, the OHM pool has been one of the top pools in terms of volume generated, greatly contributing to the total revenues accruing to veBAL holders. Olympus DAO would like to explore different ways to attract additional and/or external liquidity for these two pools by enabling gauges. The gauge for the OHM-DAI-ETH pool should also be disabled as the Olympus Treasury is expecting to migrate fully out of it in the coming days.

### [TEMP CHECK] Introducing “FastPass” - A Safety Module Update 

### **Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)**

### **Date: 2024-04-16**

---

## **Summary**
This proposal introduces the concept of ""FastPass,"" allowing a portion of safety module stakers to bypass cooldown periods in exchange for a fee.

## Motivation

The Safety Module is the cornerstone of Aave protocol resilience, with users accepting the risk of being slashed during a shortfall event in exchange for safety incentives rewards and Merit airdrops. The Safety Module is crucial to Aave's reputation as a trusted DeFi platform due to its extensive risk mitigation measures.

However, extended cooldown periods (20 days) impose additional friction, making the opportunity cost of remaining in the safety module a significant concern for some users. In current market conditions, the perceived cost of this opportunity may outweigh the reward compensation, resulting in subpar attractiveness. Moreover, the illiquid nature of staked AAVE assets restricts opportunities for composability and integrations on top of the Safety Module.

FastPass enables stakers to bypass mandatory cooldown windows, offering two exit options: the existing fee-free 20-day cooldown or FastPass. We anticipate that FastPass will cater to a specific user base while contributing to increased DAO revenue for an acceptable reduction in average Safety Module coverage.

To mitigate the risk of the entire Safety Module adopting FastPass and nullifying its coverage during a shortfall event, FastPass imposes a daily churn rate determined by Aave Risk Service Providers and enforced by Risk Stewards. Additionally, FastPass can be disabled entirely by Risk Stewards during a shortfall event.

We propose implementing FastPass on StkGHO first, evaluating its success before expanding it to other Safety Module components.

## Specification

FastPass is an update to the Aave Safety Module, introducing a cooldown window bypass feature.

| Scope          | StkGHO                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| FastPass Fee    | 100bps                   |
| FastPass Churn Rate | 2.5M GHO/day         |
| FastPass Fee Collector | Aave DAO Collector     |

Detailed implementation discussions will take place during the ARFC stage of this proposal.

## Next Steps

1. Gather feedback from the community.
2. If consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, Escalate to ARFC stage.

592,"Pancake swap has just announced that more farms will have reduced rewards. Those who understand PCS understand why this is being done. To reduce CAKE emissions. However over the past several months has only resulted in those projects getting less liquidity...and ultimately fizzling out of defi. 
This hurts PCS. This hurts defi.

A DEX needs liquidity. More emphasis needs to be placed on this. People don't understand that you make money even when there are NO Cake rewards. And PCS does not educate people in that regard.

However deincentivizing pools that have taken the time to be a part of the PCS ecosystem isn't the solution. 

As I've mentioned in a previous proposal...the only solution to keeping CAKE emissions as they are, yet still incentivizing more liquidity and pools is to create a token specifically for farming. One that is designed for the future. The current CAKE tokenomics does not support more liquidity. There is less than 0.5% of BTC on PCS...which speaks to how much growth potential there is...but if the BTC/BNB pool were to get 10X more liquidity the APR would be 0.9% at current prices. Taking what little CAKE reards from smaller projects to keep supporting the main pool s does not support innovation and long-term growth. 

Create a new token that requires you to
1. Hold a minimum amount of CAKE
2. Supports 10X liquidity growth while still giving compettive rewards
3. Support higher APR in ALL pools including the longterm pool

PCS is the best in the business at creating tokenmoics with burn mechanisms etc to prevent a dilution of the new token.",bearish

598,"Checking back Pancakeswap from 2021 till now i noticed that people want higher APRs and they are willing to lock their cakes in order to earn passive income. That was the main reason this project skyrocketed then.

Since ultra sound cake project started locked cakes decreased a lot and many investors decided to leave no matter how huge achievent was this.

Recently i read that millions of cakes where moved to third party projects because pf the benefits and the rewards. 

Let's ask the community to decide what they need more:

1) More Rewards and Passive income with less deflation
2) MUCH More Rewards and Passive Income with balanced stable Total Supply. (Every week all aditional minted cakes which would be burned to create deflation will be gived to veCake shares as rewards

No matters their staking reward started last night or an year ago. This amount will be directly burnt. Before unlocking cake token they have to bear penalty. 

Advantage
In this way, we get more burning of cake token and more appreciation of cake token's price in a longer time frame

Disadvantage
ofcourse those people who got unlock before for selling purpose which means there is sudden pump and dump in shorter time frame",neutral

#### Proposal for Kitchen-Discretionary CAKE Emissions

After receiving feedback from the [**community**](https://forum.pancakeswap.finance/t/en-suggestions-for-quick-farm-launch/278), the Kitchen proposes to earmark up to **0.67%** of all CAKE emissions going to veCAKE gauges as Kitchen-discretionary emissions. 

This will allow the Kitchen to flexibly set up ad-hoc Farms for trending token pairs and capture crucial TVL and volume for PancakeSwap, thereby increasing CAKE burn for the community.
#### Rationale

With the launch of our veCAKE system, Farms are adjusted every 14 days based on the veCAKE vote allocation in the previous epoch. This makes it difficult for the Kitchen to launch ad-hoc Farms in a timely manner for trending projects, even if we were to use our Kitchen admin votes.

We also propose launching ad-hoc Farms this way instead of redirecting emissions from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ as the latter is a tedious operational process, will further increase CAKE supply, and takes ~3-4 days to fully take effect due to our smart contract design.

We have launched ad-hoc Farms in the past successfully. Examples include Binance Launchpool projects, tokens with trending narratives (e.g. BRC-20 and memecoins), etc. Some of these pairs were able to capture millions of trading volumes on their first few days of launch. 

The CAKE burned from the trading volume generated by such pairs usually heavily outweigh the CAKE emissions distributed to the Farms. This not only helps with CAKE’s deflationary momentum, but also increases PancakeSwap’s competitiveness as a premier trading venue.

#### Discretionary CAKE Emission Details

Currently, there is ~0.996 CAKE/block channeled towards veCAKE gauges. We propose to earmark up to 0.67% of it as Kitchen-discretionary emissions, which is **~0.00667 CAKE/block**. We will keep it at 0.67% even if the CAKE emission rate towards veCAKE gauges changes.

For clarity, the 0.67% will be deemed as an upper limit, and we don’t foresee hitting the cap anytime soon. This upper limit should be able to sustain ~3 ad-hoc Farms at any given time - this is not our target, but rather a buffer in case there are many trending tokens we wish to capture volumes for. 

If there are no ad-hoc Farms, the 0.67% veCAKE emission will continue to go towards all other Farms. Only when an ad-hoc Farm is established will (a portion of) the discretionary emissions be used.

Farms that are set up using these Kitchen-discretionary emissions will be short-term in nature, to capture TVL and volume when the community interest in those tokens is at its peak. If the tokens do not perform well, we will be quick to stop the Farms.

Regardless, we will gradually tune down CAKE emission to these Farms to let organic TVL and volumes take over, or transition towards the project team incentivizing liquidity on their own via our veCAKE system.

#### Implementation

Once this vote proposal passes, the Kitchen will have the discretion to set up and stop ad-hoc Farms using the earmarked CAKE emissions detailed in this proposal. We will include these adjustments and their performance in our fortnightly Epoch Reports on the [**PancakeSwap Forum**](https://forum.pancakeswap.finance/c/gauges/6).",neutral

602,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Axelar ($AXL) to Syrup Pool Again!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Axelar! 

Axelar is a cross-chain communication protocol built on proof-of-stake consensus. It allows users to send tokens across connected chains, and developers building on one chain to call any function on any other connected chain.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn AXL tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 89,400 AXL
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 0830 UTC on 12 Jun 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 0830 UTC on 11 Aug 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.05173 AXL

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours of the Syrup Pool.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the AXL Syrup Pool, we’ll be upgrading the axlUSDC-USDT (Stableswap) farm and the AXL-USDT (0.25% fee tier) v3 farm on BNB Chain.  


The axlUSDC-USDT farm will have 3.7x CAKE rewards while the AXL-USDT farm will have 3.3x CAKE rewards for the entire 60 days. During and at the end of the 60-day period – approx. 0830 UTC on 11 Aug 2023 – the farms will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $AXL?

From the team: “Axelar Network uses proof-of-stake consensus. Token holders can stake the AXL token with validators and receive rewards. AXL is a governance token, allowing stakers to govern parameter changes and protocol upgrades.

For cross-chain transactions, AXL is used to pay network transaction fees. However, users only need to pay gas using the source-chain token. The protocol will convert the source-chain tokens into AXL and destination-chain tokens smoothly in the back-end.

AXL token is inflationary as staking rewards increase the total supply — but there is potential to become deflationary via a token burn mechanism, if the transaction fees collected exceed the total network processing cost.”

605,"#### Upgrade of Meta Apes’ Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift Meta Apes’ Farm rewards from the current PEEL-BUSD v2 LP to the new PEEL-BUSD v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the PEEL-BUSD v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the PEEL token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current PEEL price.)

To ensure a smooth transition between v2 and v3 pairs, there will be an overlap of one day where there will be incentives directed towards both farms. This will occur on 4 May 2023. 

After **0730 UTC on 4 May 2023**, only the v3 pair will receive incentives, so users are encouraged to migrate in advance of this time.

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new Farm will have doubled emissions for the first 7 days. For example, if the v2 farm emits 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will emit 20 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 10 CAKE per day thereafter.

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake PEEL-**BUSD** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.2x multiplier
- **9 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.25% fee tier):
- Stake PEEL-**BUSD** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.5x multiplier (1x multiplier for the first 7 days)
- 18 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and **9 CAKE per day** thereafter 

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 0.5x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### Key timelines

* **Launch of PEEL-BUSD v3 farm:** Approx. 0730 UTC on 4 May 2023
* **Sunset of PEEL-BUSD v2 farm:** Approx. 0730 UTC on 5 May 2023

#### How to migrate?

Please remember to shift your LP to the new farm before the v2 farm sunsets.

Please refer to the following [**link**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/code/v3-migration/how-to-migrate) for migration instructions

606,"**Summary:**

> This pool uses the composable stable pool factory and contains two unique staked ethereum tokens, coinbase staked ETH (cbETH) and wrapped staked eth from Lido. 
Staked ethereum expansion has been a strategy for the Balancer protocol due to the yield bearing benefits and supporting as many ""flavors"" of staked ETH as possible is the logical step. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.

**Protocol Description:**

> cbETH is a Coinbase's staked ETH token, wstETH is a wrapped staked ETH token for Lido.

**Motivation:**

> Balancer is clearly pushing forward on all networks with staked assets as a key focus. By diversifying the staked assets Balancer opens up the door to liquidity providers to gain exposure to multiple providers, while facilitating trade routes for these assets. The protocol benefits greatly from yield bearing assets, and Balancer’s users do just as much. This pool will be a unique and diverse group of Ethereum assets making it exciting for everyone involved.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** [cbETH](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth/whitepaper) whitepaper linked as governance is not applicapable, [wstETH](https://research.lido.fi/).
2. **Oracles:** See each rate provider contract linked here respectively [cbETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7311e4bb8a72e7b300c5b8bde4de6cdaa822a5b1#code) , [wstETH ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768), 
3. **Audits:** See [cbETH](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/coinbase-liquid-staking-token-audit/) , [wstETH](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits).
4. **Centralization vectors:** cbETH is from Coinbase and therefore inherently has centralization risks, read the custodial risk section of the whitepaper [here](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth/whitepaper). For Lido and wstETH please read [here ](https://lido.fi/faq). 
5. **Market History:** See [cbETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/coinbase-wrapped-staked-eth) , [wstETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth)
6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on all assets in the pool and so will LPs. The BIP-19 flywheel will incentivize TVL to grow here with trading volume and our staked ethereum pillars will continue to have Balancer as their ideal liquidity destination.

**Title**: *[ARFC] BGD. Security budget request - December 2023*

**Author**: *BGD Labs (@bgdlabs)*

**Date**: *2023-12-8*

---

## Summary
Request for a budget of $121’200 for 2 security review procedures on Aave, together with a refund of $30’000 to BGD for the Aave Governance v3 extra voting tokens audit.A


**Amounting a grand total of $151'200**.


## Motivation
Part of [our scope Aave <> BGD Phase II](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-bored-ghosts-developing-phase-2/14484#scope-6) is the planning, engagement, and coordination with security partners of the DAO.

During the previous year and a half, Aave was in a pretty intensive delivery phase (Aave v3 improvements, GHO, Aave Governance v3, a.DI), and we thought it was appropriate to have continuous engagement with 2 security firms like Certora and SigmaPrime.

Even if this worked well, and [we still think that Certora should stay with a continuous engagement](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-continuous-security-proposal-aave-certora/15732/4), we also think that there is room for optimisation, and it is a good idea to do more ad-hoc requests for the security budget, depending on the needs.

This ARFC is an initial request, for budget required in the short term on item part of our development services scope, together with another more general we consider pretty important.

## Specification
This request has 3 components, which we want to explain to the community:

---

**1. Compensation for Mixbytes review of Governance v3 tokens**

During the activation of Aave Governance v3 on October 17th, we detected a problem with the voting assets, which required the cancellation of the proposal, the development of a fix, and re-apply security procedures.

Given that it was already audited code, we also decided to do an extra security review by another security firm, Mixbytes.

For the sake of speed and reducing bureaucratic blockers, **BGD paid for the cost of said security review of $30’000, and now we will include on this proposal a refund request for that amount**.

---

**2. Compensation for security review on a feature of Aave 3.1**

Also part of our Phase 2 scope is to do a series of improvements to Aave v3, in order to reach a 3.1 version, from the current 3.0.2.

Generally, we are confident with Certora reviewing all the planned items until now, but there is one exception (an specific feature) to which we thought an extra review was required, and we engaged Emanuele Ricci (@StErMi), a top-level security researcher with knowledge of Aave to do it.
We will be publishing soon everything to be included into v3.1.

Same as with Mixbytes, BGD has paid the cost of said security review of $12’000, and now we include the refund request on this proposal.

---

**3. Engagement with Spearbit for Aave v3 ad-hoc review**

Aave v2/v3 is a production system with billions of dollars in size, and one of the most evaluated protocols security-wise.
However, security is a continuous process, and always worth it to improve whenever it feels necessary.

During the last 1-2 months, we have noticed different security exploits in the space following similar patterns. None of them affected Aave, but apart from our continuous analysis of the system security-wise, we think it is necessary to do an extra round of review in critical parts of Aave, for additional assurance.

We have coordinated an engagement for this review scope with Spearbit, one of the leading security firms in the space, that will involve 3 of their top researchers checking in-depth different components that we identify as critical on Aave.

This engagement is scheduled to start in the second part of December, and different from the others, the payment requested in the proposal will be direct to Spearbit, for an amount of $109’200.

---

From a technical perspective:
- The proposal will send $42'000 to BGD as compensation for the expenses of part 1) and 2).
- $109'200 will be sent to a Spearbit wallet, to compensate for the services to be provided on part 3).

*The final addresses and stablecoins of the treasury to use will be included in the AIP stage, previous coordination about the last with contributors to the financial area of the Aave DAO*",bullish
608,"Cake can increase its exposure to investors by goong cross-chain. This entsils two things: 1. make the pancakeswap protocol available on other chains (such as polygon, Ethereum, avalanche, etc), and 2.having the CAKE token available for purchase in other chains. 

This is a proposal to make this happen. It should be noted that the BNB Chain protocol would still be the only one with continuous management and development and the only one with incentivized liquidity offerings. The cross chain Pancakeswap is simply a tool to earn more trading fees and create awareness for the CAKE token and its ecosystem. 

I also propose thn initial seed of protocol-ownedl iquidity pools for CAKE in each the new chains it expands into. This",bullish

Beyond the SWAMP aims to produce a vibrant, high-quality collectible bimonthly magazine claimed through the sale of accompanying NFTs displaying each issue’s cover art—similar to Punks comic but with varying rarity and added rewards. Aside from columns featuring news and difference makers from outside of our ecosystem, content will focus on the ApeCoinDAO, ApeCoinDAO-led initiatives, successful ApeCoinDAO AIPs, and ApeCoin use cases; Yuga Labs and the growing number of projects under their umbrella; brands utilizing holder IP; diversity within regional meetup groups; female collectors; augmented reality through a sponsorship with [Art House](https://www.arthouse.ar/); gaming; art, tech and blockchain. All primary sales will be conducted in APE, contributors will be paid in APE and any future revenue raised from in-magazine advertising will be received in APE.

Our mission is to create an onramp into the ApeCoin and Yuga Labs ecosystems while strengthening ties between existing communities. We will take an ethical approach to journalism, provide culture-driven meaningful content, and act as a springboard for existing and up-and-coming artists. Our team is made up by a creative director with a history in bookmaking alongside a team of illustrators and graphic designers.

We also want to further-facilitate artists by providing interview space and fair compensation for cover art. Additional features include spotlights on active community members; regional BAYC groups like Bored Club Canada, TaiwanDAO, FrenchApeYC and associations like PinkDAO; women in the space; Blender tips and tech talk; metaverse; memes; music and photography; generative artwork; Meebin with the Meebits; Mutants are INSANE; Mutant Cartel and the Mutant Hounds; Cryptopunks and Cryptopunks history; 10ktf; interviews; features on ApeCoinDAO Special Council members and Stewards; discussions with founders; security tips; advertisements from brands utilizing holder IP (ApeWater, ForeverApes etc); gaming; as well as articles written by contributors sourced from projects like Nouns, Doodles, Gutter Cat Gang, Moonbirds, CloneX, and Deadfellaz. We will also be including advanced in-magazine AR capabilities to bring artwork, advertising and otherwise static NFTs to life triggered by QR codes.

Also important to note that as marketing in the NFT space shifts away from macro influencers we believe that providing community-driven content packaged in a collectible physical form will initiate broader trust from outsiders and better prepare them for onboarding. It should also be said that for some collectors, tangible products often feel longer lasting or more real than digital; particularly to those just entering the space. That being said many others prefer tokens, so keeping those community members in mind we want to include additional NFT packs based on Beyond the SWAMP NFT rarity.

Beyond the SWAMP is seeking a one-time grant for company development and first issue production. The layout of our magazine will be completed by a team of career creatives specializing in layout, illustration and graphic design. Beginning with an initial rollout of 350 copies, we will create an economy of scale increasing to 500 copies for our second issue and 750 copies from issues three to six totalling 3850 magazines in our first year at an average production cost of $13.63 per copy. Taking this approach will allow us to grow our readership cautiously during tumultuous market conditions while lowering the overall grant request and cost to the community. External services and service providers include advisors, legal, website builders, smart contract developer, audit team, printing and promotion.

611,"## Summary
Proposal to get approval from the Aave community to adjust the governance requirements (proposition power, quorum vote differential) for Level 2 proposals, affecting the most critical components of the Aave ecosystem.
This is highly recommended from the BGD point of view, as those requirements were defined back in the days when the AAVE fragmentation was different, and because this could create an artificial and self-imposed bottleneck to pass proposals which should not really have opposition, given their technical nature.

Authors: StaFi Contributors

**Summary:**

>StaFi proposes the creation of a Balancer gauge for a rETH-ETH pool on Arbitrum, with a 10% emissions cap. This pool will be enrolled as a core pool as well due to the yield bearing token it contains. 

**Protocol Description:**

> StaFi is a liquid staked derivatives protocol launched in Q3 2020, with a focus on bringing liquidity to staked assets on Ethereum and other Proof of Stake chains such as Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot. Since launch, the protocol has accrued over $36,000,000 worth of staked assets across 11 tokens, with 3,439 active validators.

> Similar to other LSD protocols, StaFi issues a liquid receipt token (rETH) representing your share of ether staked on the Beacon Chain via a permissionless validator set. Deposits are partially covered by validator deposits. The exchange rate between rETH/ETH will gradually increase as staking rewards accumulate, though rETH is not redeemable for the ether principal and rewards until after the Shanghai upgrade.

> StaFi has a native governance token with the ticker “FIS”. FIS is freely tradable on a number of centralized exchanges, alongside some decentralized exchanges not inclusive of Balancer. FIS has governance utility and can be staked by validators in the StaFi consensus network.

**Motivation:**

>StaFi currently has an existing[ rETH-ETH pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xb08885e6026bab4333a80024ec25a1a3e1ff2b8a000200000000000000000445) on Balancer on Mainnet which has seen healthy growth.

> StaFi is looking to expand the availability and liquidity of its staked derivatives, starting with rETH, through Balancer on Arbitrum. Ahead of and after the Shanghai Ethereum hard fork, liquidity and yield on LSDs will be a key competing factor as LSD protocols seek integrations and a broader base of holders.

>StaFi is committed to driving value to the veBAL and vlAURA ecosystem by incentivizing pool liquidity via Hidden Hand voting incentives. Deeper liquidity should lead to increased volume and revenue accrual.

**Specifications:**

> Governance: [DAO forum](https://commonwealth.im/stafi)
> 
> Oracles: Direct Balance Query: The rETH rateProvider has a getRate() function that calls rETH’s own getExchangeRate() function. See the contract [here](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/rtoken-contracts/blob/main/contracts/balancer-metastable-rate-providers/RETHRateProvider.sol)
> 
> Audits: [StaFi rToken App Audits](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/stafi-bootstrap/tree/master/audits)

> Centralization Vectors:StaFi’s rebalancing is done by a bot that is run by the foundation. Presently the bot is not profitable to run, so we would not expect anyone else to run it. However, there is no chance of money being inaccessible as a result of the bot stopping–Just that the bridge would run less efficiently.
> 
> Market History: rETH has been a tradable asset since March 2021. Trading has primarily taken place in the aforementioned rETH-ETH pool on Curve. FIS is a liquid asset traded both on top centralized exchanges as well as decentralized exchanges.
> 
> Value: StaFi will make its Balancer rETH-ETH pool a primary source of liquidity for rETH on Arbitrum. By bolstering liquidity of the pool, Balancer should gain from increased trading fees.

The idea is, reward with some progressive percentage to someone who holds CAKE and provide liquidity for pools or farm.

Who holds CAKE gets rewarded with extra percentage on the profit of the liquidity pools.

Here we add value and usage for the coin and a exponencial percentage to who make the liquidity and holds CAKE at same time.

The increase of the demand will appear just in the beginning of this idea, and forces market makers to holds the coin for more profit in the swap of the liquidity pools. 

This will generate something really useful for the token.

Gauntlet and Chaos Labs propose to freeze and set LTV to 0 for BAL on Aave v3 Polygon. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-recommendation-to-freeze-and-set-ltv-to-0-on-low-cap-aave-v3-polygon-collateral-assets/16311).


## Motivation
We recommend freezing and setting LTV to 0 for BAL on Aave v3 Polygon because it contributes minimally to the protocol’s reserve growth, compared to the risk it adds to the protocol.


## Specification

Freeze and set LTV to 0 for BAL on Aave v3 Polygon.

618,"#### ABSTRACT

This project proposes the development of a Discord bot dedicated to real-time tracking of ApeCoin prices. In addition to providing information on the current price, daily, monthly, and annual percentage changes, trading volume, market capitalization, and changes from the all-time high price, the bot is also capable of generating comparative charts between ApeCoin and Ethereum over a seven-day period.


####  BENEFITS TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:

A bot on Discord that displays the prices of APE coin, and creates comparative charts with other currencies can bring various benefits to Ape coin community. Here are some of the potential benefits:
* Immediate access to information: With a bot, we won’t need to leave Discord or open another tab to check APE coin price. You’ll have access to this information directly on Discord, which makes real-time price monitoring more convenient.
* Useful visual comparisons: Comparison charts can help visualize APE coin performance with Ethereum more effectively than just numbers. This can help in making investment decisions.
* Updated and reliable information: In a volatile market like cryptocurrency, having the most recent information can be crucial for investment decision-making. With a bot, we can be sure that you are getting the Updated and reliable (because the data comes from the API provided by coingecko) information possible.
* Efficiency: Having all this information in one place, and easily accessible, can significantly increase the efficiency of your trading or investment analysis.
* Community: The bot can be a valuable resource for your community, offering additional value to your members and encouraging more interaction.

####  OVERALL COST

this bot has no costs because it is hosted on a free version of the squarecloud server, it is enough to meet your needs

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Acquire AURA 
author: @TokenLogic & @MarcZeller (ACI)
created: 2023-08-29

---

# Summary

This publication proposes Aave DAO acquire 443,674 AURA from Olympus DAO for 420,159.28 units of DAI.

# Motivation

Over the next few months the veBAL and vlAURA being used to support GHO pools will reduce as voters shift there focus away from GHO. The initial commit from the Aura Finance team was 400,000 units of vlAURA for an initial 3 month duration.

This proposal seeks to replace the support from Aura Finance by acquiring 443,674 units of AURA from Olympus DAO. Olympus DAO is reducing there AURA exposure due to change in the Olympus DAO roadmap which is detailed [here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3756-towards-a-fully-autonomous-olympus) and [her](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3967-tap29-aura-solicitation-to-bid).

Based upon the research presented in this [Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682), which details impact AIP-42 by Aura Finance, the most efficient way for Aave DAO to bootstrap GHO is via vlAURA relative to veBAL. 

Olympus DAO seeks payment in DAI, at an exchange rate of 0.9470 DAI per unit of AURA. The amount of AURA is 443,674 with a total cost to Aave DAO of 420,159.28 units of DAI. Aave DAO currently holds [2.873M](https://etherscan.io/token/0x028171bca77440897b824ca71d1c56cac55b68a3?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) units of aDAI on Aave v2.

**Olympus DAO is conducting an open forum auction over 3 day period, bids are placed relative to the spot price derived from the AURA/wETH pool on Balancer v2.

The USD price will be updated within this proposal progressively over the bidding period. Do note, Aave DAO's governance process duration exceeds that of Olympus DAO's which means Aave DAO's voting occurs afterwards and ultimately determines if/when the OTC swap will occur**

# Specification

This proposal will achieve the following:

* Redeem 420,159.28 units aDAI from Aave v2
* Exchange 420,159.28 units of DAI for 443,674 units of AURA with Olympus DAO

For reference, Olympus DAO AURA Holding Address: `0x245cc372C84B3645Bf0Ffe6538620B04a217988B`

The contract shall be developed in collaboration with @MarcZeller and deployed by the ACI team.

- Overview
- Motivation
- About Gnosis Chain
- Benefits to Uniswap
- Cost and Timeline
- Stakeholders

### Overview
Gnosis Chain is a community-owned, EVM-compatible network operated by a diverse set of 200k+ validators around the world. In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.

Since Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem.

This proposal requests a retroactive Onboarding Package for Gnosis Chain.

### Motivation
While already deployed on Gnosis Chain, Uniswap is not currently capitalizing on it. This proposal aims to change that.

One of the key areas of focus suggested by the Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee to expand the Uniswap ecosystem is “Uniswap Revitalization and Growth”. In their recent work, a large emphasis is on revisiting some of the old deployments and proactively capturing first-mover advantage on promising new chains.

As Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth across Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we believe the chain aligns perfectly with the scope of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth initiative. Uniswap’s deployment on Gnosis Chain was completed in early 2022, hence Gnosis Chain was never a beneficiary of the “Onboarding Package” that is now included as a standard element of deployment proposals.

We believe there are synergies between Uniswap and Gnosis Chain as well as a strong potential for Gnosis Chain to generate high volumes and mobilize an influx of new users to Uniswap because of its focus on payments and financial tools.

As a comparison, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).

We believe that additional visibility and an incentive program would enable both Uniswap and Gnosis Chain to tap into their synergies resulting in positive growth on both ends.

### About Gnosis Chain
Gnosis Chain is a community-owned, EVM-compatible network operated by a diverse set of 200k+ validators around the world. It features fast transaction times (5 seconds) and low transaction fees (500 tx for $0.01) with the unique advantage of having a stable token as a base asset for transactions and gas fees.

One of the first Ethereum sidechains, Gnosis Chain’s core values are resilience and credible neutrality. By allowing contributors to easily run a node, Gnosis Chain created a community-owned, anti-fragile network secured by a geographically diverse validator set. Its strong culture of at-home stakers (not reliant on cloud providers or data centres) and its community governance ensure Gnosis Chain remains credibly neutral at a lower price point than Mainnet.

Gnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralised financial tools accessible and usable for all. The collective features established blue chip projects like Safe as well as prominent ones like Gnosis Pay and Monerium.

In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.

### Benefits to Uniswap
The [Multichain Uniswap](https://blog.uniswap.org/multichain-uniswap) approach has proven successful with approx. [35% of trading volumes](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/uniswap) in the last 6 months come from non-Ethereum-Mainnet deployments.

Since Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem. The potential for Uniswap to capture the inflow of new and existing users leveraging Gnosis Chain as a payments infrastructure is a promising opportunity for the project to reach a new audience.

Gnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects, building synergic services to Uniswap. Among those, Safe and Gnosis Pay. Safe Smart Accounts count 9.1 Million accounts deployed with $100B+ in total assets stored and VIP individuals (e.g. Vitalik) using them. Gnosis Pay is the world’s first on-chain spending account with a Visa Debit Card linked to a self-custodial blockchain wallet, connected with 80 Million merchants worldwide. Roll-out in Europe and the United Kingdom has already started, with upcoming new Countries including Brazil and Argentina. That is a combined population of approx. 1.45 Billion people.

Additionally, Gnosis Chain powers a growing DeFi sector with numerous blue chip projects added since Q4 2023. These include Aave, whose market on Gnosis Chain has grown rapidly since its launch 7 months ago and is now larger than the lending protocol’s markets on Base and Scroll (as of May 2024). sDAI (MakerDAO’s interest-earning DAI) accumulated over $68 Million TVL since October 2023. Focusing on the on-chain trading vertical, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). This means, Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).

Based on the above and observing Uniswap’s performance across blockchains, we anticipate the protocol will replicate its success in capturing market share on Gnosis Chain.

### Bridges
Gnosis Chain is committed to providing easy and secure access to Ethereum L1 and other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. For this reason, multiple bridging options are available to connect with Gnosis Chain.

The [Omnibridge](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/omnibridge) is a native token bridge that connects Ethereum and Gnosis Chain (and vice-versa) by minting the canonical representation of bridged assets on Gnosis. The Omnibridge is built on top of the [Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB)](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/amb-bridge), a key bridge primitive that is used inside higher-order bridges like the Omnibridge and allows Gnosis contracts to send data and trigger contract functions on Ethereum and vice-versa. Therefore, the Omnibridge relies on the same trust models and group of [Trusted Bridge Validators](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/management/validators#amb--omnibridge) as the AMB. Part of these validators is Succinct Lab’s zkSNARK-enabled Light Client, Telepathy. Telepathy is a key component of the AMB bridge ecosystem as it enhances security and reliability for cross-chain transactions by providing validity proofs via zkSNARKs that ensure trustless verification of transaction events across chains.

The [xDAI bridge](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/xdai-bridge) is a native DAI bridge from Ethereum that is used to mint and burn xDAI, the native asset used for gas and transaction fees on Gnosis.

Gnosis has a long-term roadmap to move towards trustless bridges and is investing resources into trust-minimization of its bridges, to ensure trust and safety of users. [Hashi](https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi) is an EVM Hash Oracle Aggregator designed to enhance cross-chain bridge security by aggregating block headers from various sources. It supports 15+ General Message Passing bridges and ZK light clients, promoting redundancy and reducing reliance on single mechanisms. By requiring validation from multiple independent mechanisms, Hashi ensures greater resilience against security incidents. Gnosis plans to [gradually migrate](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-93-should-gnosisdao-support-the-integration-of-hashi-within-gnosis-chains-canonical-bridges/8245) its canonical bridges to Hashi’s distributed trust model with the goal of strengthening security, decentralisation and interoperability.

Additionally, Gnosis Chain is supported within independent bridge solutions that enable the cross-chain connection with other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. These include Jumper (provided by Li.Fi), Bungee, Hop, Connext, DLN (debridge), LayerZero, Chainlink CCIP and Wormhole.

623,"# Motivation

You may not have noticed but we are in the midst of a significant bear market for the price of BAL. This fact combined with the desire to expand the number of contributors in the Balancer ecosystem has led the Treasury subDAO to explore ways to bolster the DAO’s stablecoin reserves. One possibility is through the use of a Ribbon Finance treasury vault for BAL.

The DAO would deposit BAL into this vault and sell monthly calls - two quotes provided by Ribbon are as follows:

* Using a strike 25% out of the money, we can expect 3.17% yield per month -> 38% APY
* Using a strike 50% out of the money, we can expect 0.91% yield per month -> 10.92% APY

Ribbon vaults operate using [cash settled](https://optionalpha.com/lessons/physical-vs-cash-settlement-options#:~:text=Physically%20settled%20options%20are%20contracts,at%20the%20time%20of%20expiration.) options rather than physical settlement. This means in the event of the option expiring in the money the vault would transfer the cash value of the option (denominated in BAL) to the market maker. Effectively if the price of BAL goes up significantly during the month we will incur a loss then continue as normal and sell the next month’s call option. In comparison, physical settlement would mean we are obligated to sell all of our BAL at the strike price (minus slippage) if the option expires in the money.

Ribbon has signaled they are prepared to support cash or physical settlement - in both cases any BAL transferred to market makers in the event of a call option expiring in the money would be market sold. This is why slippage is taken into account when the market makers will quote us the price for the physical settlement option.

The exact amount of BAL to use for this is up for discussion. 500k BAL has been discussed but we could go as low as 250k BAL. The collected premium would be in USDC and would be available to withdraw from our vault every month.

Assuming we deposit 500k BAL, that represents around 12% of the BAL in the treasury valued at ~$4M ($8 BAL). A 38% APY would lead to a gain of ~$1.5M and 10.92% APY to a gain of ~$436k.

# Risks

* The Ribbon Vault is exploited and we lose our entire deposit
  * [Nexus Mutual offers insurance](https://app.nexusmutual.io/cover/buy/get-quote?address=0x25751853Eab4D0eB3652B5eB6ecB102A2789644B) on Ribbon Vaults which does cover their treasury products. This is an option the community can consider. For reference, the cost is 50.79 ETH for 1955 ETH worth of coverage for one year. 
* The price of BAL rises significantly during the month
  * We will incur a loss if we use cash settled options. Assuming we sell calls 25% out of the money: +50% at expiration -> ~9.7% loss. +100%, ~32% loss.

# Specification

If this vote passes, the DAO will allocate 500k BAL to sell monthly calls 25% out of the money with cash settlement. The DAO Multisig would transfer 500k BAL to the Ribbon Vault. The address of that vault would be independently confirmed via at least two sources.",bullish
624,"Symmetric as the official friendly fork of Balancer on Celo

This proposal aims to expand the Balancer ecosystem to Celo, managed by Symmetric,and make Symmetric the official Friendly Fork of Balancer on Celo.

Background:

Symmetric is a fork of Balancer that currently runs on the Celo and Gnosis Network, and will soft launch on Kava imminently. The project launched in 2021 and has since deployed a V1 and V2 fork of Balancer on both networks in addition to graduating from Celo Camp. Symmetric has close ties to the Celo community and looks to play a large part in Celo’s mission-based activity moving forward.

Symmetric approached BalancerDAO before launching V2, which did not result in an agreement. Symmetric has since shipped and operated their V2 on Gnosis and Celo in July, while BalancerDAO introduced the veBAL tokenomics, launched on Optimism in collaboration with Beethoven, and the bLabs team added a deployment to Gnosis to their roadmap.

Based on these changes, we think it’s the right moment to re-engage and find a mutually beneficial outcome.

Motivation

The Celo Ecosystem, despite relatively low usage, is seeing an increase in interest as the ReFi space native to the chain is growing fast, with projects such as Toucan protocol moving onto Celo recently. Another example is Uniswap moving to Celo with a $10M incentive package from the Celo Foundation’s DeFi for the People initiative focusing on Green Assets. Another significant point is that PrimeDAO is launching a ReFi Launchpad program on Celo in Q4 with $1M in funds available for project launches and liquidity rewards (bribes).

We believe we have the right knowledge, skillset, and network to successfully expand the Balancer protocol onto the Celo network and become one of the top three DEXs on Celo by the end of 2023.

Specifications

Friendly Fork Status

If this vote successfully passes, the Celo deployment of Symmetric will be recognized as the official friendly fork of Balancer on Celo.

SYMM token distribution mechanism

Symmetric plans on developing a system similar to veBAL by which SYMM token distribution is optimized and decentralized through holding of SYMM’s core pool on Celo (SYMM-CUSD) and voting via a simple gauge.

Tokens to become a FF

SymmetricDAO proposes distributing SYMM tokens to BalancerDAO and Balancer Stakeholders to become a Friendly Fork. In exchange for becoming the Friendly Fork on Celo, SymmetricDAO will distribute ~2.5% (12,500 SYMM) of the tokens to BalancerDAO and ~1% (5000 SYMM) to veBAL holders that engage with the deployment by December 31, 2022.",bullish

629,"# Motivation

As some have noticed, the [CREAM/WETH gauge](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/cream-weth-80-20-gauge/3165) we recently approved has been allocated over 40% of BAL emissions. In concert with that, the swap fee on the pool has been set to 10%. This has exposed a hole in our gauge requirements that should be remedied for all past and future gauges. By setting the swap fee to 10% they are attempting to prevent trading in the pool in order to passively farm BAL rewards. 

* For each gauge, the underlying pool's owner must be set to Balancer Governance. If this is not the case, a very good reason must be presented in the gauge proposal

* If Balancer Governance is not the owner, any proposed change to the swap fee must be communicated to Balancer's community in the #swap-fee-and-amplification channel in Balancer's discord. This must be done at least 24h in advance of the change being made and the change can only be made if the Ballers (Balancer community contributors) are in favor.

Failure to adhere to these guidelines for existing gauges where the owner is not Balancer Governance will open the possibility for the [Emergency subDAO](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197) to kill the gauge at their discretion if they believe the swap fee change to be malicious (causing liquidity to be unusable). 

# Risk

* The actor(s) performing these malicious actions together likely have enough voting power to vote down this proposal on snapshot. If they do that, I would petition the Emergency subDAO to kill the gauge and classify this as a governance attack. Up to the other six members if they agree with that assessment or not.

If approved, the above guidelines will immediately and retroactively go into effect. Due to the time sensitive nature, the vote will likely begin later today but discussion can and should continue while the vote is ongoing.",bearish

**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)


# Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.

# About Jarvis Network
Synthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.

jFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.

The protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.

We have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).

Combined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).

We also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.

jEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.

We debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.

The protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:

- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).
- $78M of volume on our primary market.
- 33k swaps by 9k users.
- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).
- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).
- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.
- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.

# Benefits for Aave V3
### Fiat on and off-ramp
jEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.

We have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).

Having jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.

### Large addressable market
A part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).

### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins
jEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.

### DDM
jEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.

### Low risk collateral
As collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.

jEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.

jEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.


# Risk Parameters
With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:

1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.

# Security specification and risks

### Risks inherent to jEUR
Besides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.

jEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.


[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)


### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.
jEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.

There is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.

It does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.

# **Abstract**

We propose the establishment of a financial reporting system for Balancer DAO’s assets. This system will deliver insights into the DAO’s financial status, aiding strategic decision-making.

In the initial phase, we will offer analytics and insights into the treasury. Based on the DAO’s goals and community feedback, we will refine the system to align with the needs of the community and Maxis.



# **Motivation**
Karpatkey has been serving as Balancer DAO’s treasury manager, aiming to help the DAO achieve sustainability. Understanding the DAO’s financial landscape is crucial for making informed business decisions.

Currently, there is no comprehensive method to effectively visualize the DAO’s dynamic financial positions. Available resources include:
1. Karpatkey’s monthly reports on the Karpatkey-managed portion of the treasury.
2. Defilytica’s balances of the DAO as a whole.

However, these resources do not offer an in-depth analysis of the DAO’s overall financial position over time or the flow of funds. Due to the protocol’s multi-chain nature, Balancer is unique in holding assets across various chains, including Mainnet, Arbitrum, and other L2s.

Therefore, Karpatkey proposes building and maintaining a financial system for the DAO Treasury. This system will facilitate Balancer’s integration with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and enable the DAO to better understand its finances, leading to more informed decision-making. The GAAP used shall be determined by Karpatkey based on factors such as international acceptance and understanding, as well as difficulty of implementation.


# **Specification**

Based on GAAP, every transaction since the DAO’s inception would be reviewed and categorized with specific labels (e.g., “Fjord LBP”) and categories (e.g., “Operating revenue”).
The categorized transactions would then be refined into the following information:

* Balance statement (i.e., Initial vs. Final Balances and USD conversions).
* Fund flow analysis.
* Expenses breakdown (e.g., by Service Providers, Payroll, etc.).
* Income breakdown (e.g., Swap & Yield fees, Fjord LBP, L2 fee, etc.).
* Cash flow forecasting (TBD).

The reports will eventually be available on an interactive website, where users can filter and sort based on the desired timeframe for analysis. Until a satisfactory UI is developed, the reports will be delivered in PDF format.
Illustrations of the proposed outcomes can be seen in the following links:

* User Interface Demo:[ https://balaccounting-88030bbe433f.herokuapp.com](https://balaccounting-88030bbe433f.herokuapp.com)
* Interim PDF presentation, including Financial report: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_bmp9DvhOv5sKE9GXw0-hkNdhpweAjsa/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_bmp9DvhOv5sKE9GXw0-hkNdhpweAjsa/view?usp=sharing)

Other concomitant responsibilities will include:



* Integrating the[ bal_addresses](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses) repo for automatic indexing of all on-chain transactions in alignment with the DAO’s labels.
* Reviewing the efficiency of the DAO’s financial structure and publishing findings/recommendations to optimize expenses, operational results, and treasury management.
* Communicating with and supporting Balancer DAO to ensure the system can ultimately be used as a source of truth for potential taxes, legal, accounting, and other inquiries:
    * Conducting workshops with the Maxis to incorporate custom/technical details into the system.
    * Assisting future service providers, legal teams, and accountants in utilizing the system’s data and structure.


# **Budget**

We propose a one-time grant of USD 20,000, fully payable in BAL, to Karpatkey for developing the financial reporting system. 
Additionally, we propose a quarterly fee of USD 6,000, also fully payable in BAL, for maintaining the system, providing monthly reports, and publishing findings and recommendations. For the one-time grant, the amount of BAL to be disbursed will be determined based on the 90-day moving average price of BAL on the payment date. For the quarterly fees, the amount of BAL to be disbursed will be determined based on the 90-day moving average price of BAL on the last day of the third month of each quarter.

Furthermore, Karpatkey pledges to lock each payment in the veBAL contract for at least one year from the moment it is received in Karpatkey’s wallet.

**ETH Address to Receive Funds**: 0x58e6c7ab55Aa9012eAccA16d1ED4c15795669E1C

# **Next steps**

We encourage the community to review and provide feedback on this proposal. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive and useful toolkit for the DAO and its community to leverage for gaining deeper insights into the DAO’s finances.

Below are the suggested future steps and timeline:

1. Conduct a temp-check and review suggestions/feedback from the Balancer community.
2. Request access to the Foundation/OpCos bookkeeping records.
3. Collaborate with the Balancer Product team/Maxis to validate tags, labels, and other technical aspects of the system.
4. Generate financial reports in PDF format on a monthly basis.
5. Build and conduct user testing of the interactive UI.
6. Present the demo UI/product to the community for final feedback.
7. Deliver the UI and commence maintenance.


# **Termination**

Balancer may terminate Karpatkey DAO’s engagement under this agreement for any reason through its Governance Mechanism. Karpatkey DAO may terminate this agreement upon four weeks’ notice, posted as a new discussion thread in the Balancer forum. 
If the termination is requested by Balancer without at least a four-week notice, Karpatkey DAO will be granted an exit fee equal to the fees collected during the last two months, which will be paid in ETH. Regular fees will be collected until the day of termination.

**Protocol Description:**

See here: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708

Centered around [@BalancerLabs](https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs)’s veBAL, Aura coordinates incentives around vote-escrowed tokens to boost yield potential and governance power of DeFi liquidity providers, governance token stakers and voters.

**Motivation:**

The synergies between Balancer and Aura are widely known. The approval of this gauge for the auraBAL/(8020 BAL/ETH BPT) pool will set Aura up for a successful launch period and continue to provide deep liquidity for auraBAL in the years to come.

10% of Aura's total AURA supply is being directed to the Chef contract (0x1ab80F7Fb46B25b7e0B2cfAC23Fc88AC37aaf4e9) over 4-5 years. This flow can be diverted to provide additional rewards on top of the existing BAL & AURA that will be received as part of the natural Gauge deposits. It will also give Aura the opportunity to use this allocation to bribe voters and fuel the secondary market developing around veBAL voting.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

No

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

https://docs.aura.finance/aura/security#audits

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

Aura is a non custodial, non pausable platform.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

No historical volume, however rewards are likely to flow soon and liquidity develop.

636,"#### ABSTRACT

We believe in the following:
1. To achieve the goal of growing the ApeCoin ecosystem, a core focus should be on increasing its use as a form of payment. Even within a bear market, NFT sales/trading continues to be one of the largest crypto-native economies.
2. Projects should have their own marketplace, and the time is now for Yuga Labs & Otherside Partner NFT collections to have our own.
3. It is time for a NFT Marketplace to evolve and serve the needs of the larger NFT economy. One that expands beyond the sale of NFTs but includes additional components like Intellectual Property.

We also believe actions speak louder than words. Instead of offering to build a marketplace, we built one first. It is currently live on the temporary URL: apecoin.x.xyz with the IP marketplace going live if the proposal passes. This allows the community to try the marketplace before voting.

638,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-dao-wave-2/2275).

This draft has been created by the committee of the Balancer Grants DAO. See its previous proposal for establishing this committee [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-establish-the-balancer-grants-dao-and-coordinate-the-next-wave-of-balancer-community-grants/2095).

## Summary
This proposal aims to fund the next cycle (Nov 1st - January 31st) of Balancer Grants DAO. The upcoming program will further accelerate the development of the Balancer ecosystem by improving coordination around Grants, RFPs and Ventures.

The requested budget for this next cycle (3 months) is 50,000 BAL. Similar to the first Balancer Grants DAO proposal, a learnings and review end report will be created at the end of the cycle, and any unspent resources will be sent back to the BAL treasury.

The Balancer Grants committee has already worked together during the first 3 month’s cycle. To maintain continuity and support for the grants that are still running, and the applicants that have applied, we want to have the proposal for the next cycle up and ready on time. The first round has been a success and shows the need and the potential for a bigger Balancer Ecosystem. To get a better idea of what has been done, check out our monthly reports on the [Balancer Community Notion](https://balancergrants.notion.site/Grants-Updates-404ae3750a084de78116cb899b17e2b9). An end report for cycle 1 is being finalized and will be published at the end of the current cycle, which is running until the 31st of October.

From the beginning we have looked at this first round as a time of learning and iterating, building on what works and leaving behind what is useless. With this in mind, the committee requested a lower amount than is often given to grant programs within the crypto space. Now that the committee and the Balancer community is aware of these learning points, the following rounds will no doubt go even smoother than this round already went.

## Impact
Looking back on the first cycle, we can say with confidence that the program has been a success. The program has been able to pull in multiple promising and established DeFi projects into the Balancer Ecosystem. To build long term relationships and grow Balancer’s TVL were the main objectives, and the program is clearly delivering. We as a committee have identified multiple opportunities when it comes to ecosystem building and want to act upon these in the next cycle.

Establishing well-aligned yet autonomous units within the Balancer Ecosystem aligns with Balancer’s Decentralization and Ecosystem strategy. Having multiple entities co-develop the Balancer ecosystem creates value-add opportunities and allows the separate entities to specialize further.

## PROPOSAL
We propose some small changes to the current setup of the grants program, and advocate to further the decentralization of the BalancerDAO. We believe this can be done through multiple committees, initially funded by the Balancer Grants DAO. We understand that this is a slow and long process, so this will be a learning experience where we want to plant the seeds for the future.

The grant program provides support and funding ($5K - USD $75K, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem.

The RFP (bounty) program provides rewards for completion of key tasks identified by the Balancer community. It’s the easiest way for anyone to contribute to the Balancer ecosystem. RFPs can be either technical or non-technical and vary in reward size depending on the required skill set and time needed to complete.

The venture program aims to expand the Balancer ecosystem and further align incentives with ecosystem partners through partnership agreements, token swaps and DAO2DAO ventures. We propose to start this off with a Venture Lead role who will be actively building out these types of deals and structures. With the actual outcomes going to the forum and being voted upon by the community. To support this opportunity, it needs some firepower and a dedicated role plus support can bring that.

The end-goal of the complete program is to attract and retain talent and resources to the Balancer ecosystem.

This AIP aims to sponsor MOCA MONDAY Spaces and establish a rewarding vault for the community

With MOCA MONDAY we want to implement a Cross-Community focused Spaces to educate people of the Mocaverse, BAYC and Apecoin Community about general processes in the DAO, votings and explanations of AIPs.

With the raise of Mocaverse, one of the first Communities to delegate an amount of over 1.5 Million Apecoin, we think it became crucial and important to Build a Cross-Community focused Spaces where these Communities come together to learn about each others Culture and especially educate and learn about the ApecoinDAO in his mindset, the processes of participation, votings and inform about the actual AIPs and their content.

1.1 - Key Highlights

* Educate the Communities about the ApecoinDAO processes

* Weekly discussions about the content of ALL AIPs which are up for Voting

* AIP Authors and Partners live on Stage

* Learn about participation in the ApecoinDAO

* Promote important Cross-Community News & informations

* Higher participation in the ApecoinDAO, the Ape Assembly and the Mocaverse DAO

* Increase the knowledge of all Holders about BAYC, Apecoin, Yugalabs and their Ecosystem.

1.2 - Allocation

Allocation: The funds will be divided into two essential areas:

1. Community Engagement: A portion of the funds will be used to purchase exciting prizes to boost community engagement. This will help us build strong connections between the growing MOCA DAO, Apecoin DAO, and the broader community.

2. Production Enhancement: The other part of the funds will be invested in elevating the production value of these spaces. This includes improvements in editing, distribution, delegation, and marketing.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

* Reach a higher Level in understanding the processes of the ApeCoin DAO for Mocaverse Holders

* Get more educated Voters as they will be educated over every AIP upfront

* Higher the knowledge of AIP Authors how to place their AIPs in the best way in the Mocaverse Ecosystem

* Having more interested people joining the Ape Assembly

* Receiving more engaged AIP Projects which benefits the Apecoin Ecosystem

* Increase Awareness of Apecoin, the DAO, Mocaverse and other potential 3rd Party Communities which become future delegates

* Implementing a Showcase and Reference how different Communities can be integrated in a best possible way into the Story of Apecoin and BAYC to higher participation and growth

* By rewarding participation with BAYC/Mocaverse NFTs as also a crucial amount of Apecoin being rewarded to potentially and mostly new Users of the Apecoin Ecosystem

There is a strong floor price and the number of users who believe in $CAKE is only growing - this is evident in the growing staking pool (Auto CAKE & manual CAKE) and LP pools (BNB-CAKE). Pancakeswap has the historical data and it is carved into the blockchain. Data shows.

title: [Proposal] Whitelist Index Coop's Investment Account Gnosis Safe for Balancer's VotingEscrow
status: Proposed
author: @Matthew_Graham (Index Coop)
created: 10-05-2022

---

# Summary

The proposal aims to add Index Coop DAO’s Investment Account address to the Balancer VotingEscrow whitelist. This will enable the Index Coop Community to vote-lock BAL (B-80BAL-20WETH) and participate in Balancer DAO’s governance, [1].

# Abstract

Index Coop has been in discussions with Balancer DAO about building indices products on Balancer v2 and just recently, created its first liquidity pool on Balancer v2 on the Polygon network, [2,3,4,5]. This delta neutral pool of leverage trading products is the first basket of Index Coop products and symbolisies Index Coop’s strong desire to work with the Balancer community. Index Coop would like to continue investing in the Balancer community relationship by being able to vote-lock BAL (B-80/20 BAL/ETH) and to again, be an active participant within the Balancer DAO governance process.

At the time of writing, Index Coop has approximately $4.4M of capital deposited into the Balancer Boosted Pool on mainnet and to date has earned around 2,500 BAL, [6,7,8]. Index Coop intends to deposit BAL with ETH into the B-80BAL-20WETH pool.

# Motivation

Index Coop intends to build financial products on Balancer v2. To date we have explored creating managed pools that resembled a basket of tokens much like DPI and more recently began exploring how to integrate several products into a single liquidity pool. We had hoped the LAYER1 product would be the first collaboration project and there was strong support within the Index Coop community to build this product on Balancer v2, [9]. It now appears, LAYER1 may not be the initial collaboration product and other opportunities are being explored.

In preparation, Index Coop deployed a portion of the DAOs stablecoins to earn BAL rewards with the intention of locking those BAL rewards and using the veBAL position to support growing future products developed on Balancer v2. With the introduction of ve tokenomics, there is a need for Index Coop to lock the BAL, attain the boosted rewards APY and maximise the veBAL holding potential in order to best support future product launches.

Index Coop has recently created a delta neutral Flexible Leverage Indice pool on Balancer v2 on the Polygon network, [2,3,4,5]. These pools are the first pool where Index Coop is creating a basket of products in one pool. Longer term, the vision is to integrate various strategies like icETH into Balancer Boosted Pools via Index Coop’s exchange issuance. This is expected to offer users varying combinations of yield and risk profile investment options whilst also providing liquidity to the underlying assets.

Prior to the introduction of ve Tokenomics, Index Coop was a keen participant in Balancer DAO’s governance process. Index Coop participated as a DAO on 27 BAL votes, [10]. Although Index Coop’s holding is small, it can still be used to actively participate in Balancer’s governance process.

# Specification

Whitelist `0x462A63D4405A6462b157341A78Fd1baBfD3F8065` to interact with the veBAL contract, [7].

649,"Title: [ARFC] Aave V3 Deployment on BNB Chain

Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative

Date: 2023-04-04

## **Summary**:

This ARFC proposes the deployment of Aave V3 on the BNB Chain, expanding Aave's presence and tapping into the growing DeFi ecosystem and user base of BNB Chain.

## **Abstract**:

Upon approval by the Aave community, Aave V3 will be deployed on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT. This deployment aims to enhance the growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities, providing new opportunities for both ecosystems.

## **Motivation**:

Deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain presents potential benefits for both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and potential additional revenue. In return, BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.

## **Specification**:

The ARFC suggests deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with the following assets for collateral: CAKE, BNB, BTCB, WETH, USDC, and USDT. The table below provides the suggested risk parameters for each asset.

658,"**Proposal Summary**
Blockchain@Columbia, in conjunction with the Fantom and Axelar Team, are proposing to deploy Uniswap V3 on Fantom Chain. Given the BSL expiry, it is crucial for Uniswap to establish market share in other ecosystems. Deployment on Fantom would be beneficial to both Uniswap and Fantom. 

**Overview of Fantom**
Fantom Chain is a highly scalable and secure smart-contract platform designed to enable rapid deployment of dApps. Powered by its unique Directed Acyclic Graph framework and an advanced consensus mechanism, Fantom offers fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. Its innovative architecture has attracted numerous projects and developers.

**Motivation**
As an industry leader, Uniswap has established a strong presence in the DeFi space. In order to maintain its competitive edge, Uniswap must continue to adapt and expand its reach to other blockchain networks. This strategic move will capitalize on current market opportunities and strengthen Uniswap's position in the DeFi landscape.
Axelar is chosen for a number of reasons:
1. The Axelar Network boasts a decentralized Proof of Stake protocol, multiple layers of security features, and the ability to further customize security for Uniswap, if needed. This ensures a robust and secure bridge solution for Uniswap governance.
2. Axelar Network is reliable and has capacity to handle large-scale projects. The Axelar Network has been live for over a year, integrating more than 30 chains with 70 validators through its stack, processing over $1.8 billion in volume, and integrating with major DEXs, wallets, L1/L2, stablecoins, and other projects in the industry.
3. Axelar offers customization options for Uniswap, such as non-upgradable contracts, or contracts governed by Uniswap delegates or UNI token holders. Additionally, Axelar's network can be upgraded following delegated proof-of-stake consensus, ensuring continuous improvements and adaptability.
4. Axelar's General Message Passing capability enables developers building on one chain to call any function on any other connected chain, ensuring complete composability across Web3.
5. Axelar's security model combines a decentralized permissionless network, engineering best practices, and application-level security add-ons to offer robust security for Uniswap's deployment on Fantom.

**Outlook**
	While Fantom’s time in the spotlight has somewhat passed since “DeFi Summer”, the ecosystem still boasts a significant amount of TVL, hovering around $450 million for the majority of the past year with steady growth (DeFiLlama). There is a clear demand for decentralized exchanges on Fantom as four of the top ten protocols are decentralized exchanges, so there’s no doubt that Uniswap will be the leading DEX while also facilitating swaps for currently unavailable pairs. 
	Additionally, the Fantom Foundation has consistently worked to reduce the staking requirements for validators from 3.175m FTM in 2021 to 500,000 FTM. As the requirements needed to validate the network decreases, more users will be able to participate in the validation process.
	Fantom Chain's dedication to the Ethereum ecosystem is evident in its interoperability efforts, developer resources, and focus on driving the growth of decentralized finance. The Fantom team is also committed to fostering collaboration with Ethereum through Axelar Network to enable smooth asset transfers within the two ecosystems. We are convinced that deploying Uniswap on Fantom Chain offers numerous advantages to both Uniswap Labs and its users. 
	We estimate that 30% of the current DEX volume on Fantom would be routed to Uniswap should deployment occur. DEX volume on Fantom is available on DeFiLlama. Uniswap would receive an estimated $30-40 million in volume per week based on the data above as well as deployment on an highly-compatible, low cost chain to test new products and attract users.  

**Engagement Terms**
The deployment and its costs will be borne by the Fantom Foundation and Axelar. As such, no grants or subsidies will be offered to Uniswap. Axelar and Fantom will handle the backend deployment of the smart contracts; however, Uniswap will need to handle the frontend. 

**Bridge Security**

_Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?_
-Yes, arbitrary message passing was described in the Axelar white paper in January 2021, and Axelar released its General Message Passing (GMP) capability to mainnet in April 2022. For example, GMP enables developers building on one chain to call any function on any other connected chain. (We use the word “function” to encompass both smart contracts at the application layer and functions built at the protocol layer, as in Cosmos, for example.) That means complete composability across Web3.
-Like all Axelar functions, General Message Passing relies on a permissionless validator set (delegated proof-of-stake) for security and a decentralized protocol that handles routing and translation.

_Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?_
Robust security comes from (a) the right design, (b) engineering practices, and (c) application-level security add-ons:

(A) The Design: A decentralized permissionless network with a many-to-many communication model. The decentralized and permissionless model has the best practical security guarantees as it encourages diverse validator deployments, incentivizes validators to guard their keys, promotes good behavior, and punishes bad behavior.
-Axelar is the full-stack decentralized transport layer. At the core, it is powered by delegated proof-of-stake consensus to validate cross-chain messages. Applications can instantiate additional validation logic across connected paths 3 that may be governed by the application token, permissioned set, light-client, zk proofs, or other available technologies. Our approach is to:
(a) Offer the best-in-class security via decentralization as the default that solves most use cases for developers.
(b) Allow developers to customize security as needed.
-The Axelar network itself comprises a validator set responsible for maintaining the network and executing transactions, running the Cross-Chain Gateway Protocol, a multi-party cryptography overlay that sits on top of a Layer-1 blockchain. 
-Axelar Gateways are effectively smart contracts that connect the Axelar network to its interconnected external chains. Validators monitor Gateways for incoming transactions, which the validators READ. They then reach a consensus on the validity of that transaction and, once agreed, WRITE to the destination chain’s Gateway to execute the cross-chain transaction.
-The validators and Gateways compose the core infrastructure layer. It’s important to note that relaying across Axelar and its interconnected networks is completely permissionless. This guarantees that no one can censor user transactions and delivers 100% liveness guarantees (assuming the interconnected networks and the Axelar network are running). If relayers are down, the user or anyone else can post transactions, themselves. If one of the interconnected networks is halted or undergoing an upgrade, the packets are just queued up at the network layer and can subsequently be posted (or re-posted) when the networks are back up.
-Proof-of-stake decentralized design at the core - Axelar is built using battle-tested delegated proof-of-stake consensus with a diverse and dynamic validator set that is open to all.
-To further decentralize the network, cross-chain messages are approved if they’re authorized via the quadratic voting rule. That is, the voting power of each validator is equivalent to the square root of their stake. A threshold of validators (currently 60%), weighted by the square root of the stakes, must collectively co-authorize every cross-chain request. With quadratic voting, as validators accumulate stake, it gets harder for them to accumulate voting power.
-Amplify stake security - With Interchain Security available in the Cosmos ecosystem in the coming months, one network can “borrow” the security of other networks. This would allow it to increase the stake used for validation on the network, making any economic attack much more difficult. We also have plans to allow ETH holders to contribute to Axelar’s security, via the restaking model that Eigenlayer introduced recently.

(B) Engineering and Operational Practices
-Key rotations on the network - Validators of the Axelar network maintain keys that allow them to co-authorize cross-chain requests, similarly to how they co-authorize every block on the blockchain. 
-Continuous unit tests & end-to-end tests through the stack - Continuous unit tests and end-to-end tests help discover vulnerabilities and bugs early in the pipeline.
-Audits and bug bounties (see above).

(C) Application-Level Security Add-Ons
-Customize security - Additional paths can be secured by deploying additional validator sets, light-clients, and/or zero-knowledge proofs when available. We think this will be the best instantiation for the Uniswap community: leverage the robust Axelar network for all default traffic. If there is a highly valuable/sensitive transaction, utilize the additional UNI elected validator set for co-signing. See the Appendix for more details on how we propose customizing security for Uniswap.
-Rate limits - The Gateways and the Axelar network have a rate-limiting function, which limits how much of each asset can be transferred in a given time interval.

Sitting atop the validators and Gateways are Axelar services and APIs that enable developers to access the tools and infrastructure enabled by those validators and Gateways. These services and APIs do not add any security assumptions.

_Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?_
A majority of Axelar validators attest to messages that pass from Ethereum to a destination chain. The voting threshold is 60%, based on the validator’s quadratic stake (current stake distribution: Validators | Axelarscan). An adversary who can corrupt 60% of voting power can pass fraudulent messages. The adversary could try to corrupt enough servers to do this, but mechanisms such as key rotations & rate limits minimize the potential of these attacks.

_What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?_
-Axelar validators get slashed on the Cosmos SDK level, the same way that validators of any other Cosmos chains get slashed for misbehavior.
-There is a penalty for validators who don’t maintain sufficient uptime. When a validator doesn’t vote on enough cross-chain events, they’re penalized with a loss of stake and rewards.
-Validators who misbehave significantly (double signing blocks, not participating for a long period of time) get jailed.

Within the TM consensus rewards, rewards slashing rules are set as follows:
-Validators will lose the TM Consensus rewards if they lose liveness and get jailed if they don’t participate for a longer duration.
-Validators need to sign 50% of the blocks in every 35,000-block window.
-Given a block time of five seconds, this corresponds to maintaining total liveness for at least one day in every two-day window.
-They lose 0.01% of rewards per block for downtime and 2% for double signing blocks.

If the validators lose liveness for more than 50% of the window, then they are locked (“jailed” in Cosmos terminology, forbidden from rejoining the validator set) for two hours (about 1,440 blocks), after which they would need to unlock themselves. Axelar network implements an unbonding period of seven days.

_Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?_
-Yes, the Axelar network code has been audited over 30 times and continues to go through continuous and rigorous audits. 
-There is also a $2.25 million bug bounty program on Immunefi.
-Axelar network and contracts are all open-source to encourage white-hat revisions

**Future Alterations**
Once a cross-chain deployment method is finalized in the future, we wholeheartedly support changing current deployment mechanisms to fit the new process. However, given the urgency of this proposal, we believe that the currently proposed deployment with Axelar is needed. 

**Timeline**
After the completion of the on-chain vote, Axelar will handle Uniswap V3 smart contract deployments on Fantom while Uniswap Labs handles the front-end integration. This is estimated to take ~4-6 weeks with audits.",bullish

666,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197)

# Motivation

The [Emergency DAO](https://dao.curve.fi/emergencymembers) is an idea pioneered by Curve that empowers a small group to “kill” pools and gauges in the event of malicious activity and/or potential loss of funds. So far the power has only been used once to [kill the Mochi pool](https://gov.curve.fi/t/the-curve-emergency-dao-has-killed-the-usdm-gauge/2307).

This proposal is being presented as a response to the situation Balancer is facing regarding the three element pools ([1](https://app.element.fi/pools/0xEdf085f65b4F6c155e13155502Ef925c9a756003?action=redeem))([2](https://app.element.fi/pools/0x4bd6D86dEBdB9F5413e631Ad386c4427DC9D01B2?action=redeem))([3](https://app.element.fi/pools/0x7Edde0CB05ED19e03A9a47CD5E53fC57FDe1c80c?action=redeem)) which were grandfathered into the gauge voting system when veBAL launched. A single LP has staked in the gauges and has bribed on hidden hand to entice voters while this single actor collects all the emissions.

Given that these element pools have expired they should no longer be eligible for BAL emissions.

A governance proposal will be required to change signers of this multisig. To be clear, Balancer’s Emergency subDAO will only have the power to kill gauges. Balancer pools cannot be “killed” by governance after the pool factory has been deployed for three months.

An additional power of the Emergency subDAO will be to add a token to the deny list on the newly created “[ProtocolFeesWithdrawer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introduce-protocolfeeswithdrawer/3188)” contract. In order for a token to be added back to the allow list a veBAL governance vote would be required. A token would only be added to the deny list in the event of an issue along the lines of the recent [Synthetix bug disclosure](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/medium-severity-bug-found/3161).

669,"[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum.](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217)

**TL;DR**

Proposal to modify the token whitelist process from the status quo. The method described circumvents the need for any subjective decision-making at the time of whitelisting, instead favoring a set of purely technical criteria. To protect the liquidity mining program from bad actors, a series of cap tiers is added to the capFactor computation (see the [original capFactor proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56) for reference), with the default cap for new tokens being reduced to just $1M of adjusted liquidity.

**Context**

After seven weeks of whitelisting, we've begun to observe some serious contention within/regarding the existing token whitelist process. Namely, it is no longer acceptable for me (@rabmarut) to have subjective control over the list. There has been too much controversy recently about the interpretation of certain listing criteria, and no entity should have the power to make those interpretations.

The current criteria for whitelisting are described in the [original whitelist proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposing-the-token-whitelist-for-bal-distribution/55) and copied below:

1. Token must return boolean success on transfer. If an ERC-20 does not return a bool when transfer() is called, it is broken within Balancer v1. Funds added to Balancer liquidity pools will be irrecoverable, and there is nothing the team can do to intervene; Balancer v1 is a set of immutable smart contracts with no administrative keys.
2. Token must not charge fees on transfer. While not necessarily intended as an attack vector, transfer fees are dangerous for Balancer pools. Every trade or removal of liquidity from pools containing these assets will result in a pool price which is “out of sync” with the true balances. Arbitrageurs can gulp() the pool and then trade with it at liquidity providers’ expense. Among others, all “deflationary” assets fall into this category.
3. Token contract must be verified on etherscan. This metric favors tokens which value transparency and reliability.
4. Token must be listed and have a live USD price feed on CoinGecko. This is the price oracle used for distributing BAL proportional to shares of overall liquidity.
5. Token distribution must be somewhat equitable. This is a highly subjective metric subject to community consensus, but in general the desire is for tokens to be somewhat evenly distributed. If the founders, for example, hold 90% of the supply, there are probably ways in which they can hurt liquidity providers or extract disproportionate BAL rewards by artificially driving up the token’s price.
6. Token must provide some form of “real” value. This is another highly subjective metric, but the idea is for the community to actively filter out tokens which have been promoted as “pump-and-dump” schemes, which could hurt unknowing liquidity providers.

It seems clear that Criterion #6 is far too subjective and therefore prone to the curator's interpretation.

**The Proposal**

Criterion #6 (above) will be removed from the existing list, and Criteria #1-5 will fully govern the whitelisting process. That is, there will be a minimal set of _objective_ criteria for listing: a token must be technically compatible with Balancer, and its distribution must not raise any red flags as to the ability of a single party to game Balancer's liquidity mining program by manipulating either the token's price or supply. These criteria are fully focused on:

1. Protecting Balancer liquidity providers from loss of funds.
2. Protecting the BAL distribution from centralized actors.

The barrier to entry would be quite low for whitelisting tokens, but at any time, if a token is deemed to be either _maliciously harming LPs or gaming the BAL distribution_, it could be removed with a governance vote. Note that this approach passes no judgment on the intrinsic value of a token and leaves liquidity providers to decide for themselves what is and is not a ""good investment"" or a ""legitimate project."" Tokens would never be omitted or removed from the list on subjective merits; rather, one of two explicit removal criteria must be met:

1. There is significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that a fraudulent event took place in which token holders lost funds, i.e. an _exit scam_.
2. The token is being used as a BAL farm, thereby disadvantaging other Balancer liquidity providers. For example, perhaps 80% of the token's supply sits in a Balancer pool with a 0.0001% fee, and it draws either very little or mostly inorganic trade volume. Care must be taken not to over-emphasize volume here, but it may _help_ to refine the list of potential manipulators. Another example of BAL farming could be that a single entity launches many different tokens to circumvent the $1M liquidity cap.

In calculating the week's BAL distribution, each token's total liquidity is adjusted by the feeFactor, ratioFactor, and wrapFactor; then the adjusted liquidity is capped at a predefined USD-denominated limit. This capFactor mechanism exists to ensure that no one token can reap a disproportionate share of the week's liquidity mining reward. To mitigate the potential consequences of the permissive listing scheme described above, I propose to make the default cap for each new token quite small. The capFactor system would be modified such that, instead of a single cap (now $10M) applied to all tokens, there would be several tiers of capping:

```
cap1:   $1M
cap2:   $3M
cap3:  $10M
cap4:  $30M
cap5: $100M
```

To ease the transition to this new scheme, the status quo of a $10M cap will be maintained for all existing whitelisted tokens - this puts existing tokens at `cap3`. All new tokens, upon being added to the whitelist, would instead be capped by default at `cap1`. At any time, community members may propose to vote a token into a different cap tier. Though not an explicit requirement, the spirit of these changes would be that of reactive necessity rather than preemptive ranking: if a token's TVL on Balancer nears or exceeds that token's cap, vote to raise the cap to the next tier. All such votes would be conducted with three options, for the sake of fairness of governance:

1. No change
2. Migrate the token up to the next (adjacent) cap tier
3. Migrate the token down to the previous (adjacent) cap tier

Furthermore, the cap tiers themselves can be adjusted in value (scaled up or down) by vote, as market conditions may result in more or less USD-denominated TVL across Balancer pools. These votes would be far less frequent and more flexible in structure.

**Conclusion**

Balancer's liquidity mining program was always designed to be permissive. The introduction of a token whitelist was nothing more than a necessary evil to inhibit known attacks on the BAL token distribution. My hope is that the new cap structure and token removal criteria will prove strong enough to mitigate such attacks moving forward, while still enabling Balancer's trustless and permissionless vision.",bearish

title: [ARFC] Add CRV to Ethereum v3
Author:@Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham), @dydymoon
Dated: 2023-02-01

---

# Summary

This proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard CRV to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

# Abstract

CRV is a strategic asset to Aave and any CRV earned from the pool could be used by Aave to create veCRV for the purpose of bootstrapping the adoption of GHO, the new staked aToken being developed by @AaveCompanies and in the long term, might help incentivize the Safety Module too.

The risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the [initial forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum.

By presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.

# Motivation

Listing CRV on Aave v3 Ethereum compliments the community's recent on-market purchase of CRV to [repay the excessive debt](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-repay-excess-crv-debt-on-ethereum-v2/10955) created on v2 Ethereum. CRV is a material contributor to Aave’s revenue through the continual borrowing demand for CRV. Month on Month revenue has fallen significantly as a result of disabling borrowing on the Ethereum v2 deployment.

![|602x361](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jSbcyMZwGNrjEqPMIvbDcOE3ietLQ7rRlhQ6mZBaOfKG1JqGmja0Go6vE1KaUcVNM5Y6FiSBvXnNlj_i46gMo6LmAOnyPlpsgRBVRVtRvc2Zm3Lw1-NhE0lMZqHLEOsu2U8NqH3TMtxIKFvi30H1-w4)

There is strong ongoing borrowing demand for CRV due to the veTokenomics and the extrinsic use cases created by Convex Finance and projects built on top of veCRV. The chart below shows how freezing the CRV on [Polygon v2](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/124/) and disabling boring on [Ethereum v2](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/125/) during late November 2022 has affected deposit rates on Polygon v3. The Polygon v3 deployment is the only liquidity pool with Borrowing enabled, as a result there has been notable volatility in deposit rates.

![|602x193](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zp1IEca82kVsME-0-eMHhlakx58hbkG-3a10rCZX1eZE9Gll3Zpe6ocvSnpfnowIzML6p0_k3SkBBAExdoKN6icLKygWW7eOi7tRiDuz6785miZx8aRDRjrj3fNWT8U_sXgFv5qVhVQCHc9nPuoHNUY)

By listing CRV on Ethereum v3, with Borrowing Enabled and a suitable BorrowCap users will have the ability to migrate from v2 to v3 and borrow CRV, generating revenue for Aave. Any CRV earned by Aave can be used to create veCRV, assuming Aave has access to the Curve voter escrow contract, which can then be used to vote CRV incentives to any combination of pools chosen by the community. How the CRV will be used is open for Aave to discuss and implement via a future proposal.

For listing CRV, this proposal uses risk parameters suggested by Gauntlet on the original [[ARC] Aave v3 Ethereum Deployment: Assets and Configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) post. The interest rate curve parameters have been sourced from @Llamaxyz’s [[ARFC] CRV Interest Rate Curve Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-crv-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/11337) post, which is soon to be presented on Snapshot for voting.

## Protocol Description:

Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a DAO and started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.

Inverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;

* On the supply side of money markets by Inverse Finance's “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.
* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA-3POOL through our partnership with Yearn (currently $56M TVL), or the DOLA-FRAX basepool through our partnership with Frax.
* Via purcha stablecose with DAIin using[ The Stabilizer](https://www.inverse.finance/swap/DAI/DOLA).

DOLA is not ""algorithmic"" and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.

## Motivation:

This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the DOLA/bb-f-usd 50/50 stable pool. Inverse recently successfully obtained a veBAL gauge for the [INV/DOLA](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x0678e2094fa6b3adf61e319c3000b6080f84d43d7555552510dfd2949fa8c4c0) 50-50 pool on Balancer and this proposal aims to build on this momentum. Platform BAL incentives would help deepen DOLA liquidity as we seek to further alleviate our dependence on the Curve ecosystem for DOLA liquidity. The [DOLA-3CRV](https://curve.fi/factory/27) gauge on Curve currently has over $56MTVL ($108M ATH) and Inverse recently obtained gauge approval for a [DOLA-FraxBP](https://curve.fi/factory/176); we have provided around $1mm USD value in bribe incentives to drive liquidity into these pool. If approved, we expect to do the same for our veBAL gauge and are in coordination with Hidden Hand to facilitate the incentivization and drive the Balancer bribe market narrative.

The Inverse Finance Team aims to be a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions utilizing Redacted Cartel’s Hidden Hand (“HH”) platform to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Once the 50/50 DOLA/bb-f-usd stable pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer.

## Specifications:

You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.

**Governance:**

Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to the [DOLA-3CRV](https://curve.fi/factory/27) and [DOLA-FraxBP](https://curve.fi/factory/176) Curve pools as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.

**Oracles:**

A custom INV oracle with both a price ceiling and borrow cap feature has been in use following a price manipulation[ incident on April 2nd](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/our-plan-making-good). This oracle has been reviewed by Peckshield and is actively managed by Inverse’s Risk team.

Inverse Finance’s new lending market is due to release later this year after audits and will use ChainLink price oracles. Inverse Finance's old lending market relied on both ChainLink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable.

**Audits:**

Inverse DAO has recently established a working relationship with [Peckshield](https://peckshield.com/), and boutique security firm [Defimoon](https://defimoon.org/). A first round audit of a recent product was produced ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWNG08mib2GcI1WqnMt5IdFoW73QU2F8/view?usp=sharing)), and an audit of relevant legacy code is in progress. The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. A recent announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).

**Centralization vectors:**

Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:

* Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.
* Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.
* Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 9 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.
* Fed Chair: 2 of 5 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts.

Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).

DOLA stablecoin is fully decentralized, with no possibility to pause or blacklist any addresses, even if INV governance wanted to do so.

**Market History:**

Inverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the “Feds”, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLA’s Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. We now expect to have further resilience through the deepening of our [DOLA-FraxBP](https://curve.fi/factory/176) and our [INV-DOLA](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x441b8a1980f2f2e43a9397099d15cc2fe6d3625000020000000000000000035f) bal LP.

# Reactivation

Hi! On behalf of the GnosisDAO, I'd like to reactivate the discussion so we can rerun the vote to **increase the GNO cap from Cap3 to Cap4 ($10M -> $30M)**

As @rabmarut stated:

- There is currently ~$19M worth of GNO in Balancer pools, making it the most liquid DEX for GNO

- Raising the cap would further incentivise liquidity, which is beneficial for both GnosisDAO (people can acquire the token in larger amounts) and Balancer (more trading volume) 

- This would further strengthen our synergies for a collaboration around GPv2 Meta-DEX Aggregator and Balancer

- GnosisDAO has committed to not selling BAL in the market and will instead hold the tokens in order to be an active governance participant

Looking forward to get the voting started once more!

# Original

**TL;DR**

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). GNO adjusted liquidity has been consistently greater than $10m since December 2020.

**The Proposal**

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M).

At the time of writing GNO has over $22M in total liquidity on Balancer Pools, and has thus surpassed its $10M cap.

Gnosis hopes to further strengthen synergies with Balancer in light of the upcoming launch of Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator. V2 channels orders to underlying on-chain AMMs for execution and hopes to be integrating Balancer as one of its first partners.

As Gnosis has contributed liquidity for multiple Balancer pools, Gnosis currently holds 52,146 BAL. Gnosis holds and continues to earn a significant amount of BAL tokens which it intends to transfer to GnosisDAO to hold as an investment, instead of selling in the open market.

[Balancer is currently the most liquid exchange for GNO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gnosis) and it would be good to keep incentivizing it to avoid the fragmentation of its liquidity. The GNO token migration to other exchanges could potentially reduce Balancer’s competitive advantage of having the lowest fee and slippage for GNO/ETH pairs.

**What is GNO?**

GNO is the governance token of [GnosisDAO](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosisdao-a7102fcf9224), which launched Nov 23rd 2020 and has since seen significant growth in community engagement. It currently has a $164M market cap.

GnosisDAO owns several core Ethereum infrastructure components such as the Gnosis Safe which currently holds [more than 2% of the total ETH supply](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/ul0PgNtcq9MwezZThlHrgOMEIzpvEmkdwA9XoVqi). GnosisDAO will soon launch Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator that channels liquidity to on-chain AMMs such as Balancer.",bullish

As mentioned in our initial [**veCAKE proposal**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), we are launching veCAKE in phases, and are excited to share the next deployment - zkSync!

#### Recap: Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

As a quick summary, here’s quick recap of veCAKE, with the following utilities:

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders will be able to directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE managers and bribe markets, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE rewards and receive voting incentives for doing so. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to automate their voting and potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
#### Inclusion of zkSync in veCAKE Gauges System

Currently, the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum is **~0.99 CAKE/block**.  

With the inclusion of zkSync, the current **Trading Allocation** emission of 0.0131 CAKE per block directed towards zkSync Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions. 

As part of the voting gauges design, the Kitchen proposes to retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs, such as ETH-USDC on zkSync. 



There are two key reasons:
- To ensure a smooth transition for liquidity providers from farms managed by the Kitchen to farms which are managed by veCAKE voting, without affecting their APRs significantly in the initial rollout
- To ensure that core liquidity pools continue to receive sufficient incentives, so that liquidity depth and fee generation are not significantly affected. This will ensure the continuity of CAKE burns from trading fees, which drives deflationary CAKE tokenomics.

In the initial rollout phase, the Kitchen will distribute these votes based on the following principles:
- Ensuring core liquidity pools are provided a competitive return on their LP positions
- Ensuring that existing Syrup Pool partner arrangements are met before migrating them fully to the veCAKE gauge voting system
- Ensuring that any of the smaller farms which did not receive any votes after the launch of veCAKE will receive at least some allocation in the initial rollout, capped at their current emission levels.

With the proposed vote allocation, the Kitchen will distribute its share of votes at the end of each voting epoch after all voting participants have voted. 

In other words, the Kitchen will apply its voting share (at maximum, translating to ~0.4 CAKE/block) as far as needed to smoothen out any possible abrupt changes in the Farms, while allowing veCAKE participants to get used to the gauge voting mechanism. 

If the gauge voting results will not affect any core liquidity pools and trading volumes significantly, the Kitchen will abstain from voting in that particular voting epoch or vote in alignment with existing votes.

Over time, the Kitchen aims to reduce the portion of CAKE emissions directly managed by the Kitchen as all veCAKE participants become familiar with the process.

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE launched shortly on zkSync after this vote concludes.",bullish
679,"Greetings! 

As you all know right now if you do anything on pancake swap you should pay a fee to BSC and this is not fair at all bcuz Pancakeswap protocol is a Defi and it should be free for cake holders , also it could get really faster if Cake has it's own ""Blockchain"" 
Everything will get really faster and even cheaper and of course with these numbers of cake staking it could be a very successful ""Proof of Staking"" blockchain ! 

I suggest this project to build it's own blockchain and name it ""CSC""  #Cakeswapchain 

Gas free , secure , fast , scalable and with smart contract ability !",bullish
680,"To re-motivate the old stakers, it would be interesting to overhaul the syrup pool. I propose to stake Cake and obtain cake in small quantities (1/2%) but also the other cryptos usually distributed in the syrup pool. 

This would thus make it possible to break inflation and re-motivate long-term stacking.",bullish
681,"It seems that the current system for displaying results and all vote results is not functioning properly, I would like to see this fixed.

It would be helpful if there was a way for the community to discuss each of the proposals and offer suggestions or modifications from the community with the ability to amendmed of the original proposal in the comunitys view. 

This would allow for more transparency and democracy within the decision-making process.",neutral
682,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Helio Protocol Destablecoin ($HAY) to Syrup Pool Again!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Helio Protocol!

Helio Protocol is an open-source liquidity protocol for borrowing and earning yield on HAY, which is a [**“destablecoin”**](https://docs.helio.money/) over-collateralized with liquid staked assets.

Users can mint HAY by depositing BNB or BUSD tokens on the [**Helio Protocol App**](https://helio.money/app/loans/).

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn HAY tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 30,000 HAY
 - **Distribution duration:** 45 days
 - **Start time:** To be announced
 - **Finish time:** 45 days after Start time
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.02314 HAY

The start time of the Syrup Pool will be announced at least 24 hours prior on our social media channels.

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours of the Syrup Pool.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the Stake CAKE, Earn HAY Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing BNB-HAY (0.25%), BTCB-HAY (0.25%), and ETH-HAY (0.25%) v3 farms. The Farms will start at the same time as the Syrup Pool, to be announced at least 24 hours prior on our socials.


The BNB-HAY farm will have **8.5x CAKE rewards**, while the BTCB-HAY and ETH-HAY farms will each have **5x CAKE rewards** for the 45-day period. The duration and multipliers of the farms may be adjusted to optimize CAKE emissions, but the aggregate CAKE emitted to Helio Protocol farms will remain the same.

During and at the end of the 45-day period, the Farms will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### What is a “destablecoin”?

From the team: “Destablecoin is a new type of asset class within the crypto space that seeks to label a more accurate term in the current stablecoin landscape. 

**The prefix “de-” stands for decentralized** - it does not signify price volatility the way assets such as BTC experience, but serves to distinguish itself from legacy stablecoin products such as BUSD and USDC that are controlled by a centralized custodian. In contrast, destablecoins utilize decentralized, liquid-staked crypto assets as collateral to achieve maximum capital efficiency while staying fully collateralized and asset backed.

Using the term “destablecoins” also signals the underlying risk of stablecoins and encourages users to invest more responsibly. It will allow for some price fluctuations as regular fiat-currencies would experience with varying reference rates and interest rate parities as defined by the open market.”

#### What is $HAY?

From the team: “HAY is Helio Protocol’s new destablecoin. Its use cases include borrowing HAY by depositing BNB or BUSD as collateral in the protocol, liquidity mining on LP DEXes, and as a means of payment to transfer value for goods & services. Users can also enjoy ~5.5% APR by staking HAY with the protocol.

A step-by-step guide on how to interact with HAY can be found [**here**](https://docs.helio.money/)”

683,"##### ABSTRACT
Ape Express aims to launch the ultimate toolkit for a thriving memecoin ecosystem on ApeChain, empowering users with the tools they need to create, customize and deploy tokens on ApeChain.

With Ape Express no technical skills are needed for safe, unruggable launches. Configure and deploy your token with multiple features in seconds.

Streamlined liquidity management: borrow, deploy, and lock liquidity effortlessly. Developers can deploy an LP using borrowed capital, and launch a coin with a starting market cap of $15K while spending only $300 out of pocket. 
Liquidity loans can be automatically repaid from token taxes, liquidity, or manual payment.

In one place users can create their brand identity, deploy tokens, manage liquidity, build and engage their community. (Think Pump.fun on ApeChain, but way better and less trash. For instance, on Pump.fun tokens start with 1K MC, and never have a chance to reach a DEX. With our system, every launch makes it to the DEX of choice and encourages a free open market on ApeChain.)

Token creators will have an option and be encouraged to airdrop portion of their supply to the holders of the blue chip collections of Yuga ecosystem. BAYC/MAYC/BAKC, CryptoPunks, Kodas, Moonbirds and Mocaverse holders.

This will bring benefit to the holders of these collections and, at the same time, give the upcoming projects an opportunity to reach the high quality user bases that are the lifeblood of these collections.

All of these processes are streamlined in the dapp so that anyone can do it with a few clicks of a button.

This project aims to expand the ApeCoin ecosystem, increase token velocity, TVL and offer new opportunities for the builders in the ApeChain ecosystem.

None of the funds requested in this proposal will be spent on development or team salary. This proposal aims to bootstrap platform liquidity and the Ape Express marketing budget.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
1. Ape Express will give 10% of all gross revenue from platform fees back to the Apecoin DAO’s treasury.
2. Onboarding memecoin degens from other chains and converting this liquidity into $APE.
3. Boosting APE liquidity pairs: Ape Express encourages users to pair their tokens with $APE by automatically converting ETH, USDT, and other assets used on the platform into $APE. By locking APE in LPs we contribute to the overall TVL of the ApeChain.
4. Amplifying on-chain activity: by facilitating fast and easy token creation and trading of memecoins, we drive overall transactions volume. Memecoin trading volume on Solana accounts for $1.2B daily, and over $120M in volume on Base chain. We drive transaction volume to the ApeChain native DEX.
5. Enhancing APE token velocity: gas fees, liquidity loans, and buybacks will all utilize $APE.
6. Backed by The Crypto is a Fun marketing engine. The apes you see above are some of the most prolific memecoin degens in web3. We have our fingers on the pulse of the space and can push our audience over to ApeChain. We run the #1 daily memecoin spaces on CT best believe we will promote ApeChain and Ape Express to the masses.
7. With our novel liquidity loan system we will attract aspiring devs because of the low barrier to entry. They don’t need initial liquidity - they just need a dream and that dog in em

LIST of FEATURES:
1. Token creation
2. Liquidity loans (initial LP)
3. Option to airdrop portion of supply to BAYC/MAYC or other Yuga NFTs.
4. Telegram trading bot - web-facing interface
5. Liquidity lockers
6. Airdrop multi sender
7. Stake APE to earn platform-generated revenue
8. Competitive leaderboard for hot pairs and contest
9. Degen Analytic bots
10. AI Website & brand builder

PLATFORMS & TECHNOLOGIES:
* Smart contracts for deploying tokens
* Smart contracts for lending liquidity & liquidity locker built-in
* Smart contracts and mechanisms for clawing back lent out liquidity

We have created our own set of contracts which interact with each other, giving as much fluidity and flexibility to the system as possible. Users simply pay for token minting, which is dependent on how many features they are including in the token. This acts as initial revenue for the product to safeguard minor expenses with regard to the deploying costs(the user’s token and other related contracts per product deployed), and liquidity rounding errors from the lending activities.

There are several ways for users to repay the loans:
* Direct payment: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, repay a direct 12,500 APE to receive ownership of LP tokens (albeit locked until the lock period is over)
* Tax Tokens: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and passively repay 12,500 APE as taxes are generated from the trading activity of the token. All taxes are diverted to repaying the loan until completed. The creator will then receive ownership of the LP, and release it to their creator’s address when the lock period is over.
* Liquidity Threshold: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and as the liquidity pool grows from net buying activity, a loan with interest is repaid via clawback. This means the user can select a 2x with a 25% interest to repay 12,500 APE when the liquidity pool contains at least 20,000 APE. This approach is generally regarded to be safest when a higher threshold is selected (as high as 5x is available). This process is an automated repayment method.

Another product is the liquidity locker. All created tokens are automatically opted into this feature with a minimum of 30 days, which begins when the loan is repaid in full. Tokens created outside the platform can also use this feature given they make a small payment in APE tokens. The lock period ranges from 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

Finally, Ape Express will be equipped with a mass sender contract and UI. This is for any creator wanting to do an airdrop or presale distribution manually.

Ape Express’ GTM strategy will include a referral/discount coupon program, initially to be issued by team members. In addition, APE stakers (10k tokens staked and up) will be able to generate their own referral and discount codes customizable up to 20% referral/discount mix.

An incentive program will also be put into action if approved for a grant. The tokens with the most activity, measured by volume and holders, will be awarded APE tokens every week for the token’s creator/treasury. These metrics are reset every week to further incentivize only currently active projects or new projects to receive such rewards.

Although we cant stop people from creating NSFW tickers on a permissionless blockchain we will have measures on our backend to hide any racist, hateful or pornographic material from our leaderboards. We can control what is represented on our platform and we will carefully monitor this to make sure we are in line with Apecoin guidelines

684,"Join us in welcoming Star Sharks Token (SSS) to PancakeSwap IFO! If this vote passes, you’ll be able to buy $SSS tokens with CAKE during the token launch.

We’ve heard you. We realize the current format is far from ideal. But bear in mind that any new features require time and effort to develop and pass security audits. Since security is always our priority. In the meantime, while we are working on a new IFO format that will benefit loyal CAKE holders, we do not want our community to miss out on any new IFO opportunities either.

So in addition to heavily adjusting the participation fee tiers, we have also tweaked the Basic and Unlimited Sale allocations. While this might not be the most ideal scenario for everyone, we hope that this provides a more equitable allocation for every IFO participant. See below for more details.

### Background: 
Uniswap’s [genesis liquidity incentive program](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) ended on Nov 17. The program distributed 20 million UNI to LPs over 2 months, split evenly between the WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, and DAI/ETH pools. This worked out to 2.5 million UNI per pool, per month.

#### Benefits of UNI distribution to LPs:
Ongoing incentives allows UNI to be distributed to those providing value in the form of liquidity
The incentivized pools are likely to remain the most liquid DEX pair on Ethereum, providing a venue to trade against ETH at virtually any size with zero slippage.
Reduced incentives prevents UNI from being distributed ‘too fast’, marked by all tokens being distributed before the Foundation’s four year vesting has passed.

#### Drawbacks of UNI distribution to LPs:
Ongoing incentives result in UNI largely being ‘farmed and dumped’ to earn yield. See ETH USD Yield Farm, Pickle, Harvest and Alpha.
Reduced incentives means UNI is distributed slower.
Incentivizing the same pools can be seen as choosing ‘winners’ by selecting WBTC as THE Bitcoin on Ethereum and favoring certain stablecoins over others.

### Proposed new distribution: 
Distribute UNI for an additional 2 months from the time this proposal is adopted and executed by governance, but at half the rate of the previous distribution (5 million UNI per month instead of 10 million UNI per month). 

**Note that pool distributions were adjusted slightly from the previous [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-distribute-uni-to-liquidity-providers/8591) process**. Reasoning behind this adjustment can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590/68). 

UNI will be distributed to the following 4 pools:
WBTC/ETH - 1.67 million UNI per month, ⅓ of total
USDC/ETH - 1.25 million UNI per month, ¼ of total
USDT/ETH - 1.25 million UNI per month, ¼ of total
DAI/ETH - 0.83 million UNI per month, ⅙ of total

Please see the liquidity incentive [governance plan document](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590) for full details and timelines. 

### Consensus check question:

Should Uniswap distribute UNI to liquidity providers per the specifications outlined above?

### Next steps:
The previous [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-distribute-uni-to-liquidity-providers/8591) process passed with sufficient support of UNI voters. The following consensus check poll is the second phase of Uniswap’s [governance process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732).

The snapshot poll will be live for 5 days. If the poll passes with a minimum of 50,000 UNI in support, this initiative will move forward as a formal governance proposal.

686,"**Title** : [TEMP CHECK] Qualify the security incident 04-11-2023 as a shortfall event
**Author** : John Doe
**Date**: 2023-11-11
# Motivation

Qualify the security incident reported here: https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v2-v3-security-incident-04-11-2023/ as a [shortfall event](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module#shortfall-events) in order to activate the [safety module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module).

# Summary 

Users have lost funds during the aforementioned incident as a consequence of the assets being frozen/paused. Users have reported two type of losses: 
 * losses resulting from liquidation
 * losses resulting from high interest rates and accruing interests

As  [stated](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module#shortfall-events) in the definition of a shortfall event:

*The main role of the Safety Module is to protect the protocol against **unexpected loss** of funds stemming from:*

* **Smart contract risk** : *Risk of a bug, design flaw or potential attack surfaces on the smart contract layer.*
* [...]

Given that the losses reported by the users are:
 * resulting from an undisclosed smart contract risk leading to the freezing/pause action
 * unexpected, given the unexpected nature of the freeze/pause action

It seems conclusive to me that the incident satisfies the definition of a shortfall event.

 # Specification

This TEMP CHECK does not require any on-chain action or protocol changes.

# Disclaimer

**No Guarantee of Results; and Limitation of Liability:**

This proposal is neutrally presented based on current community sentiment. Given the evolving nature of DAOs, there’s no assurance that the proposed changes will yield the intended results. The author(s) and associated parties are not liable for any outcomes or damages from this proposal’s implementation or lack thereof.

# Next Steps

If this TEMP CHECK is approved, the next step is the activation of the safety module.

# Summary

As a recap, on 13 April 2022, a [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-incorporation-of-the-balancer-foundation/2989) was brought to the BalancerDAO (or the “DAO”) to incorporate the Balancer Foundation (or the “Foundation”). The Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work, furthering Balancer’s decentralization goals, and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.

The Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate, and provides, among others, two primary benefits:

It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts. In addition, for example, it intends to establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto.

It encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, it could engage business development or tech providers.

In short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the BalancerDAO in the structure of the traditional business world.

The Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.

Running a Foundation Company comes with certain real-world costs and financial reserve requirements. These are laid out below, first in summary and then in detail for reference.

## Specification - Foundation Expenses and reserves

This proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2022 running through March 2023, and a self-insurance reserve.

### Foundation Expenses

The summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.

The Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, so April / May /June is the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, although it is the first quarter for which funding is requested.

1. Q2 FY22 - USDC 32,941 - actual expenses incurred through the end of May 2022 and forecast for June 2022 - immediate payment requested
2. Q3 FY22 - USDC 67,919 - for transfer 25 June 2022
3. Q4 FY22 - USDC 67,969 - for transfer 25 September 2022
4. Q1 FY23 - USDC 78,384 - for transfer 15 December 2022

The table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter. Descriptions for each line item are included under the “Detail” section further below.

![|624x417.174903581549](upload://vPqyfiEv162ngVFJ64ipxJDv5Ii.jpeg)

### Foundation Self Insurance Reserve

As part of this proposal, we are asking BalancerDAO to hold the equivalent of US$500,000 as a self-insurance reserve, earmarked for a year and to be revisited after a year. The reserve can be maintained in BAL tokens given current market conditions, but must at all times be available to the Foundation should it be needed, and must be maintained at an equivalent value of US$500,000. More on this reserve requirement can be found in the “Detail” section below.

Note: the proposal is for funding at the Balancer Foundation level, it does not include funding for:

1. Balancer OpCo Limited, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) subsidiary and operating company that will house the front-end development team for BalancerDAO,
2. Other third-party service providers to the BalancerDAO, such as Orb Collective and Kolektivo Labs.

Proposals for funding these three entities will follow separately.

# Detail

For reference, please see below descriptions of the individual line items.

## Annual Secretary Fee

Under Cayman Law, a foundation company must at all times have a secretary who is a 'qualified person' (i.e. a person licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services). The secretary has a duty to ensure that the company complies with applicable Cayman Islands legislation governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.

Neither the secretary fee nor the registered office fee includes the preparation of minutes and resolutions. The Foundation will prepare these for typical matters but might seek assistance from Campbells if complex matters arise.

These fees are due in January each year.

## Registered Office and Registrar of Companies fees (via Campbells Corporate Services Cayman)

Annual registered office and registrar fee – US$2,915.12, which consists of:

- Registered Office fee of US$ 1,495.00

- Beneficial Ownership Reporting and Register Maintenance Fee of US$225.00

- Economic Substance Notification Fee of US$125.00

- Registrar Annual Return Fee of US$853.66

- Supplementary Registered Office License Fee of US$91.46

- Sundry Disbursements of US$125.00

Includes:

- providing the registered office and registered agent

- maintaining the statutory registers

- preparation and submission of annual returns

- filing economic substance notifications

- maintaining the UBO register and reporting on the same

These fees are due in January each year.

## Additional Campbells Corporate Services costs

Any legal advice that may be requested from time to time will be charged on a time spent basis. Any additional corporate requests (for example, requests for certificates, certified documents, updates to registers, filing changes, mail forward, etc – these are all in addition to the annual fees) will also be charged separately.

## Governance/Supervisory Services

### Non-Executive Director and Supervisor Responsibilities

Under the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.

“Supervisor”, for a foundation company, means a person, other than a member, who under the foundation company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.

The non-executive director responsibilities are:

* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors
* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation
* To work with the wider board of directors to:
  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;

  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate
* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate
* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission
* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary
* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director
* Set the tone to involve the Balancer ecosystem in developing long-range programs to support and increase all types of contributions to Balancer projects
* Set the tone to harmonize the ecosystem working with the board, the service providers, and projects and adjacent foundations to find opportunities to collaborate and reduce confusion.

### Community Board Member duties

The Directors have ultimate responsibility for the management of the Foundation. In particular, the Director’s responsibilities will include:

* complying with all reasonable requests, instructions and regulations made or given by the Board (or by any duly authorized committee thereof) and give to the Board such explanations, information, and assistance the Board may reasonably require

* attending all meetings of the Board in person or by video/phone; provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary, as applicable, with reasonable advance notice; and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances;

* bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO, strategy, policy, resources, performance, and regulatory matters;

* providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, adherence to terms set forth in the Articles;

* planning, developing, and enhancing the future strategic direction of the DAO

* sharing responsibility with the other director(s) of the Company for the effective management of the Company

### CEO/Management duties

The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Foundation, which includes the following roles:

1. Liaising with the board on all budgets, project proposals, and matters particularly as it relates to service providers including the BVI subsidiary

* Reporting to the board in a timely manner on all matters of importance including financial status, funding projections, policy setting, planning, program operations, employee matters, and the long-term health of the ecosystem.

* Setting up and administering the Foundation’s bank account
* Setting up and managing token custodian

3. Involving the board, ecosystem participants, service provider staff as needed in developing organizational goals, a strategic plan, and projections for supporting the Balancer mission through service providers (Orb Collective Inc and BVI subsidiary) and the community.

* Overseeing vendors & others involved in actively seeking software and product developments and funds as needed.
* Ensuring that the Balancer projects delegated to service providers and the ecosystem have clear objectives that are within the scope of the resources and mission of the Foundation.
* Overseeing the gathering, analysis, and reporting of data illustrating the work accomplished by service providers to manage performance and deliverables
* Reviewing program evaluation results and developing and executing strategies for continual improvement.

4. Compliance

* Responsible for all necessary filings, responses to inquiries, management of AML Compliance vendor, and other Cayman Foundation compliance and risk-related matters

5. and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation.

## Legal Counsel

The Foundation may from time to time require advice on matters of Cayman law. It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item. We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter. For clarity, this refers to the legal team rather than the corporate services team.

## Self Insurance

It is typical for an organization to obtain insurance to protect itself against the legal, regulatory and operational risks, as well as to protect the directors and officers from personal liability for carrying out their duties. We have not seen reasonable insurance for organizations of this nature in the market, hence the need to self-insure.

We are asking for $500,000 based on the costs of defending Balancer in the event of a regulatory inquiry, class action or other lawsuit or vulnerability to the ecosystem. The self-insurance is based on recent DeFi matters within the last 12 months which have cost on average $100,000 monthly to defend. It is important to note, that we have excluded any reserve for payment of damages, fines, or impact on users.

Since this is a reserve and not an expense, the Directors may assess in the future that a lower reserve amount becomes sufficient and propose changes to the DAO. We are asking that the DAO bookmarks these funds to hold for self-insurance.

## Bank Fees

The Foundation is working to establish a bank relationship that we are advised could take approximately 6-8 weeks once the application is complete and submitted. This line item is an estimate/placeholder for monthly fees

## Accounting Software

Estimate for monthly software subscription fees.

## Domain hosting, email document management solution

The team behind TagTech combines experienced SoFi users with experts in business and blockchain technology, aiming to improve upon the existing SoFi ecosystem.
> 
> 
> TagTech stands out by offering practical solutions to common problems:
> 
> 
> - Scalability: We built a dynamic bonding curve system that lets creators split their social tokens, called Tags. TagSplits create new bonding curves with double the Tags in circulation and half the Tag price, giving creators the power to scale their communities.
> 
> 
> - Creator freedom: Creators are the heartbeat of any SoFi platform, and they deserve more freedom and control. That’s why at TagTech we champion self-custody, so creators own their private keys and assets. This also empowers us to easily build features like TagTransfer and token reward systems to reward creators for their contributions.
> 
> 
> - Sniping bots: To combat sniping bots while also giving creators more freedom of choice, we added a launch feature that gives creators complete control over their Tags. Creators can choose from three options: Quick Launch for instant sales, Initial Tag Offer (ITO) for fans to determine their Tag value via an auction, or Set Starting Price by buying Tags of themselves before anyone else.
> 
> 
> We believe that creators should have the freedom to choose what their Tag value should be.

690,"# PancakeSwap Welcomes Tranchess to Syrup Pool!


CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from Tranchess, a chess-themed decentralized finance (DeFi) asset management platform.



# The Syrup Pool:
Stake CAKE tokens to earn CHESS  tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 740,740 CHESS
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start block:** 9082800 (approx. 5am UTC on July 12th)
- **Finish block:** 10810800 (approx. 5am UTC on September 10th)
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.4286 CHESS


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.


# The Farm:
In order to host the CHESS Syrup Pool, we will need to provide a CHESS-USDC farm that will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours and then 0.5x CAKE rewards after that. 


# What is Tranchess?

[Tranchess](https://tranchess.com//) is a chess-themed DeFi Asset Management and derivatives trading protocol. The protocol seeks to provide a risk/return matrix from a single main fund, known as QUEEN, which tracks a specific underlying crypto asset. 

Launched on BSC on June 24th, its first fund allows BTC holders to earn extra yield via QUEEN creation. In addition, the fund attempts to serve a variety of clients with different risk tolerances-- users may split QUEEN into BISHOP, a USDC-denominated low-risk tranche, and ROOK, a leveraged tranche for BTC exposure. CHESS is Tranchess’ governance token.

Tranchess’ seed-round investors include Three Arrows Capital, Spartan Group, Binance Labs, LongHash Ventures, IMO Ventures etc.

Any other CHESS token will be a scam and will result in a financial loss for users. Do not buy tokens from any other token address. Always verify the token address before purchasing tokens. If you receive airdrops from another address for CHESS tokens, they will be rotten tokens (but not the cool kind!), and we advise you to ignore them.",neutral
691,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal presents a platform powered by ApeCoin that empowers community members on Otherdeed islands to form and manage as DAOs. The main feature of the platform is a set of tools that enable community members to easily build, connect, and interact with one another as they manage their islands together.

Through the platform, community members can find statistics and information on their desired islands. The platform also serves as a marketplace/aggregator that facilitates the process of finding and becoming a part of an island with other community members who share the same interests and goals.
Overall, the platform’s primary focus is on providing tools for DAOs, with the marketplace/aggregator feature serving as a secondary aspect that supports the formation and management of island communities. 

#### OVERALL COST 

$48,000 equivalent in $APE
~$2,240 will be the base cost for hosting services for the first year.

692,"hello buddies,

on this proposal I would like to suggest that we should use some of the fees collected in every prediction game to reward players.


Every weeks we should rewards players that made the biggest bets, the most bets, or that win the biggest bags because it will make an incentive for more players to come and play to prediction.

I think that we should dedicate from 10 to 25% of the collected fees to make a reward pool for players to make them come and play to prediction again and again.

Prediction is already a good game on pancakeswap and it will soon be deployed on more blockchain, but do you imagine it's fully potential if you start to rewards the players because they use the game? damn it's a killer app.


ALSO : we could rewards randomly 50 players/a day with little prize because they just played to a game, maybe we could reach more daily players in PREDICTION aswell.

694,"**Summary:**

Xave Finance (pronounced “Save Finance”) aims to enable financial services companies (such as “fintechs” and neobanks) to leverage DeFi for actual use cases, such as real time remittance transfers and high yield consumer savings. Xave does this by building an FX accurate AMM via a custom “FXPool” now and eventually a stablecoin lending market that shares liquidity with the Balancer V2 Vault via a BoostedFXPool.

**References/Useful links:**

Pasting links in reply due to new user limit

**Protocol Description:**

Xave has deployed its first custom pool - the FXPool - that brings FX accurate stablecoin exchange to the Balancer DAO. The first FXPool deployed is an xSGD:USDC pool.

**Motivation:**

StraitsX, the licensed issuer of fiat backed stablecoins xSGD and xIDR, will be helping to build use cases for this pool to enable liquid FX trades and eventually work towards instant, on chain cross border remittance between SGD-IDR and SGD-PHP. Ripple has famously tried to achieve this “on demand liquidity” but stablecoin FX is the true 10x improvement to traditional financial rails. This is especially true as stablecoin rails are able to offer end to end remittances at <1 % per transaction (if anyone is interested, we have a real world cost breakdown). This real world use case will bring sustainable fee generation via real economic activity to the BalancerDAO. Xave and StraitsX would like to work with the BalancerDAO to incentivize this initial pool with BAL rewards towards a real world use case in DeFi.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** 
Governance will be done via snapshot for now. Later on Xave's own ve governance structure will be deployed (forked from veBAL). Current admin of the XSGD:USDC FXPool is the team's ops 3/5 multisig 0x74042CE43D1e74FF5627B1e9ff2ee950251b5Db4 (Polygon), until the community is ready to take on ownership of the Xave protocol. 

2. **Oracles:** 
The xSGD:USDC FXPool utilizes a Chainlink oracle to allow FX accurate swaps for a predetermined range of the bonding curve. Beyond this range (called the “beta region”), LP ratio then dictates the price of trades. At this point, arbitrageurs are incentivized by significantly cheaper fees to trade the pool back to the “beta region” where FX price is followed. LPs are also incentivized to keep liquidity in the pool especially while it is outside the “beta region”, due to existing parameters that yield much higher fees charged to traders swapping the pool away from the “beta region”. See reply for linked docs to learn more

3. **Audits:** 
https://docs.xave.finance/contract-audits/v2-final-audit

4. **Centralization vectors:** 
⅗ operations multisig that owns contracts until contracts are “battle tested” and community is ready to takeover

5. **Tokens:** 
xSGD is an asset backed stablecoin, fully collateralized and issued by StraitsX - a licensed and regulated Singaporean entity by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)

USDC is an asset backed stablecoin issued by Centre
 
6. **Value:** 
This pool consists of the first native POS XSGD issued token by its' issuer https://www.straitsx.com/sg who will concentrate liquidity for real world use cases dependent on capital efficient on chain FX to support cross border settlement in the Southeast Asian region ++.

695,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

Firstly, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to farms – the per block allocation to Farms and Lottery will remain at [**3.75 CAKE/block**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/Qme8aLLxh7UeAmiAxcUie7FWvSrBYdmNMFtHhGdMTFEFKX).

Importantly, the purpose of these proposals is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. In other words, redistributing farm rewards from the farms mentioned below will boost APRs for all other farms. 

By boosting APRs for higher-performing farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more capacity to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

title: [ARFC] Gas Rebate for Recognized Delegates
author: @lbsblockchain, @MarcZeller Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
created: 2023-05-31
---

## Abstract

This ARFC introduces a mechanism for reimbursing gas fees to recognized delegates who vote on-chain on Aave.

## Motivation

As Ethereum gas fees continue to rise, the cost of on-chain governance for delegates has proportionally increased. This ARFC proposes a rebate system for these gas fees, aiming to incentivize active engagement and cultivate a more diverse voter base.

Rebating delegates for their participation offers several benefits:

- Encourages more active engagement from the delegate community by eliminating the disincentive to vote, leading to better decision-making for Aave.
- Fosters a more diverse voter base, including student organizations, by reducing the barrier to entry for voting. This creates a more open and collaborative delegate ecosystem, driving participation.
- Helps retain top delegates to foster the growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being an excellent Aave delegate should not result in a net cost to the delegate due to ever-increasing gas costs.
- Can be achieved at a relatively low cost. We also propose measures to reduce the administrative burden for Aave.

## Specification

### Claiming Process

Every quarter, an ARFC will be proposed (with the current one being the first) to publish an AIP reimbursing gas fees spent by recognized delegates.

These gas fees are determined by an open-source script written by @JosepBove, which allows anyone to generate a JSON file of recognized delegates' gas spending.

This script can be run and verified by any community member to approve the amounts distributed to recognized delegates.

Once a consensus has been reached on an ARFC, an appointed Governance Facilitator will submit an AIP to transfer aWETH to the delegate's address. We initially propose that the Aave Chan Initiative serves as the Governance Facilitator.

### Gas Rebate Token

We propose that the Gas Rebate Token be wETH.

## Proposed reimboursement

**Protocol Description:**

> Rocket Pool ETH (rETH) is a token that represents liquid staked ETH on the Beacon chain. As this staked ETH earns a yield the price of rETH increases to reflect that.

**Motivation:**

Recently Rocket Pool made a [proposal for Optimism incentives](https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x219e6f3cc726c24e7eb100959abea6cc3a5c24a24ffec3072a7784d33f030096) that would see the majority allocated to our deployment on Optimism. Additionally, the rETH pool on Ethereum is one of our most profitable pools in terms of fees earned per dollar of emissions. More rETH liquidity on Balancer should have a positive impact on Balancer's revenue generation and I expect liquid staked ETH to be quite popular on L2's. This pool is our first step towards capturing this new market.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Please see this [guide](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1) which outlines Rocket Pool's DAO structure. 

2. **Oracles:** This pool will rely on a rate provider which has been deployed to Optimism [here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x658843BB859B7b85cEAb5cF77167e3F0a78dFE7f#readContract). 

3. **Audits:** See [here](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-4-2635c44e4f7e).

4. **Centralization vectors:** Rocket Pool is a [protocol for decentralized and trustless ETH2 staking](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd).

5. **Market History:** See [coingecko page](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth).
 
6. **Value:** It is our goal to make this the highest TVL pool for rETH on Optimism. Once we have the new weighted pool factory we will create additional pools with rETH that will help increase it's usage on Optimism, thus creating more swap fee revenue in addition to the protocol fee we apply to rETH's yield.",neutral

700,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/fdt-weth-80-20-gauge-nested-pool-consideration/2954)

**Summary:**
The FIAT DAO community is proposing the following pools be given a veBAL gauge:

* [FDT/ETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x2d344a84bac123660b021eebe4eb6f12ba25fe8600020000000000000000018a)
* *FDT/OHM-ETH-DAI*
* *FIAT/staBAL3*

Note that while the FDT/ETH pool has been set up already by the FIAT DAO community, the other pools, as they are nested pools, require deployment support from the Balancer team which is underway at the time of posting this proposal. 

All pools should be deployed at the time, or shortly thereafter, when voting for this proposal starts ($FIAT launch is imminent). If need be, the two nested pools can be a separate proposal.

**References/Useful links:**

* See [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/fiatdao) due to forum link restrictions for new members

**Protocol Description:**

The FIAT protocol is a DeFi-native repo market solution for providing liquidity to holders of fixed income assets. It allows users of apps like Element Finance, Notional Finance, and Yield Protocol to bring their proofs of liquidity to the protocol in order to collateralize a debt position in $FIAT, a stable value asset. Our v1 has just launched, and it’ll look and feel familiar for users who have previously minted DAI, RAI, or MIM. By utilizing proven stablecoin mechanisms, the protocol is able to offer competitive borrowing power to holders of such collateral assets, allowing them to releverage fixed yields or meet current liabilities as the locked assets mature.

$FDT is the governance token associated with FIAT DAO. In its current iteration, $FDT confers voting power for users to participate in decision-making around protocol parameters. We are currently underway with an implementation of a v2 specification in which $FDT allows users to gauge behind supported collateral types in order to allocate a protocol backstop and inform algorithmic interest rates. We anticipate that the 80/20 FDT/ETH BPT will be the primary governance power-conferring asset in the updated DAO architecture.


**Motivation:**

FIAT DAO has expressed its desire to become a material player in veBAL governance going forward, as can be seen by a forum discussion accessible via the Linktree above. To achieve this, we are willing to commit DAO funds for the acquisition of voting power and the bribing of existing veBAL participants. For such strategies to have the greatest impact, we are keen to deepen $FDT secondary liquidity. Acquiring a veBAL gauge for the FDT/ETH pool, as well as for the FDT/OHM-ETH-DAI pool, will allow the DAO to move over existing protocol owned liquidity and engage in the Hidden Hand marketplace. As FIAT DAO proves itself a reliable partner to the Balancer ecosystem and the FIAT protocol gets more time in the wild, we hope to be in a position to conduct a DAO token swap at some point in the future as well.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** FIAT DAO is a completely on-chain organization, with no corresponding real world entity in place. The FDT token has been given away for free since November of 2021, and a DAO smart contract architecture has been live since December 2021.

2. **Oracles:** $FDT is a standard ERC-20 DeFi governance token that comes with the volatility inherent to the sector. $FIAT is a DAI-like asset that will come to be backed by less liquid derivatives, but at the moment only supports collateral types with existing secondary markets.

3. **Audits:** Audits of our protocol and our collateral oracle system can be found in the Security repo within our Github (again, see Linktree).

4. **Centralization Vectors:** $FDT holders determine which assets are supported as collateral and the parameters associated with each.

5. **Market History:** $FDT has been transferable since November 2021. It has struggled with liquidity due to a removal of liquidity incentives in February 2022 and routing issues on Uni v3 due to an unsupported OHM pairing.

702,"#### ABSTRACT

The DAO’s operations rely on the Ape Foundation, which serves as a steward for ApeCoin by empowering the community to lead the DAO and helping to execute its vision. The terms of the Foundation’s relationship with the DAO were established on a six-month basis in AIP-1. That six-month period will conclude on September 30, and absent any alternative process for continuing the DAO’s operations, will bring with it the risk that the DAO falls into a vulnerable period during which it lacks actionable operational procedures. This AIP proposes a three-month extension of the terms laid out in AIP-1 to (1) provide time for the development of a proper and thorough Ape Foundation election framework and process; (2) allow the community to better understand and ultimately engage with whatever process emerges; and (3) enable the DAO to continue functioning coherently beyond September 30.

705,"### [ARC] Add support for the FRAX stablecoin on Aave V3 Markets (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche).

#### Summary
FRAX is the inventor and first fractional stablecoin that uses a hybrid of algorithmic and collateralized mechanisms to stay on price target. FRAX is currently the #7 largest stablecoin by market cap (2.7B) according to Coingecko. FRAX has also never lost peg a single time in its 15 months of existence (defined as more than 1 cent price deviation on each side).

FRAX currently has the largest Curve pool on Ethereum mainnet with almost $3B in liquidity and is a Uniswap top 10 token. Additionally, FRAX has already been successfully lent out on Aave v2 on ETH mainnet for many months and is a popular borrowable stablecoin with no issues of unpegging or economic problems.

FRAX is also already deployed natively on Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche where Aave V3 resides (as well as 11 other chains making FRAX the most cross-chain native stablecoin on the market).

#### Risk Parameters
Network: Polygon, Avalanche & Fantom Aave V3

V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 5% reserve factor
V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 5% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling
#### Specifications
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
Sam Kazemian is the Founder of Frax Finance

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
See summary

3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
Frax being a decentralized stablecoin is a good fit to be used as borrow assets as an alternative to currently existing stablecoins supported by the Aave Protocol.
With V3 emode, FRAX is a great fit to join a stablecoin emode that will both have potential to increase Aave & FRAX volume while contributing to the stability of the FRAX asset. Additionally, FRAX can use its Lending AMO (similar to Maker’s DAI Direct Deposit Module) to mint protocol controlled FRAX to be lent out on Aave markets. FRAX already does this with an Aave Lending AMO on ETH mainnet to great success. We can commit to deploying similar Aave Lending AMOs to Aave v3 after FRAX is listed.

4. How is the asset currently used?
FRAX is a decentralized stablecoin minted in a permisionless way by users of the frax.finance protocol, FRAX is currently being LP’d in deep liquidity pools on stableswap+AMM protocols such as Uniswap V3, Solidly, Curve (4Pool), and others.
5. Emission schedule
FRAX is a stablecoin and mintable/redeemable so it does not have a governance token emission schedule.
6. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig?
There is a multisig which can operate certain AMO contracts but cannot in any way change users’ FRAX balances, cannot freeze or pause any user’s funds, and cannot in any way alter the behavior of the protocol or sweep/rug collateral or value. There are no FRAX whitelists/blacklists in any capacity as it is entirely a bearer asset/decentralized exactly like DAI.

7. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)
Market Cap: ~$2.7B
24h Volume: ~$50M
Volatility: stablecoin (extremely low)
Exchanges: Curve, SushiSwap, Uniswap v3, Fraxswap, QuickSwap, Saddle, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, Solarbeam, TraderJoe, and Rose
Maturity: Launched 12/20/20
FRAX token (global view)

Date of deployment: Dec 20th, 2020
Number of crosschain token holders: 25,000+

709,"## Proposal Summary

Following Uniswap’s successful deployment on the Scroll testnet, the Scroll team is proposing that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll's upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official deployment.

Point of Contact: [ Lea Schmitt, E-mail: lea@scroll.io]

## Overview of our Proposal

We propose that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll's upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official, canonical deployment. Uniswap V3 has already been deployed to Scroll’s testnet, and the Uniswap router has processed over 1.8M transactions there.

* Scroll is a bytecode equivalent zk-rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum.
* Scroll is an open-source project developed in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation Privacy and Scaling Explorations organization. It was built with the community, for the community.
* Our community ethos and vision are aligned with Ethereum. We are committed to a secure, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and efficient future that Ethereum offers through our plans to decentralize Scroll sequencers and provers.

We propose that Uniswap will showcase this by integrating Scroll into its user interface.

## Motivation

Uniswap being deployed on multiple Ethereum L2s is integral for encouraging competition and diversity of technical solutions to scale Ethereum. We believe that Uniswap's community and the ecosystem that Scroll strives for are closely aligned. Both projects are building trustless, decentralized, and secure financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone, regardless of merit or location. Deploying to Scroll offers many benefits, including significant user savings, an expanded user base, capturing the zkEVM market, and fostering L2 native innovation.

* This deployment positions Uniswap as an early mover and captures a rapidly growing market as the Ethereum ecosystem gradually shifts to zkEVMs.

* Uniswap on Scroll will integrate closely with Scroll's rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to deploying on our mainnet, and many are deployed on our testnet: AAVE, Lens, the Graph, Covalent, Safe, and Etherscan to name a few. Given the excitement around Scroll and current usage of our testnet, we expect hundreds of projects to deploy on our mainnet post-launch.

* Importantly, Uniswap on Scroll will propel L2 DEX innovation. We are on the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum L1. Scroll will bring new developers and ecosystem integrations to Uniswap.

## Success Criteria

Deployment of Uniswap on Scroll will:
* Increase Uniswap TVL, targeting $100M within two months of deployment Grow * Uniswap order volume
* Enable listing of new assets on Uniswap that are unique to Scroll

Moreover, Scroll will bring its dedicated and expanding developer community to Uniswap, thereby boosting the growth of Uniswap's developer community.

The best way to measure success for Uniswap on Scroll is to focus on TVL and transaction volumes. We think that Scroll can deliver an additional $100M of TVL to Uniswap within two months of launch.

## Protocol Security

ZK-Rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography rather than unreliable crypto-economics.

Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 canonical bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the roll-up mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than relayer-based bridges.

Security is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM, which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we are working with two external auditing companies to audit our bridge code, and we have an in-house security team that continuously reviews our codebase. 

We plan to launch with a timelock delay and a security council to control privileged functions and contract upgrades. Finally, shortly after launch, we will introduce distributed sequencer operators.

## Deployment

After the Temperature Check, we will move forward with deploying Uniswap V3 on our Scroll mainnet, following which we will submit the Governance Proposal with the addition of the deployed contract addresses. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is effortless to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take a few hours.

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the following Uniswap v3 contracts [to be filled in after deployment] to be deemed as the canonical Uniswap deployment on Scroll. This deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to reference the Uniswap v3 Factory contract on Scroll following the process outlined here: [Post-BSL Cross-chain Deployment Process & New Uniswap.eth Subdomain](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20878).

title: [ARFC] Safety Module - Polygon & Avalanche Coverage Update
author: @TokenLogic
created: 2023-09-03

---

# Summary

This publication proposes updating the Safety Module (SM) coverage across the various iterations of Aave Protocol on Polygon and Avalanche networks.

SM coverage is to be removed from Polygon v2 and Avalanche v2 deployments and extended to Avalanche v3.

# Motivation

With the continued migration of users from v2 to v3, this publication seeks to further encourage users to migrate by removing the SM coverage for Aave v2 deployments on the Polygon and Avalanche networks.

During 2023, the total market size on Avalanche and Polygon Aave v2 Protocol deployments has been trending lower. At the time of writing the total market size of Aave v2 on Avalanche and Polygon is $36.2M and $134.7M respectively. For comparison, the Aave v3 deployment on each network is $199.8M and $229.9M respectively. 

By removing SM coverage for Avalanche and Polygon v2 deployments, Aave DAO will no longer be providing coverage for the outdated iterations of Aave Protocol with exception of the Aave ARC deployment. By removing the SM coverage, users are further encouraged to migrate to v3.

The Polygon Aave v3 deployment is already covered by the SM whilst the Avalanche v3 deployment is not cover by the SM. This publication seeks to extend the SM coverage to include Avalanche v3. Therefore both v3 iterations are covered by the SM and v2 iterations are not covered on Polygon and Avalanche. 

For reference, at the time of writing, the following Aave Protocol deployments are covered by the SM:

* Ethereum v2
* [Ethereum v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2cbfeb5c5329c4d1720dbae4045386fceb2d2a9bd5b42a81cee47ea5c934f491)
* [Polygon v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7da4985b2d5b1cbe6bbc0992d5c86030cedef2013487e4b53b4244c315c90155)
* [Avalanche v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreiba2pdfwoesezgpedf37bjfgadxmaigavoulek5wayqb7f2tz6byy)
* [Aave ARC](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreieeyh6pbqwhgryo6v67oxlmnfhaptrgkc3u7y6bvz2y3jdkxgrrh4)
* [Polygon v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7da4985b2d5b1cbe6bbc0992d5c86030cedef2013487e4b53b4244c315c90155)


# Specification

It is important to note based upon the current implementation of the SM, an adhoc AIP is required to implement a Shortfall Event.

The following Snapshot votes will be created to enable granular voting:

* Extend SM Coverage to Avalanche v3
* Remove SM Coverage for Polygon v2
* Remove SM Coverage for Avalanche v2

Upon conclusion of the Snapshot vote, if approved, SM coverage will be removed/extended to the respective market.

There is no need for an AIP to implement this upgrade.

712,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

First, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to farms – the per block allocation to Farms and Lottery will remain at [**3.75 CAKE/block**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/Qme8aLLxh7UeAmiAxcUie7FWvSrBYdmNMFtHhGdMTFEFKX).

Importantly, the purpose of these proposals is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. In other words, redistributing farm rewards from the farms mentioned below will boost APRs for all other farms. 

By boosting APRs for higher-performing farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more capacity to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

Proposal Summary

This is a proposal to enable an svETH/wstETH gauge on Balancer at:

https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xdedb11a6a23263469567c2881a9b9f8629ee0041000000000000000000000669

Incentivization Strategy

We will adopt a two-pronged incentivization strategy.

We will directly stream rewards to Aura, so that Balancer LPs can maximize yields. We will also bribe Hidden Hand for additional votes to reward our pools.

The bribes will be paid in wETH.

Rewards streamed to Aura will be paid in the form of either our reserve-based utility token, VEC, or in the form of psVEC. psVEC is the yield-boosted version of staked VEC (sVEC) that has been wrapped into a Pod on Peapods Finance to deliver increased rewards.

You can read more about VEC in our Protocol Description below.

Protocol Description

vETH is DeFi’s first Liquidity Position Derivative (LPD), introduced by Vector Reserve.

svETH is the staked version of vETH, which users receive when they stake their tokens to earn additional rewards.

LPDs, or Liquidity Position Derivatives, are a never-before-seen asset class, capturing the yield from various LSTs and LRTs in a diversified fashion - while maximizing the ways to earn yield from each of them.

vETH can be minted using any approved asset on our dApp, and staked to earn yield from the following sources:

1. Staking and Restaking gains from holding LSTs and LRTs

2. LP fees from pairing these assets on various DEXs

3. Upcoming Superfluid Staking: The process of restaking liquidity positions on EigenLayer to earn additional yield. When this feature of EigenLayer goes live, we aim to be the market leader with a large treasury of LST/LRT-based LP positions backing vETH.

This approach allows us to generate best-in-market yield, giving vETH holders an advantage over holding standard LSTs or LRTs.

Holders can then stake the vETH on the Vector Reserve dApp to receive svETH and earn additional rewards.

Our reserve-based utility token, VEC, has a symbiotic relationship with the vETH token. While vETH generates value for the Vector Reserve, being a great source of treasury revenue, VEC is emitted to generate liquidity for vETH pairs across multiple DEXs - ensuring the product remains competitive in all areas. Every VEC token is backed by assets within the Vector Reserve, which grow from a share of yield generated by vETH as well as LP positions acquired through bonding.

With over $30m TVL accumulated across vETH and sVEC since launch, Vector Reserve is pioneering the next stage of the liquid restaking revolution.

Motivation

The Balancer vETH/wstETH gauge will play an important early role in incentivising liquidity providers to help with the process of bootstrapping initial liquidity. It will then serve as an important source of liquidity for svETH on an ongoing basis, supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.

Centralization Vectors: We have a small engineering team, with one lead engineer, but plans and funds are in place to scale as needed. The treasury is currently controlled by the multisig wallet.

Market History: Vector Reserve and vETH minting launched along with svETH staking on Thursday 25th January 2024. Since then Vector TVL has rapidly accumulated over $40m in TVL. There have been no major volatility events attached to svETH since launch.

Value: We believe in migrating the majority yield pool to wherever the majority of user provided LP is. Therefore, if the Balancer pool proves very popular for our community, it is very likely that we will support it to become the primary source of liquidity.

Based on [updated whitelist](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this proposal is to increase PERP from cap 1 to cap 2. PERP currently has 12.8M in liquidity

**What is PERP**
Perpetual is a new project that could bring a lot of trading volume to balancer. They provide perpetual futures contracts that are based in USD. This is different to protocols such as dydx where the base token may be in ETH or a native token traded - this is a massive differentiation point given a lot of the large trading volume exchanges such as Bitmex, binance and deribit denominate in USD.

The PERP token is planned to have distributions back to token holders through a percentage of trading fees which provides a mechanism to encourage trading volume",bullish

Set Borrow cap to 4.6 Million


Proposal: remove the borrow cap on the cCOMP market.

On last Wednesday’s Community Call (I tried and failed to record the call…next time) we discussed removing the cCOMP borrow cap of 100k COMP. The borrow cap was originally put into place to prohibit someone from using the market to borrow COMP, create a governance proposal, vote, and return the capital in seconds. After the upgrade to Governor Bravo and the installation of a review period, the governance process is significantly more cost-prohibitive for a borrower to obtain the necessary votes to meet the proposal threshold. As well, the review period gives users 48-hours to position their COMP holding for a vote, unlike Governor Alpha which used an instantaneous voting system. If a malicious user were to borrow the required COMP to meet the proposal threshold the community would have sufficient time to defeat their proposal.

Removing the borrow cap will help the COMP market develop. Trading firms (onchain and offchain) utilize money markets like Compound and Aave in their systems to borrow assets and particularly ones that are not abundant in supply in traditional borrow/lend services like BlockFi, Genesis, Nexo, and Celsius. It is helpful for everyone if spot and futures markets are efficient.

Next Steps: Changing the borrow cap does not require a traditional governance proposal since caps are controlled by the community multisig. The multisig holders follow the direction of the community. Below is a 7-day poll for removing the borrow cap on the cCOMP market. If you vote “YES” you think the borrow cap should be removed. If you vote “NO” you do not think the borrow cap should be removed. If the poll revolves to “YES” after the 7-day period the multisig holders will remove the borrow cap.",bullish
718,lets burn the tokens that are not circulating?,bullish
719,"I will start by looking at the big picture: 
1)	Cake wants to have liquidity, that’s a key goal for their business (The total Volume Locked). 
2)	Cake wants to have a strong burning rate, to be able to acheive a deflationary tokenomics model. 
3)	Every business that initiates an IFO on Pancake, wants to achieve 3 things a) Raise Funds, b)Growth of adoption, and c)Retaining their customers (to grow)

There are 25 Pancake Bunnies(PB) NFT types in this collection. We will adopt a points system that will be used to achieve the goals we mentioned above without sacrificing the tokenomics. We will use the most common PB as the baseline (Sleepy). This one has a total of 216,980. We will then give Sleepy 216,980 points, 1 point for every Sleepy NFT held. We will give every other PB type the same points, but with a different distribution, based on a weighted rarity system. For example, every Lottie NFT holder will get 12 points for every one they hold (Because it is 12x rarer than Sleepy). Same all the way up to The Baller, where every holder will get 5,166 points for every Baller held. The total points here will be 4,556,580. The good thing here is that it’s a points system, so this could scale if Pancake releases more NFTs in the future, using the same methodology I explained above. 

Now, let us assume a new token wants to make an IFO on PC (lets call it Bazabizo Token). They will use the same public sale mechanism + Private sale (with Squads NFTs as an enabler). However, the problem here is that users dump the tokens right after the IFO for an immediate profit. Now, the Bazabizo business gets the initial funding, but they lose a lot of users (because they sold early). I know that PC offers farms for that token, but then because a lot of dumping is happening, the price is very volatile, and users remove the liquidity because they are afraid of impermanent loss. If we enable an accelerated returns Farm for this token based on points, everyone wins. 

For example, we make an “Enhanced” farm for Bazabizo-BNB, and it yields 1% additional APY every week, until lets say 6 months. Users will need 1 point for every $1/week in that farm. So, if you put $10,000 in that pool and you have 50,000 points, you will be allowed to stay in there for 5 weeks, then auto-removed. You will get the LP tokens, that you could then use to farm in the ordinary pool. If this idea removed 10% of the selling pressure post IFO, then the Bazabizo business wins a lot of money! 10% less selling pressure could mean upto 50% price appreciation which means less impermanent loss, which means longer retention. On the other hand, if the token’s price is doing well, users in the “Enhanced” farm will be tempted to buy more PBs to get more points to stay in that Enhanced farm. Once users leave the enhanced farm, they keep their points always. Lastly, there are a lot of users who hold PB NFTs but they don’t participate in the IFO, they could then be tempted to buy the token to get into the Enhanced Farm. There are more than 200,000 holders of PB NFTs, that’s the best marketing for free a company like Bazabizo could have. 

The incremental yield given through the Enhanced Pool, shouldnt be large for PC. Its a maximum of ~$4.5M farm for 1 week at 1% incremental (in average, according to the total number of points as mentioned earlier). This shouldn't be more than ~$10K for every IFO (Happy to elaborate offline). On the other hand, if users like a certain Enhanced Pool, and then a new IFO is concluding, they will either leave the enhanced Farm (that they like) or buy more PB NFTs to participate in the Enhanced Farm for the new IFO. This will create volume. This mechanism, will create more volume for PB NFTs which reflects Cake burning. Simple Maths, every point costs ~$5 (the cost of Sleepy). So, if demand for the Enhanced Pool is increased to additional 500K points. That should reflect at least $2.5M trading volume no the PB collection, 2% of that is burned. Thats $50K! This is also a flywheel effect. The more Enhanced pools there is, the more users will buy PBs to enter, this means further volume and this could be accelerated. Every successful Enhanced Farm could bring 10-20% price appreciation to every point (Sleepy as a baseline), which means the burning associated with volume increases linearly with that, and so on. 

Ah, I forgot to say, that could be allowed for any given Farm, not only the newly formed IFOs. This could give tremendous added value. 

 Unfortunately, I am not allowed to add Excel sheets, that could've made it easier, but happy to do so offline.

721,"This proposal originally appeared on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799) and is faithfully reproduced here along with all proposed amendments.

# The Proposal
For the remaining two weeks of the [exchange gas reimbursement pilot](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705), expand the list of eligible tokens to include all whitelisted tokens (the same list that is eligible for BAL liquidity mining). The change would take effect starting at 00:00 UTC on Monday, February 8, and we would continue to allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy.

# Motivation
The pilot program has gone very smoothly so far, with 929 BAL being distributed to 441 addresses for the first week. Of these addresses, only 171 were LPs also participating in liquidity mining, meaning the other 270 were traders who gained the opportunity to participate alongside LPs in the ongoing distribution of BAL tokens. The second week of the pilot is not yet finished, but so far 1043 BAL are set to be distributed to 433 addresses, 342 of which are _not_ participating in liquidity mining. Only 86 reimbursed addresses are included in both weeks so far, meaning a total of 788 unique addresses have been or will be reimbursed.

For all of us in the Balancer community, the decentralized distribution of governance power  has always been a top priority. The liquidity mining program features an extensive list of over **400** eligible tokens and has been a key contributor to this decentralization, distributing BAL tokens to over **9,000** liquidity providers last week. In contrast, the gas reimbursement pilot so far has only included 5 eligible tokens in order to assess feasibility and reduce gameability at the outset.

But now that the basic, five-token version of the pilot has been validated, it is time to expand it to achieve the same degree of decentralization as the liquidity mining program. To ensure lasting robustness of the governance process, we need to get BAL tokens into the hands of as many Balancer users as possible; and that includes both liquidity providers and traders.

# Mechanics
The overarching mechanics of the gas reimbursement pilot would not change. Please see the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705) for details.

In lieu of the shortlist of eligible tokens included in the original proposal, we would use the existing [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json) used for liquidity mining. Swaps between any two of the tokens on the whitelist would be eligible for reimbursement of gas costs, with limits described in the original post and summarized here:

* Only transactions between an EOA account and the Balancer Exchange Proxy would be eligible. This roughly correlates to end users navigating the [Balancer Exchange UI](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap) and would not include DEX aggregators or most arbitrage bots.
* The maximum amount of gas to be reimbursed would be 100,000 units per swap, where there can be more than one swap in a single transaction (a swap is one leg of a multi-hop trade).
* The maximum gas price (in gwei) used would be the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block.
* Reimbursements would be made in BAL, not ETH, with the median BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko for the weekly period being used to convert.
* If the number of tokens to be distributed in a single week exceeds the 7,500 BAL budget, all reimbursements would be scaled down proportionally so that exactly 7,500 BAL are issued in total.
* Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.

# Amendment 1
If we detect any gaming of the reimbursement program, such as blatant wash trading, we would reserve the right to filter those addresses out of the distribution. We want this to be an opportunity for traders to safely utilize the Balancer Exchange without fear of having their reimbursements diluted by an attacker.",bearish
722,"Hi everyone,

As most of you are aware, the Tribe DAO has [applied for a veBAL allowlisting last month](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allow-tribe-dao-to-lock-vebal/2888), that was granted by the Balancer DAO, and 112,041 B-80BAL-20WETH tokens were successfully locked into veBAL last month.

The Tribe DAO also owns 252,865 B-70WETH-30FEI BPTs, a pool token that has a gauge, and we staked the BPTs in the gauge, earning BAL for around 3 weeks.

Contract used for vote-locking and gauge staking :

https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4EAc760C2C631eE0b064E39888b89158ff808B2

During our periodic reward harvesting 2 weeks ago, we noticed that our contract could not claim the BAL rewards associated with gauge staking, only the BAL and bb-a-USD associated with veBAL holding.

After discussion with the Balancer team, the issue was identified : BAL is not distributed through the gauge system, but through a BalancerMinter contract that is connected to the gauge system. The Tribe devs did a mistake, as we wanted to re-use the voting escrow and gauge management contracts we used for Angle Protocol, but it turns out that Angle Protocol distributes their ANGLE differently, directly through the gauges and not through a minter (like Curve and Balancer), so we did not have any capability to interact with the BalancerMinter. We tested and successfully claimed empty rewards on the gauge without revert, but just assumed no BAL were distributed because the gauge weight of the FEI pool was zero.

The Tribe DAO’s vote-locker has been deployed as an immutable contract, and it is now impossible to add the capability to interact with the BalancerMinter and claim the BAL rewards associated with gauge-staked BPTs.

As a result, the Tribe DAO farmed 34,344 BAL that will be forever unclaimable on the BalancerMinter.

We would like to ask the Balancer DAO to OTC these BAL tokens back to us (on [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5bb8F0253776beC6FF450c2B40f092f7e7f5b57)). We do realize that there is absolutely no obligation to do so on your part, and that the mistake was ours, but Balancer is a very strategic move for the Tribe DAO (even more so with the [FEI<>FRAX partnership](https://tribe.fei.money/t/frax-x-fei-stablecoin-alliance/4292) potentially coming), and these BAL will never enter circulation and will forever be unclaimable otherwise. The Tribe DAO will continue to renew its veBAL locking from the current contract, but we are going to deploy a new gauge staking contract [shortly](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/pull/799) (edit - deployed [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf53e251352683155898295569d77b8506ba00d80) behind [eip-1967](https://etherscan.io/address/0x66977ce30049cd0e443216bf26377966c3a109e2) proxy).

# Specification
The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction to the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling `grantRole` with the arguments:

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Launch Aave V3 on Kava EVM 

Author: [Various Kava Ecosystem Contributors]

Created: 2023-12-12

---

# Summary

KAVA in collaboration with PGov and Michigan Blockchain propose the integration of Aave V3 with KAVA. KAVA’s EVM compatibility and integration will be a crucial advancement for the Aave multichain vision. The integration will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Cosmos and enables Cosmos ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through KAVA

# Motivation

This proposal aims to be a starting point in the process of bringing Aave to the KAVA Ecosystem and aims to provide necessary details to the Aave community to consider the merits of KAVA integration. Kava has been building out the cornerstones of a solid DeFi ecosystem since mainnet launch in 2022. The key dexes in the ecosystem are Kinetix (a Uniswap v3 dex plus perpetual trading platform built by the Quickswap team from Polygon), WAGMI (protocol owned liquidity dex), and Equilibre (a ve3,3 dex). There are a few burgeoning lending protocols on the chain, but with the team’s plans to deprecate the existing leading lending protocol on the Cosmos SDK side, Kava Lend, there exists an incredible opportunity for a blue chip lending protocol like Aave to establish market dominance on the EVM side.

In addition to the market opportunity, the Kava ecosystem has an ongoing incentive program called the Kava Rise program which incentivizes protocol usage pro-rata based on TVL per protocol. Currently 1M Kava is being distributed per month to protocols pro-rata. Due to the proclivity for lending protocols to attract a significant portion of TVL in an ecosystem, Aave stands to earn the majority of these rewards. The current distribution of rewards is 1M Kava per month, and can increase pending governance approval as the ecosystem matures.

The Kava Foundation has committed to providing liquidity mining rewards of a minimum of 1M Kava guaranteed over the first year for the Aave community.

*Benefits of deploying on Kava*

With the KAVA integration, Aave gets additional markets with Market Cap of $740M, ~200M of locked liquidity, native assets like ATOM, USDT, WBTC and more. KAVA itself is connected well within the Cosmos ecosystem, thus the integration will also enable the cosmos community to plug its deep $60Bn liquidity to Aave through KAVA.

- Kava today is the 12th largest chain by TVL, and 9th by number of deployed protocols as per DefiLlama 2
- Kava is an EVM built on top of the Cosmos SDK, this also facilitates bringing Cosmos assets (like ATOM) natively onto the Protocol, which is not possible on other EVMs. AAVE has the opportunity to connect trading in the Cosmos and Ethereum.
- Kava is the largest of such an EVM chain with native Cosmos integration capabilities.

*Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment*

In addition, Kava has recently garnered a partnership with Tether, as Tether selected Kava to be the native USDT distributor across the Cosmos. In other words, if a user wants an IBC denominated USDT that’s natively issued by Tether, that USDT needs to originate from Kava. In just a few short months, there has been over $150M USDT natively issued on the Kava blockchain.

WETH is also available as an OFT on Kava via Stargate, and WBTC will soon be issued natively on Kava by Bitgo as well. This provides a plethora of native asset markets for Aave on Kava with deep liquidity.

Some other bluechip deployments on Kava include Curve Finance, Beefy Finance, and an upcoming deployment from Yearn Finance as well.

Kava’s latest partnership with Tether, Bitgo, LayerZero and other DApps mentioned above signify its steady commitment to provide a top of the line DeFi ecosystem to users.

One unique benefit of an Aave v3 deployment on Kava is that Aave would be able to open up Cosmos based markets like ATOM natively on the EVM, which is currently not available on any other chain. We believe this opportunity to open up the Cosmos world to Aave presents a significant opportunity for the community.

# Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:

The Kava Foundation has done a good job of managing its treasury in this recent bear market. Currently the treasury stands at ~360M Kava. The Foundation is happy to seed liquidity in initial markets with up to 50M Kava over the first year.

As mentioned previously, the Kava Rise reward program exists to reward protocols pro-rata based on the amount TVL each project has on a monthly basis. With the commitment to seed liquidity, and the market opportunity for Aave to overtake the soon-to-be deprecated existing Kava Lend protocol, Aave has a clear opportunity to establish TVL and market dominance within the Kava ecosystem, and thereby earn a significant portion of existing 1M Kava/month liquidity mining rewards.

In short, not only will Kava Foundation commit to seeding liquidity, but that seeded liquidity will also drive the flywheel of liquidity mining rewards for Aave users on Kava.

Regardless of TVL, at a bare minimum, the Kava Foundation will commit to 1M Kava in liquidity mining rewards over the first year for the Aave community. It is completely up to the Aave community how it wants to use these rewards.

*About Kava Rise Program*

Kava Rise is an on-chain reward program that rewards builders on Kava. Rewards are distributed monthly on a pro-rata basis on the amount of TVL each project has. The current reward distribution is 1M Kava per month. And this amount can change/increase based on governance as the ecosystem continues to mature.

725,"## Summary

A proposal to whitelist Connext, a trust minimized cross chain protocol, for V3 Portals on 6 chains: Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony - with credit lines for USDC ($2m on each chain), USDT ($1m on each chain) and ETH (40 ETH on each chain).

## Reasonale

[Connext](https://connext.network) is a network for **fast, trustless communication between chains and rollups**. It is the only interoperability system of its type that does this cheaply and quickly without introducing any new trust assumptions. Connext is aimed at developers who are looking to build bridges and other natively **cross-chain applications**.
To date, over $1.3b in transactions have crossed the network.

Our network of liquidity providers only works with native assets, or the most canonical representation of a wrapped asset.

With our [Amarok upgrade](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4), a series of improvements are coming for users, developers and liquidity providers (routers): the latest will be tasked with providing capital upfront to the users, while getting refunded within 30 minutes when the slower confirmation, coming from the [Optimistic communication protocol Nomad](https://blog.connext.network/optimistic-bridges-fb800dc7b0e0), is completed.

Users’ transactions get confirmed in seconds, LPs get rewarded with a fee on the transaction for their service.

**Portals are therefore a perfect match for Connext as our LPs will need and want to access immediate extra liquidity to fulfill transactions, and our new architecture allows for this operation to be completed via the protocol in a trust minimized way**.

## Technical Specifications

Connext is much more than a bridge, it’s an **interoperability protocol**: it allows to build cross chain applications without adding trust assumptions.
One of these applications are bridges, others could be cross chain NFTs marketplaces or cross chain governance portals.

**51 routers are currently providing $40m+ of liquidity.**
The highly capital efficient architecture of Connext allows for higher volume (and therefore higher returns) with less capital compared to other solutions in the space.
The system is currently working on a whitelist basis. Once the [NEXT token](https://blog.connext.network/whats-next-d3044de49397) is live, the whole network will be permissionless.

## How does it work?

This is an overview of the Amarok architecture that is currently on testnet and planned to go live in a few weeks:

![image](ipfs://QmZVvSsU5ra6vFvMiu82iMAieP1LFuS44EjsbLJVkeUj8N)

The new flow heavily utilizes Nomad (and eventually other localized messaging layers) for its security model. Routers front capital and execute calls for a user’s transaction, and claim against funds going through Nomad.


A full overview can be found [here](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4).

This model fits with the Aave Portals. This is how the simplified architecture integrating Portals will look like - credits to Delphi Digital for the image.

([Development progress deep dive](https://github.com/connext/nxtp/pull/1074)).

The logic for the execute and reconcile methods for the Aave portals has been completed and is ready for audit.

#### Is there a fee model for participants?
LPs currently take a 5bps fee from every transaction

726,"Summary

This is a request to the Venus Community for 18,000 USDC (~57,960 GRT assuming $0.3 per GRT and the remaining swapped to ARB to fund transactions). 

The USDC will be swapped for GRT and ARB and used to maintain the Venus Protocol’s subgraphs for 1 year starting June 2024. Venus Protocol is currently using subgraphs to provide protocol data to the Venus Protocol UI, landing page, security partners like Chaos labs, and tools like keeper bots and will continue to use The Graph for future projects, like multi chain governance. 

On June 12th, 2024 the hosted service will be fully upgraded to The Graph’s decentralized service thus requiring migration to the decentralized service. To make the migration easier Edge & Node has offered support including a month of sponsored queries and curation for 5 subgraphs.

A proposal for a follow-up distribution of 758’000 stable-coins from the Aave Collector to allow full withdrawals by aAMPL suppliers to Aave v2 Ethereum, consequence of the problem detected at the end of 2023.

 

## Motivation
In December 2023, a problem was detected on the AMPL custom reserve on Aave v2 Ethereum, causing an unexpected inflation of AMPL-related balances and supply, not following the intended design by the Ampleforth team.

After further analysis and remediation strategy, the Aave governance approved and executed a proposal on April 17th to provide approximately 300’000 USDC for aAMPL holders to claim. This was designed as an initial and interim distribution, with the sole objective of providing liquidity for users affected as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the service providers of the Aave DAO and the Ampleforth team completed further analysis for a final distribution proposal; this one.

 

## Specification
To fully understand the problem at hand and the rationale of this distribution, we recommend mandatorily reading its specification on https://governance.aave.com/t/ampl-problem-on-aave-v2-ethereum/15886/155, to make an informed decision.

 

In summary, this proposal recommends making claimable 758’000 stablecoins from the Aave Ethereum Collector, in addition to the already distributed 300’000 USDC, making a total of approximately $1,057,677.

Some key points output of the analysis are:

- Decisions when doing the analysis have been made to favor aAMPL holders, whenever it was subjective generally, but always trying to maintain objectivity on the expected dynamics of AMPL on Aave.
- Real returns of supplied AMPL on Aave have been recalculated from the freezing period until the expected execution time of the proposal (beginning of May 2024). This approach, compared to calculating from market inception, preserves four times more AMPL for users, maximizing welfare for AMPL suppliers.
- The previous analysis resulted in identifying a claimable amount of 351,579 AMPL as of December 16th, 2023, after rectifying highly evident artificial inflation within the 764,303 aAMPL total supply. As a reference point, debt levels were observed to be at 42,847 AMPL during that period.
- As further compensation for the time passed since December during which funds were not withdrawable, the latest on-chain rate is applicable on the 351’579 AMPL: 256% compounding for more than 4 months, which results in a total of 882’869 AMPL, or $1,057,677.
- Uniform 100% utilization from 16th December 2023 to the beginning of May 2024 is considered, disregarding the underlying rebases of AMPL. This also tries to heavily increase the amount received by aAMPL holders, as once again, debt levels are currently just 72K vAMPL, compared to the much greater compensation amount.
- Pricing claims at $1.198 price per AMPL, despite the price falling below and negative rebases accruing on the aAMPL supply since.
- Any holding by the Aave Collector contract is not included in the compensation, to increase the amount received by other aAMPL holders.
- Interest generated from the 300’000 available on 17th April to withdraw is discounted, as those funds are fully claimable by users.
- Minor adjustments may occur during the AIP stage but will not significantly impact the compensation amount.

The Ampleforth team agreed to compensate 40% of the total after proposal execution, as stated on https://governance.aave.com/t/ampl-problem-on-aave-v2-ethereum/15886/128, which will be done after Aave fully approves this distribution.

 

Regarding the technical details, the proposal will:

- Initiate a distribution campaign of the 758’000 stablecoins (or any other stablecoin recommended by Aave treasury service providers) on the Merkle platform, which has already been used for the initial interim distribution.
- Optionally, authorize any further technical update on the AMPL v2 Ethereum reserve to be done if required on the AIP stage.

 

## Disclaimer
This proposal was created by BGD Labs and Chaos Labs within their respective engagements for technical services with the Aave DAO. Its execution will depend exclusively on the decentralized Aave governance approving it.

 

## Next Steps
- In parallel with this Snapshot vote, preparing the final technical details of the AIP.
- If the Snapshot outcome is YES, escalate to the on-chain AIP stage.

## Background

The establishment of the Business Development Service Provider (BDSP) took place in Q1 2024 under [BIP-525](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-525-business-development-funding-proposal-q1-2024-and-retroactive-q4-2023-funding/5481) , with the intent of forming a dedicated working group focused on business development and growth-oriented activities. Initially, BIP-525 proposed a part-time 'trial period' for lipman's involvement, but lipman quickly assimilated into the team, assuming a full-time role almost immediately and driving impact for the DAO. Additionally, BIP-525 had anticipated json's phased exit from the Balancer BDSP in Q2, yet it is evident that json contribution in Q2 will continue to add value on a part-time basis.

During Q1, the primary goals for the BDSP included shifting BD responsibilities from json to lipman and integrating lipman into the Balancer ecosystem, encompassing the DAO team and external partner network. Simultaneously, the BDSP was tasked with assessing potential opportunities for chain expansion and pursuing applicable grants. These initial objectives were achieved, and the BDSP targeted much of its focus to protocol expansion and fostering partnerships quickly in the early stages of Q1. This proactive shift not only enhanced the BDSP's productivity in Q1 but also positioned Balancer for a highly productive quarter in Q2.

A BDSP update as of mid February can be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/business-development-sp-january-2024-update/5583). Other highlights in Q1 include (in no particular order):

* The [LRT tripool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a) reached $120m in TVL
* Evaluating and negotiating deals with multiple L2s for Balancer expansion: Metis, Scroll, Monad, BNB, Linea, X1, Mode, Injective, Sei, BoB, and more.
* Cultivating strong relationships with key LRT partners such as Renzo, Etherfi, Swell, Kelp, Vector Reserve, and others. These relationships are evident from TVL, ve8020 launches, and by partners telling us they only want to work with Balancer on new chains.
* Developing relationships with key industry players. A few examples include the defi leadership team at Base, Aave for GHO liquidity on Balancer, Trident/Paypal/Paxos for pyUSD, Paradigm, and many others
* Evaluating CCIP with Chainlink and the Maxis for easier partner onboarding
* Kicking off a multi-functional project team to revamp the partner onboarding process with a new UI and self-service features
* Securing [100% of Balancer’s vlAura](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x6b7042ca6b93fea257320f21fc4934ac27544dc4d07738761561c95db3bdeb8a) for the BDSP’s discretionary use.
* Launching a [ve8020 pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x0f9fdc4d883f6d85b68ce1b8b96aa706a3538e5b000200000000000000000675) with Vector Reserve
* Launching LRTs on new chains via Balancer
* Outreach and exploration of opportunities with projects across an array of functions. Some of the many examples include (in no particular order):
  * BoB (bitcoin L2)
  * Boost
  * Conduit.xyz
  * Ethena
  * Eclipse
  * Peapod Finance
  * Prisma
  * Inverse Finance
  * Magpie (LRT)
  * AlphaGrowth
  * pyUSD
  * EstateX
  * Restake Finance
  * Liquid Collective
  * Shadow
  * Stakestone
  * Milkyway
  * Puffer
  * And more

Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards: YES

Length of Engagement & Budget: 3 months (April 2024 - June 2024)

The biggest adjustment in the BDSP funding proposal is transitioning lipman from a part-time ‘trial basis’ status due to the limited budget originally allocated for Q1 before lipman was involved [[BIP-433](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xbdd578a51415c10d7d9f0fd3c80758edfa4a56b6720247bc9f1d33ec2b8bc0c3)] to a regular contributor in Q2 with FTE comp. Lipman’s compensation will include a combination of liquid tokens (USDC) and locked BAL to provide upside for the impact the BDSP is making on growth of the protocol. Json will continue to contribute on a limited, part-time basis including supporting lipman as needed.

* Lipman =
  * $12,500 USDC per month ($37,500 total for the quarter)
  * 2,114 locked BAL per month (6,342 BAL for the quarter)
    * ~$10,000 in USD value as of the 30 day TWAP $BAL price of $4.73 as of Mar 11, 2024
* Json = $2,000 USDC per month ($6k total for the quarter)

Impact on the Treasury

The Treasury wallets currently hold ~4.2M BAL. Funding the BDSP for Q2 2024 would cost around 0.15% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~0.60% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold ~5.78M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 0.25% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~1.00%.

## Retro Funding of Business Development of Q1 2024

As previously mentioned, the initial Q1 budget of $20k was established before lipman's involvement, with the intention of accommodating a part-time contributor. However, lipman surpassed this expectation and also significantly contributed to the quarter as an active, full-time participant. Lipman received $15k of the $20k budget during Q1 with json receiving the remaining $5k.

In light of Lipman's increased involvement and impact during Q1, a request is being made for an additional $17.5k in USDC. This amount, in addition to the $15k provided and a $5k bonus from the Q1 Maxi discretionary budget, is equivalent to the monthly USDC amount being requested for Q2 ($12.5k/mo).

Title: [ARFC]  Retroactive bug bounties proposal (pre-Immunefi)

Author: BGD Labs @bgdlabs

Date: 2024-01-09

---

## Summary

Request for bounties pending from before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi official bug bounty program, amounting a grand total of $86’500.

**The objective of this ARFC is to pre-authorise such payments, to be processed via an on-chain AIP**

## Motivation

Before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty program on [September 25th 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/325/), security reports by white hats where evaluated in an ad-hoc basis, proposing bounties/rewards following an approach like on [this proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077). That was not optimal, as there was no formal scope defined, or strict ranges of bounties depending on severity and impact.

Currently, every report is being processed via Immunefi and the rules of the Aave program, however, there were other reports submitted via other channel before that (usually security@aave.com). As these reports should be evaluated at time of submission for fairness, and outside of the Immunefi scope defined afterwards, we think it is a good idea to reward them separately and retro-actively outside the program.

## Specification

### Reports

First of all, we want to clarify certain aspects for the community:

- The proposed rewards and evaluation metrics follow the ones we did ad-hoc in the past [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077#clarification-on-evaluation-2), as we don’t think it is fair for the white-hats to apply the rewards ranges on the current Immunefi program and out-of-scope rules, as they were defined afterwards.
- In one of the cases, we recommended the white hat to submit the report via Immunefi, in order to have access to the mediation procedure of the platform. As this mediation process was finally requested by the white hat, Immunefi charges the corresponding fee of 10% of the amount, which we think is legitimate.
- At the moment, *we are not disclosing the full details of some of the reports*, because even if none of them create any risk for Aave now, one has dependencies with another report (not disclosed yet) and the other could increase risk to non-Aave entities.


### 1. Inconsistent validation on  Aave v2/v3

When calling `borrow()` with stable rate mode on Aave v2 and v3, one of the validations is that not more than a percentage of the total available liquidity can be borrowed at once.

However, `swapBorrowRateMode()` doesn’t validate the same, which is unexpected and could lead to more stable rate borrowings than intended.

It is important to highlight that this is not possible at the moment, with minting of stable rate disabled.


**Severity:  Low**

The issue didn’t create any immediate problem in the protocol, but overexposure to stable rate mode is not expected.

**Likelihood:  Certain**

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.

**Proposed bounty:** 10’000 USD

---

### 2. Inconsistent HF (Health Factor) behaviour swap borrow rate mode

When swapping borrow rate mode, the HF of an user is not validated, as debt should remain the same. However, under edge scenarios, the HF of an user could slightly change (by ~1 unit of lowest asset’s decimals).


**Severity:  No impact**

This is not a bug or creates any exploit scenario, but it is unexpected behaviour.

**Likelihood:  Certain**

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.

**Proposed bounty:** 5’000 USD

---

### 3. Price manipulation of asset listed on Aave

By executing a complex strategy (involving compromising the asset’s trusted infrastructure), it could be possible to inflate the price of one of the assets listed on Aave v2.

Even if this belongs more to the centralisation risk of the asset, and we don’t consider a bug of the protocol, it was taken into account for off-boarding consideration of the asset by risk providers of Aave, and we believe it is fair to reward retro-actively.

As this risk still exist on the asset itself and more protocols could be using it, even if we don’t really see any immediate risk, we will not be disclosing at the moment details of it, until the team applies extra measures.


**Severity:  Critical**

Being a price manipulation, the impact on the protocol would hypotetically be important.

**Likelihood: Not likely**

The attack involves compromising asset’s infrastructure (which would directly disqualify on the current Aave <> Immunefi program), together with extra techniques; so we consider it theoretically possible, but highly improbable.

**Proposed bounty:** 65’000 USD. Additionally, 6’500 USD as Immunefi fee.

## Next steps

If this ARFC is positive, afterwards we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal, releasing the funds to the corresponding addresses.",bullish

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Tooling Upgrade
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @defiJesus & @efecarranza
created: 2023-10-23

---

# Summary

The publication suggests that the Aave DAO contracts @TokenLogic to develop various smart contracts aimed at assisting in the management of the DAO's Treasury.

# Motivation

At present, the Aave DAO has a mechanism for bridging funds between Polygon and Ethereum using the [Aave Polygon-Mainnet ERC20Bridge](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-helpers/tree/master/src/bridges) via the shortExecutor. This contract was created by @efecarranza during their tenure at [Llama](https://governance.aave.com/t/update-on-aave-swapper-and-strategic-asset-manager-contracts/14522/3).

To ensure the Aave DAO's financial stability and the ability to transfer assets across different networks through the shortExecutor, it is crucial to establish equivalent contracts for other networks. One such scenario involves moving USDC from Avalanche to Ethereum, effectively extending the DAO's stable coin runway.

This publication recommends the development of the following tooling contracts:

1) Avalanche to Ethereum
2) Optimism to Ethereum
3) Arbitrum to Ethereum

Upon the creation of these contracts, they will become public goods within the Aave ecosystem. This means that anyone will have the capability to draft a payload for transferring the DAO's funds between various networks with minimal effort.

Once the Avalanche to Ethereum bridge contract is completed, TokenLogic intends to propose a fund migration to the Ethereum Treasury to support the ongoing financial stability of the DAO.

# Specification

TokenLogic is to create the following contracts:

1) Avalanche Bridge to Ethereum
2) Arbitrum Bridge to Ethereum
3) Optimism Bridge to Ethereum
4) Transfer Funds Avalanche to Ethereum

@BGDLabs is to review and approve these contracts.

# Funding

To facilitate the development and implementation of the previously mentioned contracts, this publication seeks the following funding:

**Funding Amount:** $12,430.00, to be paid in GHO.
**Delivery Schedule:** The estimated timeframe for completion is approximately 5 weeks, which includes the review by @BGDLabs (an estimated 2 weeks).

The deliverables will undergo approval by @bgdlabs to ensure their completeness. The Avalanche bridge contract will play a pivotal role in moving funds from Avalanche to Ethereum, thereby providing support for the DAO's financial stability.

The transfer of funds as per the approved amount will occur upon the successful delivery of the contracts. The Aave DAO is encouraged to vote on one of the following three options:

1) YAE
2) NAE
3) ABSTAIN

# Next Steps

1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will commence building the contracts.

The DAO is expected to uphold outcome of the Snapshot vote.

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Further Aave v1 deprecation strategy

Author: BGD Labs @bgdlabs

Date: 2024-01-09

---

## Summary
Approve further steps of Aave v1 off-boarding, to reduce operational overhead on deprecated Aave instances.


## Motivation
The Aave protocol v1 was released in January 2020 and eventually superseded by Aave protocol v2 in December on the same year.

While Aave v1 has been deprecated for a long time, some liquidity is still stuck on the protocol 1. Even if this instance is not covered by the Aave Safety Module, being part of Aave, it still is monitored and evaluated whenever development and/or security decisions are made.

This creates meaningful overhead for all involved development & security teams, which directly adds cost to the Aave DAO. Additionally, the architecture of Aave v1 is quite different to Aave v2 & v3, making it the most ad-hoc instance of Aave.

For the previous reasons, we think the community should evaluate approving extra off-boarding steps.


## Specification
To achieve a complete off-boarding of Aave v1, the following needs to be completed:

- All debt has to be settled, in order to allow liquidity providers on v1 to withdraw.
- All assets have to be withdrawn.

To minimise the impact on users we propose a phased approach, where each phase could last in the order of 1-3 weeks.

### Phase 1
In a first phase we recommend to upgrade the liquidation mechanism on the protocol in the following ways:

- It should no longer be possible to receive aTokens for liquidations (as the goal is to remove liquidity, not transfer it from user to user).
- It should be possible to liquidate healthy (collateralised) positions with a fixed liquidationBonus (e.g. 1%). This value should be small to not hurt borrowers, while still being big enough to incentivise liquidations. If this Temp Check is successful, we will confirm the number with risk providers., but 1% at the current moment would make the liquidation profitable for approximately 85% of the positions to liquidate.
- It should be possible to liquidate a entire position at once (currently on Aave v1 only 50% of a position can be liquidated).
- Interest rates should be lowered to the minimum, as the previously described always-enabled dynamics remove any need of utilisation dynamics.
- Remove flash loan fee, as there should not be extra incentives for liquidity providers.

### Phase 2
In a second phase we recommend increasing the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage.

The exact number must be chosen based on current market conditions to minimise user impact, but allow economical liquidations.

### Phase 3
Once the big majority of debt is repaid, we recommend to introduce a forced withdrawal mechanism. With forced withdrawals anybody could withdraw on behalf of any liquidity provider on Aave v1, with the funds received by the holder of the aToken.

It is important to clarify that further technical aspects on this should be analysed before executing this step, for example smart contracts receiving funds without triggering a withdrawal.

---

After all the Phases are finished, additional ad-hoc steps can be executed, like Rescue Mission for locked funds.


## Next Steps

If this TEMP CHECK is approved, we will proceed with an ARFC, with the final steps including feedback from risk service providers, and precise technical decisions.

Finally, AIPs will be created for the different phases.

743,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-balancer-labs-to-emergency-pause/2399).

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable a multisig controlled by Balancer Labs team members to control the Boosted Pools emergency pause mechanism during its first 3 months.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) have an emergency pause period which is **hardcoded at 3 months** from the time the factories were deployed. During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. **Funds can always be withdrawn by users** , even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.

Since gathering 6/11 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also **authorizing a Balancer Labs controlled multisig to pause the system** . The [BLabs Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B) will be controlled by a handful of team members at Balancer Labs. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Governance Multisig nor the BLabs Multisig will have any pause power.

An important distinction between the pause mechanism in Boosted Pools and that of previous pool types and of the vault is that Boosted Pools are not supposed to be unpaused. In practice, after a pool is paused users should withdraw assets from the pool and a new pool should be deployed. In the event that the pause mechanism must be triggered, Balancer Labs will commit resources to draw attention from liquidity providers to the fact that they must withdraw their funds.

## Specification

The Balancer governance multisig on Ethereum Mainnet ( `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` ) would submit a transaction to the Authorizer ( `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` ) in order to grant the following roles to a Multisig controlled by Balancer Labs ( `0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B` ):

1. the ability to call the `setPaused` function on pools deployed from the `AaveLinearPool` factory ( `0xD7FAD3bd59D6477cbe1BE7f646F7f1BA25b230f8` )
2. the ability to call the `setPaused` function on pools deployed from the `StablePhantomPool` factory ( `0xb08E16cFc07C684dAA2f93C70323BAdb2A6CBFd2` )

744,"This proposal is also on [Balancer's Forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-sourcecred-engagement-incentives/684) but has undergone minor edits to include the results of forum polls.

🔥_ 🔥 ([Fire Eyes DAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao/hello-world-e3c9a409ea49)) has been working with the Balancer team to develop governance mechanisms that complement the launch of Balancer V2.

At the end of 2020, we proposed [Governance Mining](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-governance-mining/554) to encourage community members and liquidity providers to participate in governance, and to compensate these people for doing so.

One piece to this incentive program is the implementation of a [SourceCred instance](https://balancer-labs.github.io/balancer-cred/#/explorer) to track contributions to the Balancer Community.

**This proposal looks to leverage SourceCred to distribute 50 BAL per week based on the Cred and Grain scores accumulated by users across both the [Balancer Forum](https://forum.balancer.finance) and the #governance channel in the [Balancer Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7hWw6Us).**

Community members will need to opt-in to this program to be eligible for rewards, with specifics on the process to be finalized pending acceptance of this proposal.

# Motivation
The introduction of ‘soft’ incentives around governance in [Maker](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-sourcecred-trial/2551) and [Index Coop](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/the-index-flywheel/447) have improved the quantity, quality and diversity of contributions.

We aim to empower these contributions in the Balancer ecosystem via a suite of governance incentive programs. The [GovFactor](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-govfactor/589) addresses the incentivisation of liquidity provider participation, and we believe that there is a much broader space for participation in the Balancer community from people and groups who may not have the capital to become LPs, or who otherwise choose not to do so.

# Specification
The [Balancer SourceCred Instance](https://balancer-labs.github.io/balancer-cred/#/explorer) was set up in December 2020 and has been collecting contribution data for the past ~4 weeks.

We propose that BAL tokens are distributed to contributors based on the Cred scores recorded by SourceCred and the subsequent grain (or BAL) scores earned among active participants. For more on how this works, please see [this documentation](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/grain/).

The following specification details our proposed structure for these incentives. Inspiration for the allocations and configuration of this instance were modeled after the [MakerDAO SourceCred Trial](https://makerdao.sourcecred.io/#/explorer).

**Forum Incentives**
The Balancer governance forum is the home to the most important discussions and Balancer Improvement Proposals (BIPs).

This program looks to offer a fixed amount of BAL per month to those contributing in meaningful ways, measured using [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) to track aggregate likes, posts and engagement across all topics.

Balancer’s SourceCred instance is heavily weighted towards the amount of likes received across all posts, rather than the quantity of replies. This enforces a **‘quality over quantity’** approach, rewarding contributions that are deemed valuable by the community through engagement and signal.

**Discord Incentives**
We’ve noticed community members on Discord play an active role in educating new users as well as providing valuable feedback and discussion around protocol governance. Through this integration, we want to create mechanisms for those actions to be easily validated and rewarded.

The first instance of Discord incentives will track activity in the [#governance channel](https://discord.com/invite/7hWw6Us), rewarding participants for meaningful contributions in the same way as forum activity - focused on reactions as opposed to post volume to push towards a ‘quality over quantity approach’.

This program looks to serve as an ongoing medium for community members to be better rewarded for their discussion in Discord, with ambitions to boost the importance of BAL emojis and token-based roles using tools like [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/).

**Funding**
The proposed funding for SourceCred incentives is 50 BAL per week to start.

Please note that this program aims to ramp up in the event that it is successful, and we believe that starting with smaller allocations and building up as time goes on is the best way to approach these incentives.

**SourceCred has an opt-in revenue model of allocating 5% of all BAL tokens distributed through this program back to their community, and we are very much in favor of supporting this intiative.**

# Drawbacks
Some points to consider around the introduction of SourceCred incentives for contributions to the Balancer Forum:

* There is potential for this program to be exploited using bots or through collusion between actors.  We will be monitoring the rewards distributed by the instance and will take action if malicious activity occurs.",bullish

If this proposal succeeds, the adjustments will be executed immediately followed by the first overall reduction to CAKE emissions from farms.

I would once again like to reiterate that fact that rewards aren't removed during adjustments, they are just distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

## Summary:

Mellow proposes to add a veBAL gauge for the amphrETH/rstETH/Re7LRT/steakLRT/wstETH 5pool on Balancer.

Root Gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x03ac2920378A51d6CA78813b1d7578Dab08d3760

## Protocol Description:

Mellow LRT is an innovative liquid restaking primitive allowing permissionless creation of modular LRTs. Mellow offers a series of vault smart contracts tailored to different risk profiles, managed by LRT curators. For more information, please see [here](https://docs.mellow.finance/mellow-lrt-primitive/overview).

Mellow has more than 41,000 stETH worth of assets restaked across 4 LRTs curated by P2P (rstETH), Steakhouse (steakLRT), re7 (Re7LRT), and MEV Capital (amphrETH). The protocol quickly reached its cap limits after it launched in mid June 2024. In addition, it recently opened two Ethena related vaults (sUSDe and ENA) and generated an additional 37.5M sUSDe and 23.3M ENA.

## Motivation:

Mellow is seeking to establish the amphrETH/rstETH/Re7LRT/steakLRT/wstETH on Balancer to develop liquidity for its stETH backed LRTs. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Mellow community.

## Specifications:

1. Governance: Mellow currently operates with a multi-sig with [publicly](https://research.lido.fi/t/mellow-lido-alliance-proposal/7557/19) verified signers. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance as soon as required research and preparations are made.

2. Oracles: Mellow is working with RedStone to create price feeds for its LRTs.

3. Audits: Mellow collaborates with renowned security experts and audit firms, including Chainsecurity, Statemind, and Spearbit, and we only release code to production after it has passed external audits.

  1. Statemind Report: https://github.com/mellow-finance/mellow-lrt/blob/dev-symbiotic-deploy/audits/202406_Statemind/Mellow%20LRT%20report%20with%20deployment.pdf
  2. Second audit to be announced
  3. Community audit https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/423

4. Centralization vectors: Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via 24h timelocked proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.

5. Market History: Mellow has seen significant growth in TVL since launching in mid June with over 41k ETH across its 4 LRTs. Mellow

6. Value: The balancer pool is the first DEX liquidity pool for Mellow LRTs and is aimed at providing liquidity to its growing community. Mellow is committed to support LPs with a 2x points boost.

The balancer pools are already live and are available on Ethereum:

### Motivation

Balancer is expanding to Fraxtal per [BIP-608](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-608-deploy-balancer-on-fraxtal/5746) and was wired up initially via [BIP-613](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-613-wire-up-permissions-and-initial-configuration-for-mode-and-fraxtal-chains/5778). The intention of this proposal is to set up the Mainnet and Fraxtal infrastructure to allow for BAL to flow via root gauges to child chain gauges on Fraxtal; making the network fully encompassed in the ecosystem. This will begin the steps of Balancer getting a stronger foothold on the network, permitting vote incentives on pools, and leading to the core pool model being carried out as well.

**Overview:**

As a second part to [[BIP-533] Initiate Cooldown to Withdraw from BAL/AURA/ARB Pool on Arbitrum ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-533-initiate-cooldown-to-withdraw-from-bal-aura-arb-pool-on-arbitrum/5501)this proposal is meant to execute the pool exit and withdraw to remove the BAL, AURA, and ARB from the Arbitrum pool and joint contract, returning the funds to their respective DAO multisigs. The exact amounts will depend upon market conditions at the time of execution, and the timing will lie in the hands of the signers on the relevant multisig.

#### Specification:

The DAO Multisig on Arbitrum `0xaF23DC5983230E9eEAf93280e312e57539D098D0` will interact with the AuraArbBalGrant contract at `0x8D803f7f7e26E586ee90E5A872cf7830e21f7727` and write the `exit` function and for `_minOuts` will pass the return amounts in uint256 format from the queryExit of the poolId `0xbcaa6c053cab3dd73a2e898d89a4f84a180ae1ca000100000000000000000458` for a proportional exit for BAL, AURA, and ARB respectively.

Following the exit, in the same transaction,, the DAO multisig `0xaF23DC5983230E9eEAf93280e312e57539D098D0` will also write the same contract, `0x8D803f7f7e26E586ee90E5A872cf7830e21f7727` function `withdrawBalances` to receive the tokens to the multisig.

758,"currently the % of cake burned of all transactions on pcs is 0.05. this is in my opinion a wasted opportunity to burn more cake. 

with a 100$ transaction this means a 0.05 cent burn.

my proposal is to increase this to either 0.15% or 0.20%. 

this week we bought back 4.7M in Cake from the 9.4 billion dollars that went through pcs.

increasing this to 0.15 will be a 14.1M weekly burn
increasing it to 0.20 will be a 18.8M burn

this ofcourse depends on volume of pcs.

this is also in my eyes a better and quick solution than keep lowering the emissions and cutting down the APY. most people wont notice paying 20 cents instead of 5. but the APY dropping 5% will shake people off.

also when pcs grows to be even bigger and have more total volume we could be deflationary faster than we think. and we wouldnt even have to keep lowering the emissions.",neutral
759,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-gauntlet-and-the-ballers-multisig-to-manage-pool-parameters/2400).

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable Gauntlet and a multisig controlled by Ballers to control certain parameters of the Boosted Pools so as to increase their capital efficiency and returns to liquidity providers.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) contain a series of parameters that affect their efficiency and can be tuned depending on market conditions:

* Boosted Stable Pools ( `StablePhantomPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * amplification parameter
  * token rate cache duration
* Boosted Linear Pools ( `AaveLinearPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * lower target
  * upper target

Gauntlet has been managing fees and amplification factor in weighted and stable pools, and would be able to do so for Boosted Stable Pools if this proposal is approved by the community.

The duration of the token rate cache can have an impact on a boosted pool’s capital efficiency. If the duration is too long, the pool can be arbed for all the interest accrued on Aave since the last update of the cache. A short duration mitigates this risk, with the downside of increasing gas costs for trades.

On Linear Pools, swap fees are not collected by liquidity providers, but rather act as an incentive for arbitragers/keepers to:

1. withdraw main tokens from the pool, deposit them in Aave and deposit the aTokens in the pool when it has main tokens in excess;
2. withdraw aTokens from the pool, withdraw the underlying from Aave and deposit the main token to the pool when it has a low balance of main tokens;

The lower and upper targets determine a range within which no fee in imposed on trades between main tokens and Aave tokens. A trader moving the balance of main tokens away from this range pays a fee to the pool, which the pool then returns to traders that move the balance back towards the range.

While we’re confident that Gauntlet can hit the ground running with respect to optimizing the swap fee and amplification factor of Boosted Stable Pools, there’s still much to be learned when it comes to the other four parameters described above. For this reason, this proposal would authorize a multisig held by Ballers to set those parameters. Balancer Labs would monitor the activiy on the pools and the market conditions and advise on the the best course of action, but Ballers would be the ultimate decision makers, acting on behalf of BAL holders. All updates would be announced in Discord beforehand.

761,"Main purpose of this proposal is to allow users to unlock the CAKE in emergency, reduce the CAKE circulating and reduce the MAX CAKE supply in long term. 

This will give users more confidence as they can unstake CAKE with penalty and they won’t miss out opportunity to cash out if CAKE price increases.

We should allow users to unlock CAKE before unlock date at penalty of 20% and 20% of penalty will be directly sent for burning and the amount is reduced from 750M max supply. This will slowly reduce the max supply and circulating supply and allow users to unlock their CAKE in emergency.

This will bring more users to staking and reduce the CAKE supply in long term.



**Example : 
**
If I have 1000 cake in locked staking, I can unlock CAKE any time and I will get 800 CAKE back and 200 CAKE will be sent to burn address and MAX CAKE supply will be reduced to

##### ABSTRACT
1. $75K for 2.5% equity to the DAO = $3M Valuation
2. 10,000 DAO Dark Lager free for $APE holders
3. +10,000 Cans of Beer for 10 Communities irl events (10 $APE holder independent panel who will decide which events get the beer) + Feld, Quit, Pieter, David & Gene
* We have brewing capacity and the ability to deliver to events in Asia, UK, Canada, and the US
4. $APE Gamified Educational Platform
5. Boring Brewery Clubhouse/Taproom IRL in 2024
6. Otherside and others (such as Faraway) Assets for Yuga Labs Gaming


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
1. We will work with the DAO and legal to give 2.5% equity to the DAO. This first of its kind give back will usher in the next wave of AIP’s and set the stage for true value creation within the DAO amplified by the marketing impact through branding, education and culture driven social content and sharing. By taking this on, Bored Brewing will lay the difficult, but exciting groundwork for giving back to the DAO.
2. We will be spreading knowledge about $APE to less crypto native people who enjoy drinking beer. We believe that $APE can become a currency for the digital revolution and we want to be a small part of spreading the name to a demographic thirsty for this type of knowledge outside of the crypto community.
3. We will sponsor partnered events and share the ApeCoin brand across other relevant crypto/nft communities. The goal is to market the coin and share the background and goals of the DAO for the future.


##### OVERALL COST 
149,696 $APE

- Approx 50K $APE - $75K USD in exchange for 2.5% equity utilizing the SAFE agreement mentioned above.

- 40K $APE for 20,000 (approx $3/can including shipping) Cans of Beer. Designed, recipe developed, partnered with, produced and project managed to deliver Globally.

- 10K $APE towards skins and assets for Metaverse, Gaming, and ODK activations.

- 15K $APE towards software development, design, testing, and deployment of the $APE gamified educational platform for ApeCoin (<50% of the total cost/budget).

## Title: [ARFC] OP Risk Parameters Update for Aave V3 Optimism Pool

## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative

## Date: 2023-08-25

---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the activation of OP as a borrowable asset in the Aave V3 Optimism pool. The aim is to adapt to the maturity of the L2 and attract more suppliers and borrowers, thereby generating new revenue for the protocol.

## Motivation

The Aave OP V3 market is one of the Aave V3 L2 deployments, with OP being the native asset of the OP L2. At its inception, the L2 was in its early stages, leading to the onboarding of OP with conservative parameters due to nascent liquidity & infrastructure. 

As the L2 has matured, the ACI proposes less conservative parameters for the OP asset. By removing the isolation mode for OP and allowing its borrowing, we anticipate attracting more suppliers who can earn a yield on their OP deposits and new borrowers who can use OP to borrow additional assets. This will also generate new revenue for the protocol. 

While the proposed changes are less conservative, they still maintain strict supply, borrow caps, and a conservative interest rate strategy. This ensures that the DAO promotes growth and new opportunities while remaining risk-averse. Based on the collected market data post-implementation, the community will have the opportunity to revisit these parameters at a later stage.

## Specification

- **Asset**: OP
- **OP Contract Address**: [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042)
- **Proposed Interest Rate Strategy Address**: [0x3B57B081dA6Af5e2759A57bD3211932Cb6176997](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3B57B081dA6Af5e2759A57bD3211932Cb6176997)

**New Risk Parameters**:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Asset | OP |
| Supply Cap | 10M |
| Borrow Cap | 500k |
| Loan To Value (LTV) | 30% |
| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 40% |
| Liquidation Penalty (LP) | 10% |
| Liquidation Protocol Fee (LPF) | 10% |
| Stable Borrow | Disabled |
| Base Variable Rate | 0% |
| Slope1 | 7% |
| Slope2 | 300% |
| Optimal Ratio | 45% |
| Reserve Factor (RF) | 20% |

## Next Steps

1. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

772,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) for CRV on Aave V3 Polygon.

## Motivation

As the market liquidity of CRV has seen a substantial decline following the initial Polygon V3 listing, this proposal seeks to address this by decreasing the liquidation threshold (LT) and loan-to-value ratio (LTV). The objective is to mitigate the risk exposure associated with CRV and diminish its borrowing power, thereby aligning it more accurately with the existing market climate. 

As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. We suggest reaching the desired settings with a series of incremental decreases to minimize this impact. This proposal recommends a slightly more aggressive reduction than the one discussed in the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, reducing the LT by 5%.

Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.

At the time of writing this post, zero (0) accounts will be affected by the proposed decrease.

## Specification

| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CRV | LT | 80 | 75 |
| CRV | LTV | 75 | 70 |

## Next Steps

1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.
2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.

**Protocol Description:**

Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.

Inverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;

* On the supply side of money markets by Inverse Finance's “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.
* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA-3POOL through our partnership with Yearn (currently $93M TVL).
* Via purchase with DAI stablecoin using[ The Stabilizer](https://www.inverse.finance/swap/DAI/DOLA).

DOLA is not ""algorithmic"" and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.

**Motivation:**


The Inverse Finance Team aims to be a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions utilizing Redacted Cartel’s Hidden Hand (“HH”) platform to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. 

Current onchain liquidity for INV-DOLA is sitting at just over $800,000 between Sushi and Uni LP. The Sushi pool is incentivized through our own platform with around 950 INV per month (~$75,000 at current prices) in rewards and this has brought $366,000 in depth. This is a poor return, which we believe is due to our platform, Frontier, not having borrows active since June 2022. We believe we can achieve much better ‘ROI’ by migrating INV-DOLA liquidity to Balancer and making full use of the bribe efficiency of the Aura / Balancer platforms, this is as there are way more users checking the platform regularly for yield opportunities. 

Once the 50/50 INV-DOLA pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer.


**Specifications:**

You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    

Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to the DOLA-3CRV[ Curve](https://curve.fi/factory/27) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. This includes[ Frontier](https://www.inverse.finance/frontier) and any lending market officially partnered with Inverse Finance. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

A custom INV oracle with both a price ceiling and borrow cap feature has been in use following a price manipulation[ incident on April 2nd](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/our-plan-making-good). This oracle has been reviewed by Peckshield and is actively managed by Inverse’s Risk team.

Inverse Finance’s new lending market is due to release later this year after audits and will use ChainLink price oracles. Inverse Finance's old lending market relied on both ChainLink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable.

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

Inverse DAO has recently established a working relationship with Peckshield. A first round audit of a recent product was produced ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWNG08mib2GcI1WqnMt5IdFoW73QU2F8/view?usp=sharing)), and an audit of relevant legacy code is in progress. The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. A recent announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:

* Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.
* Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.
* Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 9 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.
* Fed Chair: 2 of 5 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts.

Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).

DOLA stablecoin is fully decentralized, with no possibility to pause or blacklist any addresses, even if INV governance wanted to do so.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

Inverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the “Feds”, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLA’s Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. Please see our graph below of DOLA’s peg YTD.![|689x138](upload://s74SFpZeIWsGgZeDWzoPMZIgTV9.png)
 
6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) 

This pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for INV on decentralized exchanges.",bearish

Title: [ARFC] Harmonize USDT Risk Parameters on Aave V3 Markets 
Author: Aave Chan Initiative
Created: 2023-11-11

---

# Summary

USDT has various risk parameters across the various Aave v3 markets. This proposals aims to harmonize the risk parameters to better align the markets by removing USDT from isolation mode and normalizing risk parameters.

# Motivation

USDT has seen strong borrow demand across networks with borrow utilization over 50% on Aave v3 Ethereum Mainnet and good utilization on secondary networks. However, the various markets currently have different risk parameters, leading to some inefficiency.

This proposal aims to bring the various USDT markets in line with a single set of LTV, liquidation threshold, and liquidation bonus parameters.

# Specification

The proposal sets the LT/LTV of USDT on all deployments at 80/77, matching that of DAI and USDC on v3 Ethereum. Regarding the LB, it will stay the same at 5% on the L2s and 4.5% on Ethereum.

Title: [ARFC] Merit - A New Aave-Alignment User Reward System
Author: Marc Zeller - Aave Chan Initiative
Dated: 2024-02-16
---

## Summary
""Merit"" proposes a merkle-tree-based periodic airdrop system, designed to reward Aave-aligned user behaviors and enhance protocol competitiveness, with a defined budget for the initial 90-day period.

## Motivation
Addressing the competitive DeFi landscape, ""Merit"" seeks to elevate Aave's appeal and efficiency through a rewarding mechanism that prioritizes DAO-beneficial actions, distinguishing Aave from competitors employing artificial incentive methods.

## Specification

The ""Merit"" system employs a booster-based model to reward specific user actions with points, dictating the weekly StkAAVE and GHO distribution. The system incorporates merit boosters and diluters to adjust user rewards based on their alignment with Aave's objectives. The initiative starts with a budget of 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO, totaling 5M$ for a 90-day duration, focusing on direct Aave protocol engagement and promoting diversified staking strategies.

### Rewarded Actions

Actions that align with Aave's strategic objectives will be rewarded:

| Action |
| --- |
| Borrow wETH |
| Borrow GHO |

### Merit boosters

Merit boosters enhance these rewards for specific behaviors:

| Behavior | Multiplier description |
| --- | --- |
| Second-degree user of aligned protocol | booster for users coming from aligned protocols that favor Aave over other protocols. |
| Migrator | Incentive for moving positions to Aave from others protocols |
| Diversity Supporter | Rewards for using minority LSTs |
| Aavenger | usage of AAVE as collateral
| MakerDAO fren | usage of sDAI as collateral
| OG DAO Participant | Booster for early DAO voters or delegates |
| Holdooor | Booster for ≥100-day AAVE holders in the past year |
| Stakoor | Booster for ≥100-day StkAAVE holders in the past year |
| Staker | Bonus for staking AAVE, StkBPT, StkGHO |
| Active in Governance | Rewards for voting or delegating to an Aave DAO recognized delegate platform |

### Merit Diluters

Merit Diluters will dilute part or all rewards for certain behaviors:

| Behavior | Dilution Description/Effect |
| --- | --- |
| User of Non-Aligned Protocol | Severe dilution (up to -100%) |

### Non-aligned protocol list:

We propose to launch Merit with a single protocol with non-aligned status: **Morpho Aave Optimizers V2 & V3**

### Migration bonus multipliers list:

We propose to apply the “migratooor” Boosters to users leaving the following protocols to join the Aave ecosystem:

- Morpho V2
- Morpho V3
- Morpho Blue
- Spark


### Budget and Scope

- **Bi-Weekly Budget:** Defined by Aave Finance service providers, all data will be published publicly after the Merit program ends.
- **Total Budget:** **5M$ with 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO for 90 days.**
- **Scope:** Aave V3 Ethereum.

### Synergies

Numerous protocols reached out during the TEMP CHECK period to co-incentive merit; @karpatkey_TokenLogic via Aave Finance are coordinating these efforts, and their incentives are expected to be on top of the Merit budget.

## Next Steps

1. Refine the proposal details based on community feedback to achieve consensus.
2. Conduct a snapshot vote for community sentiment.
3. Following a successful snapshot outcome, escalate to the AIP stage for official voting and implementation.

781,"## Simple Summary

This Snapshot vote establishes community consensus on whether:
1. New assets are not required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%, or
2. New assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.


## Motivation


Since Gauntlet began its partnership with the Aave protocol, we have received requests from the Community to analyze asset listings. Community members, developers, and other stakeholders often asked us questions like, ""how much liquidity should this asset have before being listed? What should the asset's initial parameters be? How do we protect the protocol from insolvency?"" 

Gauntlet's framework focuses specifically on market risk and how Gauntlet will support the asset listing process in Aave. Our framework can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/gauntlet/Aave-Asset-Listing-Framework-Market-Risk-7c29d448924f444abfa9681410c707c3). This will work in conjunction with [Aave's existing asset listing framework](https://docs.aave.com/governance/guides/new-asset-listing). 

Listing assets is essential to the growth of the protocol. As new assets in DeFi proliferate and older assets fall out of favor, Aave must list and delist assets to maintain its usefulness as a protocol. Gauntlet will conduct these risk assessments prior to new assets being listed, given 2 weeks of notice and strong community buy-in.

Notably, we recommend that LTV and Liquidation Threshold be set to 0% on the initial listing. In other words, assets will not be allowed to be used as collateral upon their initial listing. 

Historically, the community has listed assets with non-zero LTV and Liquidation Threshold. Because there are risks in doing so, this Snapshot vote helps the community align on best practices moving forward.


## Specification

Community input is valuable because requiring that assets are listed with an initial LTV of 0% imposes important trade-offs:

1. Not requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can potentially allow the asset to have more utility (depending on the asset) from the onset of listing. Thus, the protocol may be earning revenue at the onset of the listing (driven by increased borrows). However, when assets are enabled as collateral from the initial listing, the protocol immediately faces the technical and market risks inherent in adding another risk vector to the protocol. The protocol is only as strong as its weakest link.
2. Requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can protect the protocol from unforeseen mechanism, smart contract, and other technical risks. In addition, setting an initial LTV of 0% allows the protocol to observe how supply and borrow usage as well as liquidity conditions evolve following the asset listing. This data enables more robust risk analysis and fine-tuning of LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters following the initial asset listing. The tradeoff is that until an asset is enabled as collateral, usage may be limited (depending on the asset), and thus, the protocol faces an opportunity cost of revenue. We view this as a minuscule opportunity cost (e.g., a few weeks of revenue attributable to the asset) relative to the risks. Assets can be turned on as collateral, but being turned off as collateral is a more difficult process with increased user friction.


Option 1 above should not be interpreted as suggesting that all assets should be enabled as collateral. It simply allows for the possibility that assets can be listed with an initial non-zero LTV should the community deem the asset a collateral asset.

Should the community favor Option 2, assets should be listed with an initial LTV of 0%, and a separate proposal must be proposed by the community at some point after the initial listing to enable the asset as collateral. At that point in time, given strong community buy-in, Gauntlet will conduct market risk analysis to recommend LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters.

## Next Steps


* This Snapshot vote has the below options:
1. Not all assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.
2. All assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%. After 2-3 weeks of operation as a non-collateral asset, the community can propose turning it on as collateral. At that point, Gauntlet will make parameter recommendations as per our Notion document below.

HAL makes it simple to monitor and build automated workflows based on real-time blockchain data. Our mission is to ""glue"" together centralised and decentralised technologies (https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-gluing-manifesto-159cabef0532) to help the ecosystem strive. By leveraging push notifications, DAOs can increase user engagements and provide additional value to their members.

This proposal looks to embed the HAL notification system into the Aave UI.

### Motivation

Given the market volatility, it is critical for Aave's lenders and borrowers to carefully monitor their positions to prevent liquidation. HAL's Aave recipes (https://9000.hal.xyz/aave) are already used by thousands of users for risk management.

Adding HAL into the Aave UI will unlock additional level of protocol engagement and security for all Aave users.

### Benefits for the Aave community

The integration would allow all AAVE users to be notified about the status of their Health Factor. Using our recipe, AAVE users can be notified in real time on the health factor conditions of their position, thus greatly reducing the risk of being liquidated.

Moreover, this integration increases the trust within the AAVE community, allowing anyone to have access to information on the health factor in a straightforward form and with the possibility of receiving a notification via Email, Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Slack and Webhook. We already witnessed a similar positive feedback loop in the past when we did a similar integration with Bancor (https://twitter.com/HAL_Team/status/1389945442818011140).

[ARC] - ERC4626 Strategies as Productive Collateral
Status: Discussion
Author: @llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham
Created: 24-10-2022

---

# Summary

@Llamaxyz is proposing the introduction of a new productive collateral type that allows users to earn the rewards of other protocols by depositing into Aave v3 Reserves.

With the support of the community, Llama will develop ERC4626 strategies that enable Balancer v2 and Curve Liquidity Provider tokens to be deposited as collateral. Users will earn the rewards from the respective Aura Finance and Convex Finance gauges whilst being able to draw a loan against the productive strategies.

This new type of collateral is expected to drive borrowing demand for listed assets and generate additional revenue for Aave DAO by sending 5% of the earned rewards to the DAO.

# Introduction

To support the continued growth of Aave, new types of collateral are needed to unlock emerging segments of the market. Llama proposes onboarding productive assets that are supportive of enhancing capital efficiency through unlocking new utility for user funds.

Currently, there is $4.4B deposited in Convex Finance and Aura Finance, and when Optimism enabled liquidity mining on Aave v3, Total Value Locked (TVL) on Aave increased almost 13x from $36M to $460M. Llama seeks to create the new type of collateral standard and onboard the first BPT and crvLP as collateral on the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

The new collateral type will be listed with SupplyCaps in place, borrowing disabled, and eMode created to shape how users interact with the new pools.

# Motivation

To understand how this strategy works, we will first walk through an example that demonstrates the user experience. In this example, the user deposits a BPT into Aave and claims rewards generated by the Aura Finance Gauge.

![|602x137](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UEG-zIyQMzitglXnGyu4ZMmRnVtXSYsJjhm_LjqBpReHh-tNVzzvBb8vyoD7eJFzvt9lABwS05mrQih-W3cbqGxcqxfgcrA61g2ndRcW712wJd-FdfsrIUf45muVoFnrGqN2-z0FNgUkwF3Dqu7ezygzvabjp2EeS4bVxLFpjnsg4lEJzJnJ061E1A)

The use,r having already invested in a Balancer v2 Liquidity Pool, deposits the BPT into the Aave Reserve and receives back aBPT. The Aave Reserve receives the user’s BPT and deposits it into an Aura gauge. The rewards generated from staking the BPT in the Aura Finance gauge are claimable by the user without needing to redeem the BPT deposit. When the user claims the rewards, 5% are sent to the DAO and 95% to the user.

The productive strategy can also be used as collateral.This creates much more utility for BPTs as users can then borrow against the productive strategy. Apart from levered farming of rewards, users can create buy-now and pay-later strategies that utilize future incentives to pay back the loans. This also creates an opportunity for other communities to build automated strategies that manage rewards and collateralization ratios for users that further streamlines the user experience.

The DAO can decide if pools such as Balancer Boosted Aave Pool (bb-a-USD) and future GHO pools, (bb-a-USD / GHO) can be listed as collateral. Leverage in this application would exhibit similar recursive behavior to that which is occurring on Optimism and could lead to significant volumes of GHO entering circulation over time. If this was to occur, it would have a positive effect on the DAO’s revenue.

It is important to note that, although this proposal mentions Balancer and Aura Finance, the same concept applies to Curve and Convex. The initial deployments are to utilize Aura gauges, with a Convex integration to follow.

# Next Steps

A Snapshot will follow this ARC to determine whether the community would like to move forward with creating this new type of collateral.

If the community votes positively for the development of the upgrade to enable the new type of productive collateral to be onboarded, Llama will set about designing and creating the upgrade. Llama will commit to following best practices and working closely with other stakeholders within the community in developing the new collateral type. In the lead up to deployment on the Aave protocol, further governance approval will be required.

In the future, the community will also be able to decide via Snapshot whether to provide retroactive funding to reimburse the cost associated with the auditing of the new collateral type and how much funding to provide.

A separate Snapshot proposal will emerge where the initial asset listing will be proposed, with contributors such as Gauntlet and others potentially playing a role. Upon agreeing on the initial asset to be listed and whether audit costs are to be reimbursed, an on-chain vote will be submitted for governance approval to transfer funds and introduce the upgrade. This loosely follows the methodology presented in the GHO proposal.
# Conclusion

This ARC is focused on introducing and getting community feedback on introducing Aave’s newest productive collateral to the protocol.

We look forward to hearing community feedback on all aspects of this proposal.",bullish

788,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

789,"Background
AAVE's DAO governance is considering altering AAVE Gold allocation rate, a newly approved function where 1% of bridge volume fees are converted to $gAAVE. $gAAVE has the potential to increase bridge transaction volume and reward holders, but will $AAVE face market cap reduction if a derivative token supply is increased, or will the increase in bridge volume contribute to greater value for users. 

- Proposal
Increase $gAAVE from 1% of bridge volume fees to 2% bridge volume to further incentive bridge usage and reward the AAVE community. Maintain $gAAVE biannual rewards distribution timeline to incentive bridge prioritization and bolster market sentiment. Currently, for every $1M of bridge volume, $10,000 will be allocated to the $sGOLD treasury. This proposal is suggesting to contribute $20,000 to $gAAVE for every $1M of bridge volume, which will later be distributed to bridge users based on wallet activity. A majority vote of 51% or greater is required for the protocol to implement this new addition. 

- What is $gAAVE and when is the first distribution?
AAVE DAO has voted to implement $gAAVE rewards for the first distribution which is live for users from February 19, 2024 to March 15, 2024. Each $AAVE holder is eligibility if their wallet is older than 7 days and they have made a txn with $AAVE. $gAAVE distribution rate will be based on wallet solvency levels and bridge volume. 

If you haven't already, check [HERE](https://aaveprotocol.org) if you are eligibility for the Phase 1 $gAAVE Rewards Distribution. 

- Execution
If this proposal receives a majority vote of 51% of greater, $gAAVE treasury allocation rate will be increase from 1% to 2% to further reward bridge users and hopefully increase overall bridge volume. 

If the new rewards allocation rate is accepted it will be implement in the 2024 Q1 distribution. 

Don't forget to check if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gAAVE distribution if you have been an active $AAVE user or staker

790,"# The Proposal
For a **pilot of four weeks** starting at **00:00 UTC on Monday, January 25**, with possible extension until the launch of Balancer v2, we would allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy.

# Motivation
We understand that gas costs and usability issues in Balancer v1 have been a bit of a hindrance for many users. Balancer v2 is on the way and set to improve this situation immensely, but in the meantime we have recently launched the new and improved exchange UI and would be thrilled to invite users to give it a try without incurring undue personal cost.

# Mechanics 
Similar to the current liquidity mining claims process, where calculations are run once for each weekly period and claims are made available via a MerkleRedeem contract. The script used for computing the reimbursements would live off chain, along with the liquidity mining scripts, and it would be fully open source and auditable by anyone.
 
**Eligible transactions**: transactions made from externally owned accounts _directly to_ the Balancer Exchange Proxy (contract address: 0x3E66B66Fd1d0b02fDa6C811Da9E0547970DB2f21). The goal is to target traders who are using the Balancer Exchange UI. We would use _""EOA interacts with Exchange Proxy directly""_ as a heuristic to determine that the trade comes from a user of the Balancer Exchange UI. This should prevent most on-chain arbitrage bots from benefiting from the program, as most make their trades via proprietary smart contracts.

**Eligible swaps**: swaps between two of the following tokens:
* WETH (0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2)
* WBTC (0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599)
* USDC (0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48)
* DAI (0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F)
* BAL (0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D)

The token list may be expanded following evaluation of the initial pilot.

It is important to distinguish between a _swap_ and a _transaction_ and to note that a transaction through the Balancer Exchange Proxy can contain a number of swaps; a swap is simply one leg of an exchange transaction. For example, a transaction that routes BAL->WETH->DAI contains two eligible swaps: BAL->WETH and WETH->DAI. Similarly, a transaction that routes ineligible token XYZ through XYZ->WETH->DAI contains only one eligible swap: WETH->DAI, and a direct swap of XYZ->WETH is wholly ineligible. Finally, a transaction that routes a BAL->WETH trade through *two* BAL-ETH pools contains *two* swaps.

The gas reimbursement would be the lowest of either:
1. the total gas effectively used by the transaction; or
2. 100,000 (one hundred thousand) times the number of eligible swaps in the transaction

The gas price used for reimbursing each transaction would be the lowest of either:
1. the gas price of the transaction itself; or
2. the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block

It follows that any transaction totaling less than 100,000 gas per eligible swap and utilizing a gas price less than or equal to the block's median would be fully reimbursed, while others partially reimbursed.

Reimbursements would be made in BAL, while gas is priced in terms of ETH, so a conversion is required. The price oracle would be CoinGecko's API, with the median BAL/ETH price from the week being used for all of that week's reimbursements.

Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.

For this pilot, we would set aside 7,500 BAL tokens per week for four weeks. Tokens would be provided by the Balancer Ecosystem Fund. This is a weekly cap for this pilot, so it will not necessarily be fully used. Data from the week of January 4 shows that about 1,500 BAL would have sufficed for reimbursements, so a 5x overhead of 7,500 BAL would be budgeted to account for an influx of transactions and possible swings in the Ethereum gas price. This program would affect neither the ongoing Liquidity Mining campaign nor Batch #2 of the Ecosystem Fund Grants, as both draw from pots that have already been separately allocated. In case more than 7,500 BAL are needed in a given week, reimbursements will be reduced proportionally.",bullish

793,"## Proposal
SEBA submits a proposal to Aave Governance for adding SEBA Bank as a “Whitelister” to Aave Arc.

SEBA is a licensed and supervised Swiss Bank providing a seamless and secure bridge between digital and traditional assets. SEBA serves professional and institutional clients which include top-tier private banks, asset managers and crypto companies. The interest of SEBA’s clients and prospects for crypto earning products has grown substantially overtime. Initially lending crypto and staking with SEBA, those investors are now showing significant interest for accessing yields in DeFi protocols. Due to various regulatory restrictions in their jurisdictions, SEBA’s institutional clientele has not been able deploy liquidities at large scale in Aave until now. The launch of Aave Arc with its permissioned layer represents a great opportunity for them to access DeFi yields while remaining compliant with their regulatory obligations. At SEBA, we believe that this will directly benefit the Aave community with institutional liquidities accelerating growth in TVL and in protocol revenues. 

The Aave Governance will review and approve Whitelisters that will conduct the requisite level of due diligence on Aave Arc participants. As a Swiss digital asset bank, we believe that SEBA is ideally positioned to provide those investors with the flexible and fully regulated platform that they need to bridge new liquidities in Aave Arc.

## About SEBA Bank
Founded in April 2018 and headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, SEBA Bank is a pioneer in the banking industry with the mission to build a regulated and progressive technological bridge between the traditional and the crypto worlds. With a FINMA banking and securities dealer license, SEBA Bank closes an important gap between the new digital economy and traditional banking. SEBA Bank enables professional individuals and companies as well as institutional clients to invest, custody, trade, stake, lend and borrow digital and traditional assets, all in one place. 

What SEBA brings to the Aave Arc community:

*	A fully regulated digital assets bank that embraces innovation
*	With a large institutional client base in demand for exploring new opportunities in DeFi
*	And with a banking-grade platform to securely bridge liquidities in Aave ARC

794,"Harmony is proposing to deploy Aave v2 on the Harmony blockchain to expand lending to a growing community of users and provide incentives to bootstrap the launch of Aave to a new ecosystem. 

Paragraph Summary

Our goal is to accelerate Aave's expansion in the multi-chain world. Harmony is an open and fast blockchain that is fully Ethereum compatible with 2-second transaction finality and near-zero fees. 

Harmony invites the Aave community to support this launch by participating in the Aave contracts deployment, enabling the Aave v2 front-end for Harmony markets, and adding Harmony in its recently announced cross-chain governance module roadmap.  

Harmony will start by providing $5M USD in ONE tokens in incentives to bootstrap initial usage of Aave on Harmony. 

We specifically planned for a one year incentive campaign so that net new users have the opportunity to come into Aave and decentralized finance. We know that many protocols are giving out even higher incentives over a short period of time. We chose an attractive incentive over a longer period so that new users who may not be experienced power users can also benefit from the launch. 

In addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support. 

Our overall goal is to use Harmony’s $300 million ecosystem fund for growing a deep base of 10,000 builders and 10 million users. 

Motivation

Aave is already planning to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Harmony ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Sushi on Harmony and other DeFi projects. Aave will be the first major lending protocol on Harmony and will add net new users from Harmony’s 350,000+ community members. After enabling basic DeFi primitives like AMMs, our community is eagerly awaiting lending markets on Harmony. 

Specifications

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

Harmony is a sharded proof-of-stake blockchain. It has processed more than 120M transactions on mainnet and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible. Our secure bridges offer cross-chain asset transfers with Ethereum, Binance and 3 other chains.

For more details, read our documentation.

Metrics
over 18,010 delegators and 118 validators, staking 4.2 billion ONEs ($700m staked)
$84 million TVL on Sushi on Harmony, and $30 million combined on other DEXes
$91 million TVL on Harmony’s bridge to Ethereum and BSC 
3,200 creators and $1.6 million sales on DaVinci NFT marketplace
100+ active apps; over 135,300 active wallets; over 120 million mainnet transactions

Months 1-3: 40%
Months 4-6: 30%
Months 7-9: 20%
Months 10-12: 10%

Technical Specifications

Harmony will deploy a fork of Aave v2 https://github.com/harmony-one/protocol-v2. We welcome feedback and support of the Aave core devs in deployment. Harmony supports Gnosis multisig, TheGraph subgraphs, Chainlink oracles to enable a fully functional Aave v2 market.  

After the market is functional, we will work with the Aave core devs for cross-chain governance implementation on Aave v2 markets on Harmony.

0x Labs would like to gather signal from the community on whether or not there is support for on-chain governance as proposed in [ZEIP-95](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/95).

## Scope

The forum discussion on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-95-migrating-0x-protocol-to-on-chain-governance-process/3513](https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-95-migrating-0x-protocol-to-on-chain-governance-process/3513)

As described in the forum discussion, there would be a three-step process to the full transition to a new governance mechanism:

1. Deployment of the new governance smart contracts for initial calibration and testing
2. Migration period: ZRX holders can start registering to the new system
3. Vote to switch governance systems: 0x is fully controlled by new smart contracts

This snapshot vote will only give signal on the community’s sentiment with step 1. 

If sentiment is favorable, 0x Labs will continue to develop and deploy the system of smart contracts that define a new governance mechanism — the technical implementation can be found open sourced [here](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/95).

A subsequent vote (ZEIP-95) will be required to officially switch ownership of the `exchangeProxy` contract to a new governance mechanism, completing the transition.

797,"Dear all,

Just in the past months i started my journey in pancakeswap farms and pools. It is truly interesting and quite satisfactory to me. Everything run smoothly. However, though the current appearance of pancakeswap is already outstanding, i would like to propose an additional feature to the pools for the convenience of investors and better experience with pancakeswap. Following is my proposal,

In the pools, i would like to propose to show 2 kinds of APY:

1. First is the APY with regards to the amount of CAKE staked (since i cannot find a good explanation of the exact calculation in the docs, i assume that this is the current method of calculating APY that is shown in the app).

2. Second is the APY with regards to the amount of the initial calculated USD staked (this helps the stakers to see how much their money, in USD, really grow). For example, if i staked $100 in cake and APY of 10% in cake, and the price of cake down by 5% the next day, i can still get an APY of about 4.5% according to my initial USD.

I hope that the community support this idea.

A proposal to make parameter changes on Ethereum v3 and v2, Optimism v3, Arbitrum v3, Polygon v3. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-interest-rate-recommendations-for-weth-and-wmatic-on-v2-and-v3/14588/7).

## Motivation
Gauntlet’s analysis has identified opportunities to adjust interest rate parameters for WETH on Ethereum v3, Optimism v3, Arbitrum v3, Polygon v3. This will help to facilitate more Emode borrowing against LST collateral, which may
- drive additional revenue to Aave. 
- adjust current risk profile for LST to depend less on onchain liquidity, which has been steadily declining over the past few months. This may be adding risk to the current borrow composition against LST collateral.

### Goal of the vote
This poll is to utilize Snapshot's ""Voter Privacy"" setting for use in future off-chain snapshot votes. (Disclaimer: voter privacy is turned on for this Snapshot temporarily as a POC and will be reverted if this vote does not pass)

### Context
Snapshot proposals are currently used to gauge community sentiment on serious topics under consideration for onchain governance votes that impact 0x protocol.

Currently, snapshot votes use the default voting privacy setting which shows the result of an ongoing poll in real time. As of October 2022, Snapshot integrated with ShutterDAO to enable an opt-in voting privacy setting which will encrypt votes while the poll is live and only review the result when the voting period is over.

### Why Opt-in to Voting Privacy?
While 1 token 1 vote has made participating in governance easier, there are some major shortcomings to it as talked about by prominent people within the blockchain space Vitalik (1, 2, 3). Highlighting two of the problems here are (1) plutarchy, or the ability for wealth/capital to heavily influence vote results, (2) bribery & collusion, or the ability for highly coordinated individuals/groups to heavily influence vote results. As a consequence of suboptimal governance, we also see (3) voter apathy or low participation.

While Opting into voting privacy does not solve all of these problems completely, I think that it would be a meaningful experiment and be a step in the right direction. In terms of how hiding the current result of a vote while it is still live could address each of those three problems above specifically

1. Plutarchy - increases the cost for an attacker to influence the result since it’s not clear how many votes they’d need to get their preferred outcome.
2. Bribery & Collusion - reduce strategic voting for non-basic voting systems (i.e. rank-based where people might not vote truthfully if it increases the change of their preferred option winning)
3. Voter Apathy - reduce the feeling that a vote doesn’t matter since it’s unclear what the current tally is

\
This proposal aims to cover important smart contract upgrades that will allow for the rescue of user funds, improved pausing functionality and additional safeguards via blacklisting.

This proposal will not cover the **execution** of the proposed rescue function and unpausing. Those items will be addressed later via a future BIP.

Specifics:
-
\
**Upgrade all affected Setts with the following new functionality:**

* add **rescue function** to transfer sett tokens from attacker wallets to recovered.badgerdao.eth (one time use - patchBalance() function)
* add a ‘**global pause**’ feature that allows all Sett contracts to be paused and unpaused simultaneously with the same permissions as current pausing functionality
* add global **blacklist** to block actions, set to the attackers wallets listed below

**Blacklisted Attacker wallets:**

* 0x1FCdb04d0C5364FBd92C73cA8AF9BAA72c269107
* 0xa33B95ea28542Ada32117B60E4F5B4cB7D1Fc19B

* 0xe06eD65924dB2e7b4c83E07079A424C8a36701E5

**NOTE**: Approval to execute the following actions will be submitted via a future BIP that will undergo the Badger Governance Process:

* Execute the new patchBalances() function to rescue funds from the attacker to the recovery multisig
* Unpausing the Sett contract to resume normal operation

Why is this BIP being expedited?
-
\
Badger is committed to reopening smart contracts as soon as it is safe to do so. Given the timelock considerations, waiting for the standard timeframe before making these upgrades would add a minimum 3 day lag once the final BIP to execute the proposed actions to rescue funds and unpause is decided.

As such, this proposal uncouples the smart contract upgrades from the execution of the rescue action and unpausing so that the execution decision can follow Badger’s governance process, while also ensuring the resulting governance decision can be enacted promptly.

Amended requirements to pass expedited governance proposal:
-
\
Given this BIP will go directly to snapshot, it will require a supermajority of over 70% at a quorum of more than 200,000 votes in order to pass.

Additionally, among the older contracts, 1 Sett and 8 Strategy contracts have the Timelock set as their governance address. In order to align them with the rest of the infrastructure, Badger will change their governance to the [devMultisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB65cef03b9B89f99517643226d76e286ee999e77).

This will give Badger the ability to handle unpausing and transferring tokens away from attacker wallets atomically and with agility, which is the preferred technical approach to the situation. Badger intends to propose using the timelock for all key parameter changes as part of the future governance 2.0 initiatives.

Note that the timelock is still needed for upgrades or adding new strategies which are the critical operations that involve handling of user funds.

This transaction will require going through the Timelock process. Once executed, the unpausing of the whole infrastructure will be handled by the devMultisig directly and no timelock will be required for it.

**Summary:**
> This pool uses the new weighted pool factory which allows us to apply the protocol fee to yield bearing tokens. This gauge would enter as a ""core pool"" under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. In addition, any LDO collected by the `ProtocolFeeCollector` would also be used to bribe for votes on this pool. There is a small LDO pool which contributes regular protocol fees so this will allow Balancer to boostrap initial liquidity and kickstart the flywheel here.

**Protocol Description:**

> wstETH is liquid staked ETH. LDO is the governance token. 

**Motivation:**

> Balancer already has significant wstETH liquidity and this pool is regularly our #1 contributor to protocol fees. The goal with this pool is to stimulate additional trading activity with wstETH, thus making our pile of wstETH liquidity even more valuable to the protocol. Given LDO holders are likely already holding wstETH, this is a natural first pairing to pursue. LDO liquidity has also proven to be a good revenue generator for us as well - it is logical that encouraging more of it should be a good thing. 

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Find more information about governance on Lido's [forum](https://research.lido.fi/).   

2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on a rate provider for wstETH which Balancer has been using already for awhile. See [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768).

3. **Audits:** See [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits).

4. **Centralization vectors:** See [here](https://lido.fi/faq) for information on this.

5. **Market History:** See [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao). 
 
6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on wstETH yield. Our existing small LDO pool already generates significant protocol revenue, thus it stands to reason we should earn more revenue if we can attract more LDO liquidity. By paring with wstETH we also encourage more wstETH trading activity and since wstETH/ETH is one of our largest pools, any increase in trading activity will make wstETH liquidity even more profitable for us.

## Problem

Uniswap's governance treasury will retain 43% of $UNI supply vested over 4 years, currently allocated 113 million in $UNI. Current value ~ ****$2.724 Billion USD. Max drawdown starting on May 3 2021, in 20 days $UNI lost 71% of it's value, a loss of ~ **$3.616 Billion USD.**
We need to manage this systemic risk and volatility for the long term success of the community treasury. 

## Solution

Partial divestment of Uniswap governance treasury by using UMA Synthetic KPI Options to create a win for the treasury, a win for the protocol and a win for the stakeholders. Long term goal would be to put together an actively managed portfolio for the treasury aka uniHOUSE.

# Background

## Yam.Finance

[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has been leading the charge on treasury management for DAOs via our project DAO House: [https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a](https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a)

We've realized that there are significant systemic risks for DAO's treasuries. During the bear market of 2017 multiple projects were forced to sell their treasury at historically low values, which ultimately caused many of them to disband and shutter. 

Treasury management is mission critical for DAOs, yet the challenges and complexities are formidable. Sushi realized this systemic issue and collaborated with [Yam.Finance](http://yam.Finance) to build a custom treasury management solution called sushiHOUSE: [https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106)

The most difficult part of a treasury management solution for a DAO as large as UNI, is the first part, the treasury protocol token divestment. I present a novel solution that will benefit the treasury, the long term success of the protocol and also all stakeholders. 

## UMA Synthetics

A quick primer on UMA: [https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works)

By using UMA's platform, we are able to use battle tested UMA financial contracts to create KPI options. Here are some examples of current KPI options that are already deployed and distributed.

[https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4)

[https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa](https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa)

# KPI Options

## How do KPI Options work?

KPI options can be created by using UMA's battle tested UMA financial contracts. 

1. Determine KPI metric for the synthetic. For example, KPI metric is Total Value Locked (TVL), currently ~$1.5b. KPI Metric could be many different things like volume, total fees generated over 30 days ect. 
2. Determine target for KPI, value and expiry date. For example, we want to target 2x TVL start, $3b and want the option to expire end of 2021.
3. Mint KPI option by depositing collateral to be used at settlement. For example, collateralize 1 $UNI token for 1 KPI option. 
4. For our example above:
    1. TVL option starts at a value of .5 $UNI because current TVL is $1.5b
    2. If TVL > $3b before the end of 2021, the TVL option can be settled for 1 $UNI after it expires at the end of 2021. 
    3. If TVL < $3b at expiry it will be worth a fraction of 1 $UNI. For example at expiry TVL is $2b, the value of the synth expires to 2/3 $UNI = .667 $UNI.
    4. Synth is unliquidatable and fully collateralized. 

## How do KPI Options divest UNI's community treasury?

From example above, KPI Option is created by:

1. Collateralizing 1 $UNI token 
2. KPI metric tracked is TVL, starting at $1.5b
3. Target is $3b TVL by the end of the year. If it reaches $3b TVL anytime before expiry  

UNI's community treasury is able to utilize its treasury full of UNI tokens to create these KPI options. 

1. KPI Options would be minted by treasury and sold for stable coins via a gnosis auction or by various other means. Implied value of the option is .5 UNI (current TVL is $1.5b with target of $3b). 
2. The sale would fund the treasury with stablecoins which could then be used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options by using Uniswap's AMM pools. 
3. At expiry all KPI options could be settled and stablecoins withdrawn from LP positions. 
4. Treasury now has stable coins = WIN!
5. UNI stake holders have incentives to increase TVL = WIN!
6. Stablecoins are the cornerstone of long term success for UNI protocol = WIN!

Win - Win - Win

# Additional Details

[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has extensive knowledge on building synthetics on UMA's platform via our development of [degenerative.finance](http://degenerative.finance), V2 of site to be launched soon. Combined with our experience in DAO treasury management, it allows us to have a unique perspective to create this proposal.

title: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
created: 2024-02-29

---

# Summary

This publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee with 500k GHO to continue supporting GHO's liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next 3 months.

# Motivation

Since its initial [funding in October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/343/), the Aave Liquidity Committee (previously GLC) has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes by deploying and incentivising liquidity pools.
 
As a result of these efforts:

* Deeper on-chain liquidity
* Lower slippage, especially for GHO to USDC swaps

In combination with other efforts like stkGHO, ALC's initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHO's peg recovery.

Throughout the period, the ALC leveraged on both Uniswap v3 and, more frequently, Maverick to tailor liquidity distribution at specific price ranges which helped absorb GHO downward market volatility. A list of active Boosted Positions can be found [here](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions?chain=1).

While some pools are incentivised by voting with pre-existing DAO holdings (e.g. vlAURA), others like Maverick's concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses. It is worth noting, the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick. We expect Maverick, and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3, to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience.

Concentrated GHO liquidity was [recently introduced in Balancer](https://twitter.com/GyroStable/status/1757365157917815001) with the creation of several E-CLP pools. These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAO's vlAURA holding. When there is excess vlAURA votes, these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70% APR nominated in USDC. 

The following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHO's ecosystem, highlights:

* GHO/USDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume 
    * 0.2% bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period
    * 0.1% bin width pool is starting to replace the 0.2% bin width pool trading volume. This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 0.1% bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility 
*  GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP
    *  Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by [other protocols](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Graham_/status/1762076544241955070) and leveraged farming is introduced
* Gyrsocope E-CLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks
    *  As the peg improves, one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg

The next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas:

* 1.00:1.00 peg with USD 
* Reducing price volatility
* Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations
* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools
* Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases

These efforts will need to scale to match GHO's expected growth profile. The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins, and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future, as well as participation in the launch of various projects like [Ethena](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and [f(x) Protocol's launch](https://x.com/protocol_fx/status/1762822716854354015?s=20). 

Though there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates, price volatility, and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations, we believe a high-level budget will look like the following:

| Objective | Category | Budget   |
| --------  | --------  | -------- |
| Liquidity | Peg Resilience | 360k GHO |
| DeFi Integrations  | Create Utility  |  140k GHO |
|Total| | 500k GHO|

It is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum.

# Performance Indicators

The below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking:

| Description| Optimal Value|
| --------  | --------  |
| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M |
| TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools  | 15M excl. stkGHO  |
| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |
| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap | < 0.10%  (GHO to USDC)|
| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  |
| Price level for > 90% time   | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  |

Please note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next 3 months on the assumption the Borrow Cap is continually increased beyond the current 35M Bucket Size. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.

The [stkGHO implementation](https://app.aave.com/staking), [USDe integration](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and coordinated efforts to attract users to acquire GHO are all great examples of how growth initiatives drive GHO utility, adoption and have a positive impact the spot price. 

Each of the above metrics, plus more, will be shown on the TokenLogic analytics dashboard.

# Specification

Swap the following assets for GHO:

* 250k aUSDT
* 250k aUSDC

Create an allowance for 500k GHO.

817,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

As we continue to migrate PancakeSwap’s v2 pools to their more efficient v3 counterparts, we are able to gradually lower the overall CAKE emission, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate a smooth trading experience. Ultimately, the migration opens the opportunity to contribute a greater amount of CAKE towards the weekly burn.

The sections below detail the requested changes to continue transitioning v2 pools to v3 and outline the expected increase in CAKE burn.

The previous round of [**Adjustments to v2 Farm Rewards**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0xa9e22aaf3ed47bed0897c2e268e43582cd5471476999644d7b43352acf75070f) increased the CAKE burn by ~500 CAKE per day. This round continues on that trend and increases the CAKE burn by ~500 CAKE per day. This is enabled by decreasing farm emissions on select BSC v2 pools, while launching their more efficient BSC v3 counterparts that are listed below.

These optimizations will add up over the coming months to 1) improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across liquidity pools and 2) redirect CAKE rewards towards the highest growth farms, ultimately accelerating the path towards ultrasound CAKE.

#### Adjustment Details

With the above in mind, we are proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below. Across this proposal, rewards will be redistributed from farms with reduced multipliers (primarily on v2) to farms with increased multipliers (primarily on v3). Note: BNB Chain v2 and v3 farms not listed below will continue to earn the same level of rewards. 

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their average daily volume, 14-day volume, capital efficiency, etc.

818,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.


## Specification

This past week did not see outsized changes in market conditions nor within the Aave protocol. There were slight volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets. Our platform recommends the following set of parameter changes that will decrease liquidation bonuses on several less-utilized assets.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAL Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |
| DPI Loan To Value     | 65%     | 70%     |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| DPI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |
| ENJ Loan To Value    | 60%     | 70%     |
| MANA Loan To Value    | 65%     | 70%     |
| MKR Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| UNI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |

More recently, the DAO has chosen to [incorporate a foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x357877d9d3d121e929f66cad2349987fc658be449585f8d021319b69a3a0e620) in order to engage with service providers who require formal contracts.

This framework aims to deliver the following benefits:

* Streamlined process for funding service providers
* Clear and decentralized accountability mechanisms
* Creation of a delegate system to enable a transparent dialogue between proposers and large token holders

## II. Process for Funding Service Providers

A service provider (“SP”) is an entity with a budget attached to it, managed by one or more Leaders, that coordinate and pay contributors working to achieve one or more long term goals in the Balancer Ecosystem. When choosing to pursue funding as a SP or through the Grants program, a rough guideline is short term or one off engagements requiring $100k or less should go through Grants. A longer term engagement or one with a cost beyond $100k should be pursued as a SP.

To keep things simple, the terms “service provider”, “working group”, and “subDAO” are considered synonyms and interchangeable. A SP can be an incorporated legal entity or simply a loosely organized group of anonymous Balancer contributors. In order to interface with the Foundation a legal agreement is required so any SP taking advantage of the Foundation must be a legal entity or a natural person.

SP's have an option to make their funding proposal through the Foundation. If it is made through the Foundation, the Foundation will create the funding proposal on the forum on behalf of the SP. The SP is expected to answer any community questions or concerns raised on the forum. Funding will be distributed to the Foundation’s wallet on a quarterly basis and from there distributed to the SP on a defined monthly basis. If the SP does not go through the Foundation then funding will be distributed directly to the SP on a quarterly basis.

*All funding proposals must include “Domains of Operation” and “Key Objectives”.*

### II.1 Domains of Operation

Examples of Domains might be core protocol development, partner integrations, marketing, business development, front end, community, etc. While some overlap is acceptable (multiple SP’s operating in the same Domains) it is generally not an effective use of DAO funds to have multiple marketing teams or multiple teams managing the community for example. Clearly indicating Domains of Operation and the expertise an SP brings to that Domain will reduce inefficient overlap and help to increase coordination in the event of necessary or useful overlap. Having multiple SP’s building front ends might represent a useful overlap, for example.

Each SP should make clear how they will handle record keeping and the handover of those records in the event they are offboarded. If an SP proposes to enter a domain of operation already occupied by another approved SP, the proposal should outline how they plan to coordinate efforts to avoid the DAO paying double for the same work. It is expected that the work product of each SP is made available to the community on a regular basis.

### II.2 Key Objectives

Key Objectives should be high level goals the SP plans to work towards and accomplish during the funding period. If appropriate, these might be broken down into a list of specific tasks. It is important that the DAO have a clear idea of what the SP is doing while also leaving enough flexibility for innovation and efficiency. Providing success metrics will also ensure the community can easily evaluate performance.

Finally, a brief overview of how the funds would be spent is the last requirement. In the event of an SP requiring additional funds before the end of the funding period a supplemental budget request can be made in the same format as a regular funding request. An estimate of the SP’s monthly spend should be included which will be used to calculate the quarterly distribution of funds.

*All SP’s going through the Foundation must upload a copy of their “Service Level Agreement” or SLA to ipfs and include the link in their funding proposal.*

## III. Accountability Mechanisms

We must ensure any funds disbursed from the DAO treasury are used transparently and in service of the Balancer Ecosystem. Ultimately veBAL holders are responsible for ensuring SP’s are delivering enough value to justify the cost of funding them. We propose the following rules for holding SP’s accountable:

* All SP’s must hold monthly community calls in any online venue of their choosing as long as it is open to the public. Failure to hold a monthly call will prevent the Foundation or the DAO from disbursing future funds. The recordings of these community calls must stay available for at least 3 months after the community call has wrapped up.
* In combination with the monthly community call, a monthly summary must also be created which details progress towards each “Key Objective” outlined by the SP in their funding proposal. This should be posted to Balancer’s forum in advance of the monthly community call.
* Anyone can make a forum proposal to the DAO to stop the Foundation/DAO from disbursing future funds to the SP. Such a proposal should include: SP in question, reason to halt funding, supporting evidence, and any other comments.
* If the vote passes, all future funding to that SP will be halted until a new funding proposal is successfully approved. If it fails, funding continues as normal.
* There will be an internal monthly meeting with mandatory attendance by at least one representative of every actively funded SP. The goal of this meeting is to ensure all SP’s are strategically aligned across the ecosystem. Ideally each SP should keep their representative the same month to month.

Every member of Balancer’s community shares responsibility for ensuring SP’s that receive funding from the treasury are acting in the best interest of the Balancer ecosystem. The rules outlined above empower every community member to act if they feel an SP is no longer acting in that best interest. The Foundation is an agent of the DAO and must honor the outcome of any legitimate snapshot vote, subject to any applicable Laws/Acts and Regulations.

## IV. Contribution Funding Pathways
 
![486b132175a0785b857c6da537b78f149eafd618_2_624x339.png](ipfs://QmQWtsoMzcvCBcu4WxMQLo2Bb9V48k2gn72pnkNgUik1ee)
    
## V. Delegate System

While anyone can initiate a proposal to stop funding a SP it is large veBAL holders who have the strongest incentive to ensure SP’s are delivering value. The creation of a delegate system will lead to a more transparent and productive dialogue between proposers and those with large voting power. We encourage anyone interested in being a delegate to present their platform to the community in the new “[Delegate Citadel](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)” section of the forum.

## VI. Voting

Delegates and token holders should not vote in favor to fund or against to defund a SP that they are working for or affiliated with. Additionally, SP’s should not compensate token holders monetarily in exchange for their votes (do not bribe on funding or defunding proposals).

There will be a third voting option added to snapshot to cover the case of a SP being affiliated with many large veBAL holders and thus failing to pass a proposal to fund them because so much voting power cannot vote in good faith. For each SP funding proposal, there will be “Yes”, “No”, and “Abstain”. It is expected that delegates and any token holders with a potential conflict of interest regarding a particular SP will only vote for “Abstain” if they choose to vote at all and provide the reason for doing so.

## VII. Risk Assessment

There are various risks to the ecosystem that could arise from the adoption of this proposal.

* A veBAL token holder might work for a SP (or the SP might have holdings of veBAL itself) and vote in favor of funding the SP despite this conflict of interest.
* A SP might get funded and not follow through on their key objectives. With funds sent on a quarterly basis, this could result in a sizable loss of funds.
* Balancer sees multiple SP funding requests and if all were funded this would represent an unsustainable burn rate.

The way to mitigate these risks is to foster an active and engaged community. Conflicts of interest should be declared up front to prevent any appearance of impropriety. Unknown or new SP’s might want to request a lower funding amount and/or utilize milestone based payments as a trial period. If milestone based payments are utilized they should be overseen by the Grants Service Provider. Delegates and those community members who handle management of treasury funds should speak up about the impact funding SP’s will have on the treasury - and it is a good idea for each SP to include their assessment of that impact in their proposal if they can.

The responsibility for stewarding the Balancer ecosystem towards a bright future lies with veBAL holders and delegates. We could try to create many rules to address many possible scenarios but we see value in creating a simple and flexible framework for funding all kinds of Balancer contributors.

## VIII. Specification

If this proposal passes, the following will be in effect:

* Any future funding proposals must adhere to the guidelines as described above. **Please find an [example template here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/how-to-create-a-funding-proposal/3233)**.
* The Ops subDAO will dissolve at the end of the second quarter. After salaries are paid for June, any remaining funds will be returned to the DAO Multisig. All powers held by Ops will return to veBAL governance.
* This proposal will mark the start of a new tracking system, BIP or Balancer Improvement Proposal. When a proposal is added to snapshot it will be given a BIP number - consider this proposal to be BIP-1.",bearish
820,"**Introduction:**

Stake DAO is a non-custodial platform built on top of decentralized protocols that enables anyone to easily grow their crypto portfolio.

Among the various services that Stake DAO offers, Stake DAO allowed users to stake their CRV tokens, which were locked in to veCRV on Curve, in exchange for sdveCRVs.

**Motivation**:

Stake DAO users used this service and the sdveCRVs received in return for the users' CRV lock were subsequently placed in the Balancer Pool to provide liquidity on sdveCRV/CRV. As a result,

StakeDAO had 83,053.205742818150358418 3CRV stuck in sdveCRV contract and only the Balancer vault address was eligible to claim them

However, because of the specificities of the Balancer Pool and sdveCRV contract, claiming these 3CRV was impossible for Stake DAO. Therefore, to recover and redistribute the 3CRV rewards to the users who had initially entrusted CRV to Stake DAO, it was agreed with the Balancer and Stake DAO to move these 3CRV stucked to the Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector (0xce88686553686da562ce7cea497ce749da109f9f) and then send them back to the Stake DAO multisig address, via this proposal, to allow Stake DAO to redistribute them to the eligible users.

**Risks**: There is no specific risk associated with this proposal

**Specification**:

Balancer & Stake DAO have agreed that the exchange will take place as follows

Already done : Stake DAO sent 83,053.205742818150358418 3CRV from 0x478bbc744811ee8310b461514bdc29d03739084d to Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector : 0xce88686553686da562ce7cea497ce749da109f9f via [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6a188cdf368d6e8bfd0b290397194f704646b97105282c9556c1f499d9ce7d7b

Creating a home for the ApeCoin community within the tokenproof mobile app will help increase community participation, enable member onboarding, highlight community projects, and further incentivize ownership of ApeCoin by securing dedicated mobile real estate to distribute news, content, and experiences offered to community members.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

The integration of a dedicated ApeCoin Community Hub within the tokenproof app promises a number of benefits to the ApeCoin Ecosystem:

- **Enhanced Community Engagement**: By aggregating information, news, and opportunities, the hub will act as a catalyst for more active participation among ApeCoin holders. This can lead to higher voting rates for proposals and a more vibrant, engaged community.
- **Increased Awareness and Onboarding**: The hub will serve as a centralized platform for ApeCoin holders to learn about the various benefits, projects, and initiatives. This can lead to greater involvement from holders who may have been previously unaware or passive.
- **Boost in ApeCoin Projects**: A dedicated section for ApeCoin projects will provide them with the visibility they need, enabling them to gain traction and support from the community. This not only helps these projects flourish but also strengthens the overall ApeCoin ecosystem.
- **Consolidated Communication Channel**: The hub will act as a one-stop-shop for all things ApeCoin, reducing the need for holders to juggle between various platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Snapshot. This streamlining can lead to better information dissemination and more coherent community discussions.
- **Incentivized Ecosystem Growth**: The hub can also act as a platform for collaborations, partnerships, and joint ventures between different ApeCoin projects. This fosters an environment of mutual growth and collaboration within the ApeCoin ecosystem.

#### OVERALL COST

If the AIP is approved and funding secured, $80,000 USD (in its $APE equivalent) would be reserved and awarded incrementally upon delivery of the aforementioned capabilities, and according to funding schedule above. The funds obtained in this AIP will provide the ability to finance the development of the initial scope, support, bug fixes, minor updates, and maintenance costs for the duration of the AIP.

**Summary**

Whitelist for veBAL voting:

[OHM-ETH-DAI pool gauge ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xc45d42f801105e861e86658648e3678ad7aa70f900010000000000000000011e)

**References**

[Website] [https://www.olympusdao.finance/ ](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)

**Protocol Description**

Olympus DAO is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the OHM token. Each OHM token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. UST, DAI, FRAX, wETH) in the Olympus treasury, giving it an intrinsic value. Olympus also introduces novel economic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding.

**Motivation**

Recently Olympus DAO seeded a tri-pool with OHM-DAI-wETH with the intention of utilizing the pool for the Olympus Incubator program. The original intention was that protocols can use Copper or PrimeDAO to raise in OHM, bringing volume through Balancer. However, Olympus is now interested in growing the pool further to facilitate a deeper meta pool for prospective partners and to deepen its relationship with Balancer. To this end, Olympus is proposing a BAL gauge for the pool, which will draw additional third party capital and allow Olympus to begin participating in governing the burgeoning Balancer ecosystem.

**Specification**

**Governance:** OlympusDAO is governed by OHM and gOHM token holders through snapshot votes and forum proposals.

**Oracles:** No use of oracles within the OlympusDAO protocol.

**Audits:** Same link as above within docs.

**Centralization vectors:** Specific treasury functions are controlled through a multisig, however Olympus has made it a focal point of its mission to work toward full decentralization including the treasury and full on-chain governance. Olympus is currently in discussions with Balancer to be a key component of the shift to on-chain governance.

**Market History:** OHM launched and was made transferable on March 23rd with incentives for users to provide liquidity in exchange for the OHM token. OlympusDAO using the veBAL voting system to boost BAL rewards for its OHM pools along with Olympus ecosystem partners.

**Summary:**

> This pool uses the ComposableStablePoolFactory-v3 1 which addresses the [reentrancy vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345) disclosed during February 2023. This gauge is uncapped, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329). This means 65% of 50% of yield generated by this pool is to be used for bribing for votes on it via [Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/balancer). 
> 
>The pool stMATIC/bb-a-wMATIC is to replace the primary stMATIC/wMATIC pool on Balancer v2. The current stMATIC/wMATIC contains $57.9M in TVL at the time of writing and is the largest pool on the Polygon deployment.

**Protocol Description:**

> This pool utilises stMATIC and linear pool bb-a-wMATIC which deposits wMATIC into Aave v3 wMATIC reserve on the Aave v3 deployment on Polygon. The linear pool utilises a wrapper developed by Aave Companies.

**Motivation:**

> Migrating from stMATIC/wMATIC to stMATIC/bb-a-wMATIC is expected to generate an additional 31.6 bps (158/2 x 0.5 x 0.8) of yield for Liquidity Providers (LPs) after fees and bribes relative to the current pool. This is due to the Aave v3 wMATIC reserve generation 158 bps of deposit yield. Historically, this yield has been higher.
> 
> Excluding token emissions, the inclusion of the bb-a-wMATIC linear pool, increases the passive yield for LPs by an estimated 10.2%, (0.316%/3.11%). This is equivalent to >15x the swap fee APR at the time of writing as most of the yield is derived from stMATIC within the pool.

**Title:** [ARFC] Set Liquidity Observation Labs as Emission manager for wstETH on Scroll
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-03-02

---

## **Summary**

This ARFC proposes to set Liquidity Observation Labs wallet as the emission manager for the wstETH token on Scroll. This will enable Liquidity Observation Labs to define and fund incentive programs for all wstETH markets, including Scroll, promoting growth and expanding the user base of Aave.

## Motivation

Governance have already approved setting Liquidity Observation Labs as Emission manager for wstETH on the current Aave V3 Markets. 

But since Scroll market is live, the current ARFC is set to establish Liquidity Observation Labs as Emission manager for wstETH, aligning with the desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3. 

By setting their wallet as the emission manager for the wstETH token, the Foundation will be able to directly fund incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets.

## Specification

The Liquidity Observation Labs wallet address is:

Emission Admin Wallet (Liquidity Observation Labs): [0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022)

The AIP call setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract.

`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(wstETH,[0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022],EMISSION_ADMIN);`

This method will set the Liquidity Observation Labs wallet as the emission admin for the wstETH token on Scroll, besides the current Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and Gnosis V3 markets.

## Disclaimer

This proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative has not been paid by Liquidity Observation Labs or any third party for this proposal.

## Next Steps

1. Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.
2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage

836,"# Problem
It has been brought to the notice of the Swerve Community that a lot of users who are actively involved both in Curve, and Swerve communities are being banned from Curve Discord without a justification. Some of them are being banned even for simple participation in dialogue on Swerve Discord server.

This is an unjustifiable mode of censorship that should not be a part of any community within crypto ecosystem. The blockchain ecosystem is built on the core values of openness, transparency and censor-ship resistant participation, both in what goes on on-chain as well as off-chain.

I believe this action of Curve moderators executing unilateral bans on active participants of Swerve community are a significant step back from the core values of the ecosystem.
# Solution
Curve team/moderators/community should embrace transparency and criticism. They should stop limiting access to information, putting up barriers to community participation, and shun censorship as a mode of community management.

While it would be great if the core team of Curve strives to also bring transparency to their operations, this proposal does not apply to it.

# Proposal
As an immediate response to the passing of this proposal this proposal seeks to request the Curve moderators to reverse the bans on members who have been banned for Curve discord simply be committing the crime of participating in discourse on Swerve Discord.

Recently Fernando suggested we increase the “Ballery” from 100 BAL/month to 500 BAL/month with 60% long term vested (1y cliff, 1y linear vest period via Sablier) and 40% liquid. This was met with broad support on an informal basis. Ballers have the option to take a full or half Ballery and you can see the current breakdown of who’s taking what here: [https://www.notion.so/63091677228841de9fa909139e60362f?v=a7852fc9da684a5a834934e5215edd6d](https://www.notion.so/63091677228841de9fa909139e60362f?v=a7852fc9da684a5a834934e5215edd6d)

This is the most members the Ballers have ever had, and commensurately I expect the program to execute and deliver positive results in the community more effectively than we ever have. It is important to have oversight and to be accountable for the spend - the grants committee is 3/5 Ballers so we wanted to avoid the appearance of impropriety by going to them.

On that note, grants committee members also get paid 200 BAL per month liquid. Given I selected a full Ballery for myself and I also plan to serve on the grants committee, I will forfeit my grants payment back to the grants pool as a full Ballery alone is a significant amount.

## Specification

The liquid portion of the Ballery has been fully funded for the next 3 months, we only need to fund the vested portion of the payments this time. **Three months from now, I will make a proposal to fund both the liquid AND vested portions for the following three months.**

We need 5,400 BAL to fully fund vested Balleries for the next 3 months. I think it’s also important for the Ballers to have a spending fund we can use to reward community members who distinguish themselves on an ad-hoc basis and to run some community events like the POAP design competition. **Thus I will ask for an even 6,000 BAL with 5,400 going towards vested Ballers and 600 going to the Baller spending fund** (requires 2 ballers to agree, I custody funds secured by my ledger wallet).

I will coordinate setting up the vesting contracts with Fernando.",bullish
841,"##### ABSTRACT
The purpose of this proposal is to outline the framework for a voluntary, no-cost three-month pilot program aimed at pairing successful AIP authors with first-time (AIP) applicants to foster increased participation and enhance the overall quality of proposals submitted for voting.

AllCityBAYC will oversee the initiative independently, separate from the Governance Working Group, with the intention of presenting a proof-of-concept to the ApeCoinDAO community for further development once completed.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
1. Improve the quality of ApeCoinDAO grant proposals: The AIP Ambassador & Mentorship Program will refine grant proposals submitted to ApeCoinDAO, making them more structured, detailed, and in line with DAO goals.
2. Increase the success rate of ApeCoinDAO grant proposals: With programs like this, ApeCoinDAO can increase the amount of meaningful proposals being passed, leading to a more effective grant process and overall positive impact on our ecosystem.
3. Knowledge transfer and skill development: Mentors and mentorship programs pour the foundation for success and reduce learning curves.
4. Reduced barriers: The AIP Ambassador & Mentorship Program will eliminate or reduce barriers that obstruct individuals or groups from accessing opportunities, resources, or participating in the AIP grant proposal process stemming from a lack of ecosystem understanding or ineffective communication skills.
5. Community building: This program will develop a deeper sense of belonging, connection, and cooperation among ApeCoinDAO constituents and provide an inviting environment for newcomers who may be curious about writing AIPs.
6. Establish ApeCoinDAO as a recognized incubator for innovation: Developing ApeCoinDAO as a visible hub known for assisting community members foster innovative ideas will encourage creativity within the community, increase brand recognition and contribute to an overall strengthened reputation.

##### OVERALL COST 
There is no cost

title: Add DPI on Aave V2
status: WIP
author: Matthew Graham (@MatthewGraham)
shortDescription: Add DPI on Aave V2
discussions:  https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3576
created: 2021-07-19
---

## Simple Summary

Add DPI as collateral support for DPI to the Aave market. 

## Abstract

Add DPI to Aave V2 market.

The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) is a capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of decentralized financial assets across the market.

DPI is an ERC20 token that enables users to gain exposure to a basket of DeFi protocols via single transaction. The reduced volatility and broad diversification is a great property for collateral.

The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. DPI aims to track the projects in DeFi that have significant usage and show a commitment to ongoing maintenance and development. At the time of writing there are 14 tokens included in DPI. 

## Motivation

Aave would be the first major lending protocol to integrate an index product into its platform. DPI is becoming a DeFi standard and adding DPI would dramatically increase support for these efforts. 

There are over 12,000 DPI holders and growing. Adding DPI as collateral would bring users into the Aave ecosystem allowing capital, yield and value to accrue to Aave participants.

## Specification

DPI is a market capitalization weighted index product that follows a predetermined qualitative and quantitative methodology. The composition of the DPI portfolio is maintained by DeFi Pulse. 

The DPI token has no governance characteristics and is predominantly traded via the V2 Uniswap DPI-ETH pool. DPI is supported and maintained by Index Coop and is built on TokenSets infrastructure. 

At the time of writing, DPI has a market capitalization of greater than $220M and is the most readily traded DeFi index product.

There is an annual 95 basis point fee for holders of DPI that is split 70/30 between Index Coop and DeFi Pulse respectively. 

DPI-ETH earns INDEX rewards through liquidity mining, currently yielding upwards of 20% APR, in addition to around 5% in trading fee income with limited impermanent loss.

## Rationale

By purchasing DPI, users are able to gain exposure to leading DeFi protocols in the form of a single ERC20 token. The risk of holding just a select few protocols within a portfolio is diversified away, giving holders broad theme based exposure to DeFi.  

With Aave currently making up 20.88% of DPI, there is no better way for Aave to support DPI’s widespread adoption, than to enable DPI being utilized for borrowing and lending. With DPI trading since October 2020 and 90 day average trading volume of around $7.2M.

Additional information see Index Coop’s website: https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi

## Test Cases

Being a standard ERC20, the Aave protocol test cases already cover everything needed to support DPI. 

## Implementation

The implementations must be completed before any AIP is given status ""Implemented"", but it need not be completed before the AIP is ""Approved"". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of ""rough consensus and running code"" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

## DPI - Aave Risk Assessment 

Details can be found on the Aave governance forum post linked below.
https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3576/9

# Overal Risk Score: B-

The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) is an index product managed by Index Coop. At the time of writing there are 324,355 DPI in circulation. DPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions.

# DPI Smart Contract Risk: C-

DPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions.

# DPI Counterparty Risk: C

DPI is a product whereby holders of DPI have no metagovernance influence on Index Coop or the protocol within the index. DPI trades on the ethereum network and inherits the trust of the network much like USDC. DPI has over 12,055 holders and the DPI-ETH pool is Uniswap’s 17th largest at $90M. Anyone can Mint, Trade and Redeem DPI.

The DPI utilises TokenSets V2 smart contract has been audited by Open Zeppelin audit [September 4th, 2020] which identified privilege roles in many of the contracts. The key findings are highlighted below:

* The Controller contract has an owner that chooses the contracts that comprise the system. This includes all of the modules, resources and the factories that can be used to make Sets. 

* The IntegrationRegistry tracks third party integrations that can be used in the system. It also has an owner that can add, remove and edit the integrations as desired. 

* The PriceOracle has a list of oracles and adapters that can be used to retrieve third party prices. It also has an owner role that can choose the supported oracles, adapters and price pairs.

# DPI Market Risk: B-

DPI’s price tracks the Net Asset Value of the underlying assets, by holding a basket of protocol tokens the volatility of a single asset is dampened. This is reflected by DPI having a standard deviation of 5.75% since exception compared to ETH and AAVE which has a standard deviation of 5.03% and 7.79% respectively over the same time period (03/10/2021 to 01/05/2021). When considering liquidity, the average daily trading volume is $7.19M, based on over a trailing 90 day trading period. However, DPI holders have the option to mint/redeem the underlying tokens within DPI which draws on the liquidity of the underlying assets and also allows for any deviation from NAV to be arbitraged away by traders.

But all good things come to an end. Now I'm in the hospital, I have a lot of unpaid bills and a hacked wallet with my tokens.

At first I thought I would just sell my steaking to an acquaintance for 50% of the value to cover my loans. But we discovered that my wallet had been hacked. Since I am a developer and have a lot of experience in WEB3 I realize that I can bypass the sweeper.

There are several solutions:

1. We will reach the management of pancake, they will allow me to withdraw earlier, even if at 100% loss of rewards

2. Users who can help - donate funds to me, and I extend steaking for a year and give the private wallet key to you

849,"# **Summary**

This ARFC proposes the Aave DAO budget allocation on events at key ecosystem initiatives at EthCC and Devcon to help to reinforce Aave Protocol’s unique and positive culture, share technical knowledge, and attract new community members. These initiatives are aimed at helping to continue the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem by showcasing Aave Protocol’s core values. Thank you for reviewing this proposal and for your earlier questions and positive vote in the snapshot.

# **Motivation**

Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, contributors, and stakeholders.

Although the Aave Protocol has emerged as a leader within DeFi, the sector at large is still in its nascent stages, and Aave should work hard to retain its spot as a leader. For the events proposal from the DAO for 2024, Aave Labs wants to concentrate on proposing fewer but higher-quality events to maximize impact.

# **Specification**

Aave Labs is requesting a budget allocation for 650,000 GHO for events for the remainder of 2024 for EthCC Brussels (45%) and Devcon Bangkok (55%). These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:

1. Hackathons & Bounties: We want to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, and to remain visible and competitive in a growing industry, but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem. We propose to sponsor one ETHGlobal hackathon in Q4 in Bangkok.
2. Open Finance Day: We are hosting Open Finance Day in partnership with key players in DeFi for high quality talks, networking, and light bites. Talks will include members of the DeFi community, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members and service providers.
3. Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences is an opportunity to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge, and industry insights. Typically featuring panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts, side events are designed to strengthen awareness of Aave and GHO technology among strategic audiences, reach new target audiences, and ensure Aave and GHO remain top-of-mind within and outside the community.
4. Merch: Aave Labs seeks to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement and awareness-building efforts as well as to proliferate the new visual identity and the beloved Ronnie ghost. Aave Labs will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials and creation of merchandise people actually wear, use, and love.
5. rAAVE: To celebrate the Aave community’s welcoming culture, we aim to host two more editions of the flagship rAAVE event. Throughout the past years rAAVE has positioned itself to be the most sought after event in the ecosystem. They foster community spirit and create memorable experiences. We will integrate the GHO Pass for ticketing logistics and manage press relations and social media to maximize awareness and inclusion. This year’s events will be hosted at EthCC in Brussels and Devcon in Bangkok. To mitigate some costs for rAAVE, we are planning to potentially obtain co-sponsorship with current or potentially new partners for the Aave ecosystem. Due to the event’s high visibility, it is crucial that if co-sponsorship is obtained, the selected partners are aligned with the Aave Community and this is conducted in a balanced manner.

# **Activations**

| Name | Date | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rAAVE | July & Nov TBD | During the weeks of EthCC & Devcon. rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem. The plan is to host two rAAVEs during the course of this proposal. |
| Open Finance Day | July 9 | In partnership with Chainlink, Uniswap, and Aptos we would host an Open DeFi Day for talks, networking, and light bites during EthCC week. Talks will include members of those communities, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members. |
| ETHGlobal Bangkok | Nov 15-17 | Sponsorship of one ETHGlobal hackathon, ETHGlobal Bangkok, focusing on quality developers. |
| Devcon | Q4 | This will be the event of the year in the Ethereum community. Hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, this event will be one of the most attended web3 events of 2024. |
| Side Events | Q4 | Side events currently being considered include: SheFi Summit (Brussels, Singapore, Bangkok), DeFi Security Summit by Certora during Devcon, Stable Summit Brussels. Funds from any side events that are not confirmed will be rolled over to the next potential side event. |

After covering the aforementioned main sponsorships, any remaining budget will be directed towards side events related to the security of DeFi and smart contract technology. Any excess funds from this grant will be rolled over to be used for events during Q1 2025. A recap on last year’s events was posted to governance last December, here.

Aave Labs shall cover all expenses for its team members, and this proposal does not request any funds for these expenses, or include any compensation for Aave Labs’ work.

# **Next Steps**

- Secure community feedback on ARFC
- Snapshot vote
- If Snapshot is successful, then move to AIP

# **Conclusion**

We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of 650,000 GHO for activations and events for the remainder of 2024 will not only help enrich the Aave Protocol ecosystem, but will foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition.

We look forward to the DAO’s support for this proposal for these events during 2024.",neutral

854,"## Summary:

Proposal to add gauge support for a newly created wstETH/ACX pool on Ethereum.

The Across team and community have decided to coordinate around using Balancer as the primary liquidity hub, want to establish strong initial liquidity, and keep the Balancer pool as the core liquidity–as well as encourage communities to be long term LPs. In addition to the Across treasury providing some native ACX rewards to LPs, we are optimisticly establishing this gauge and enabling Balancer and Aura emissions will help this become a strong sustainable liquidity solution for the protocol and community.

• Communities https://discord.gg/across

• Other useful links? https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocol

## Protocol Description:

Across is an optimistic insured bridge that relies on a decentralized group of relayers to fulfill user deposit requests from EVM to EVM networks. Relayer funds are insured by liquidity providers in a single pool on Ethereum and refunds are processed via the UMA Optimistic Oracle.

Designed by the engineers who built UMA, Across was the result of approaching bridging not only as a technical concern but as a financial engineering concern.

## Motivation:

Across’ goal is to become the most-used bridge in Web3. Previously we have listed BAL as a bridgeable asset on Across and this is another step in strengthening the relationship between the two protocols. In addition, this pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for Across and its ACX token. Overall, this will further the relationship between protocols and create a great liquidity solution for Across.

Specifications:

1. Governance: The Across governance model can be found here: https://docs.across.to/governance/governance-model. The current multi-sig setup will be replaced with an optimistic governance tool that was created by UMA and Snapshot in the next few months, provided that it is in production as planned.

2. Oracles: Across is secured by UMA’s optimistic oracle. More information can be found here: https://docs.umaproject.org/protocol-overview/how-does-umas-oracle-work#optimistic-oracle

3. Audits: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/uma-across-v2-audit/

4. Centralization vectors: Across’s rebalancing is done by a bot that is run by the foundation. Presently the bot is not profitable to run, so we would not expect anyone else to run it. However, there is no chance of money being inaccessible as a result of the bot stopping–Just that the bridge would run less efficiently.

Otherwise, no other centralization vectors listed apply to Across.
5. Market History: ACX has recently launched and doesn't have much market history at this time. Gauge address is 0x89F65570Ac019f86E145c501023e2ef7010D155B. Pool address is 0x798b112420AD6391A4129Ac25eF59663a44C88bB.

6. Value: This pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for Across and the ACX token. In addition, Across sees value in alignment with others in the ecosystem and sees potential and value in doing so with Balancer",bullish

For every user participating in the game challenge, 1 Cake would be burned. 

This token burn mechanism helps maintain the scarcity of Cake and adds an element of risk to the game.

title: [BIP-85] Redeem TRIBE
status: Proposed
author: @llama - @Matthew_Graham
created: 03-10-2022

---

# Summary

In response to recent events at Tribe DAO, this proposal presents the Balancer community the opportunity to redeem its TRIBE holding for a combination of stETH, LQTY, FOX and DAI after conditions of the pending veBAL transaction vote are met, [5]. Upon receipt the LQTY, FOX and DAI is to be converted to USDC.

# Abstract

With Fei Lab announcing a 5th October voting date for the Tribe DAO veBAL holding sale and a positive voting outcome expected, Llama proposes Balancer DAO redeems the TRIBE holding for an estimated $640.5K after 1M DAI from the FEI Peg Stability Module (PSM) has been made available to the TRIBE Redeemer contract.

Balancer DAO holds 2.8M units of TRIBE in the Treasury which can be redeemed for 308.04 stETH, 6,729.56 LQTY, 993,593.68 FOX and 189,047.55 DAI worth an estimated $634,366.29 at spot prices, [1, 2]. After a successful vote and token swap between Tribe DAO and Aave Companies, Balancer DAO’s TRIBE holding will receive an additional 6,113 units of DAI when redeemed. This is based upon the 21.80 units of DAI per 10,000 units of TRIBE exchange rate mentioned by Fei Labs on Tribe DAO’s governance forum, [1]. 

As Balancer’s Snapshot will start after Tribe DAO Tally vote, Balancer DAO will be positioned to redeem TRIBE soon after the veBAL transaction is complete. Do note, Lama is in direct contact with Fei labs, Tribe DAO and Aave Companies and will be able to provide updates as and when needed. If the vote is to not pass in favour, then no action is to be taken.

# Motivation

With Tribe DAO’s TIP-121 vote passing, the protocol has entered a terminal state as outlined below, [3]:

* FEI becomes wrapped DAI, redeemable 1:1 and fully backed specifically by DAI
* TRIBE becomes redeemable for a pro-rata claim on each remaining asset after setting aside DAI backing for FEI. Notably this excludes all TRIBE in the Tibre DAO Treasury

As Balancer DAO has already dissolved its FEI holding, only the remaining TRIBE holding needs to be redeemed for the underlying assets held within the PCV. The redeem contract for TRIBE token holders was deployed on the 25th September 2022. TRIBE can now be redeemed for stETH, LQTY, FOX and DAI, [4].

When Aave Companies has escrowed their 1M DAI, Tribe DAO will transfer 1M DAI from the FEI PSM to the TRIBE Redeem contract allowing TRIBE holders to access the 1M DAI immediately. Once this has occurred, Llama recommends Balancer DAO redeems the full TRIBE holding. The difference between Balance DAO redeeming now or after the additional 1M DAI deposit into the TRIBE Redeem contract is an estimated 6,104 DAI.

Once the LQTY, FOX and DAI assets are received, they are to be transferred to the Liquidity Mining Multisig where they will be converted to USDC then transferred back to the main treasury wallet. The DAI is to be converted to USDC via Maker DAO’s USDC PSM and the other assets swapped.

Further details can be found on Tribe DAO governance forum.

We believe that an ApeCoin newsletter that is developed and distributed by the community would be a beneficial source of information for members for the DAO. The newsletter could be developed on Substack, Ghost, MailChimp or a similar platform. It should be an aggregation of ApeCoin specific ecosystem news, AIPs, conversations, opportunities and content sourced from Discourse, Discord, Twitter and other internet destinations. The newsletter should promote and educate all things related to the ApeCoin DAO.

title: [ARFC] GHO - Increase Borrow Rate
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & ACI - @MarcZeller
created: 2023-10-30

---

# Summary

This publication proposes increasing the GHO Borrow Rate from 3.00% to 4.72%, the proposed sDAI rate.

# Motivation

Over the past week, the GHO peg has been gradually declining, while the supply has been increasing. Users have been minting GHO and subsequently exchanging it for other assets.

Incremental interest rate hikes have not had the desired effect, evident by GHO price continuing to trade lower. The GHO borrowing rate remains significantly lower compared to other stablecoins.

This publication suggests aligning the GHO borrowing rate with the proposed sDAI rate, 4.72%. The aim is to reduce the borrowing discount of GHO relative to other stablecoins before returning to periodic 50bps increases.

The chart below shows the general GHO price downwards trend. 

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByIPGWaz6.png)

The below shows the borrow rate of GHO relative to other stable coins. 

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryZgQWazp.png)

The main types of collateral backing GHO are wstETH (29.68%), wETH (28.84%), wBTC (20.44%) and rETH (8.94%). For reference, sDAI makes up 2.07% of the collateral supporting GHO debt with a current APR of [5.0%](https://daistats.com/#/ecosystem) which is expected to adjust lower to 4.72%. A large portion of the collateral backing GHO is generating yield which acts to offset borrowing costs.

By increasing the borrow rate to 4.72%, the goal is to improve the peg by reducing the incentive to mint GHO relative to other stable coins. As a result, GHO's growth is expected to slow. This publication prioritises returning GHO to peg over growth. 

After implementing this proposal, the community can continue with the current plan, [direct-to-AIP process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/349/).

867,"One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing this proposals is that **we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.**

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and **give them to farms that are providing the most value.**

### Hopefully, this example might be better:
- Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)

*1x multiplier removed from under performing farm*

- Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)

**So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.**

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 30-day volume, unique token holders on BSC etc.

title: [ARFC] Avalanche wAVAX Interest Rate Upgrade
Author: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham)
Dated: 2023-02-03

---

# Summary

@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend the wAVAX interest rate parameters on the Aave Avalanche v3 Liquidity Pool.

# Abstract

Llama is working with Chaos Labs to revise the sAVAX risk parameters needed to enable more funds to flow into the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX on Avalanche v3 Liquidity Pool. This proposal will focus on revising the AVAX interest rate parameters with the goal of improving the capital efficiency of the wAVAX reserve and increasing Aave’s wAVAX revenue.

With a revised higher SupplyCap on sAVAX, we expect this to lead to an increase in the adoption of the recursive yield strategy. Increasing the availability of wAVAX supports the growth in TVL and revenue accruing to Aave with the sAVAX SupplyCap becoming the primary means limiting the adoption of the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX.

# Motivation

Llama has been in discussions with various parties to develop a yield curve that supports adoption of the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX on Avalanche v3. The strategy is modelled to be attractive whilst the utilisation of the wAVAX reserve is less than the Uoptimal point.

Interest Rate at the Uoptimal point is calculated as shown below.

Base + Slope1 = 70% x (LST Yield + sAVAX Deposit Incentives / 2) / ( 98% x sAVAX eMode LTV)

Base + Slope1 = 70% x (7.2% + 0.41% / 2) / (98% x 92.5%)) = 4.72%

This approach reflects the following considerations:

* Deposit rewards on sAVAX significantly affect the profitability of the strategy by offsetting wAVAX borrowing costs
  * Yield earned is sAVAX yield (7.2%) + deposit incentives (0.41%)
* sAVAX deposit rewards are diluted with more deposits, ie: 50% growth in sAVAX deposits.
* Recursive strategy operates narrowly within the LTV of sAVAX eMode TVL
  * 98% of the 92.5% LTV via Avax Correlated eMode
* Recursive strategy is only attractive whilst generate supportive risk adjusted yield
  * Looping 6 times generates around double the LST yield at Uoptimal utilisation, this is how the 70% figure is derived. This does not takes into consideration leverage transaction costs which could lead up to 1.5% of the principle and incur a 2-3 week break even period. It is assume users stay within the strategy for an extended period of time.

The current recursive strategy sAVAX/wAVAX is generating around 23.9% with a low wAVAX utilisation due to the SupplyCap for sAVAX has been reached. This yield will fall as the wAVAX utilisation increases. Assuming the SupplyCap for sAVAX is doubled, the current wAVAX interest rate curve becomes the limiting factor on the profitability of the strategy. The SupplyCap on wAVAX has a utilisation of 24.35% and offers considerable deposit capacity. There was no BorrowCap for wAVAX at the time this proposal was drafted.

To reduce the volatility in the borrow rate between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal, a Base of 1% is introduced whilst keeping the Base + Slope1 interest rate as calculated above. This generates a Slope1 of 4.72%.

Adjusting the Uoptimal parameter improved the capital efficiency of the AVAX reserve. Adjusting from 45% to 65% is a substantial increase. The current utilisation is a lot lower, 28.49% and is expected to increase substantially, possibly 56.98% when the sAVAX SupplyCap is to be doubled. This is still short of the 65% Uoptimal parameter and offers users an attractive yield on the strategy. With future SupplyCap increases, the Uoptimal parameter can be revised. With a Uoptimal of 65%, there remain sufficient liquidity in the reserve to liquidate users. It is also worth noting a $5.055m USDC swap for wAVAX incurs a 2% price impact via 1inch.

The Slope2 parameter has been reduced from 300% to 144.28% to generate a borrow rate of 150% at 100% utilisation. This reduced the volatility when utilisation is in the Uoptimal < Utilisation <100% range. When utilisation is in this range the recursive strategy is not generating sufficient reward relative to holding sAVAX and will lead to strategy reducing leverage and therefore utilisation of the wAVAX reserve. Because of this relationship a gradual increase in borrowing interest is preferable and thus a lower Slope2 parameter can be implemented.

# Specification

The following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama.

|Parameter|Proposed Value|
| --- | --- |
|Variable Base|1.00%|
|Uoptimal|65.00%|
|Variable Slope1|4.72%|
|Variable Slope2|144.28%|
|Stable Borrowing |Disabled|
|Stable Slope1 |4.72%|
|Stable Slope2 |144.28%|
|Base Stable Rate Offset |4%|
|Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5%|
|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20%|

Stable rates have been updated to mitigate any risk of enabling stable borrowing and having a variable borrow rate greater than the stable borrowing rate.

872,"This proposal is also on [Balancer's Forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-increase-gno-cap-from-cap3-to-cap4-10m-30m/706).

# TL;DR

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). GNO adjusted liquidity has been consistently greater than $10m since December 2020.

# The Proposal

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M).

At the time of writing GNO has over $22M in total liquidity on Balancer Pools, and has thus surpassed its $10M cap.

Gnosis hopes to further strengthen synergies with Balancer in light of the upcoming launch of Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator. V2 channels orders to underlying on-chain AMMs for execution and hopes to be integrating Balancer as one of its first partners.

As Gnosis has contributed liquidity for multiple Balancer pools, Gnosis currently holds 52,146 BAL. Gnosis holds and continues to earn a significant amount of BAL tokens which it intends to transfer to GnosisDAO to hold as an investment, instead of selling in the open market.

[Balancer is currently the most liquid exchange for GNO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gnosis) and it would be good to keep incentivizing it to avoid the fragmentation of its liquidity. The GNO token migration to other exchanges could potentially reduce Balancer’s competitive advantage of having the lowest fee and slippage for GNO/ETH pairs.

# What is GNO?

GNO is the governance token of [GnosisDAO](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosisdao-a7102fcf9224), which launched Nov 23rd 2020 and has since seen significant growth in community engagement. It currently has a $164M market cap.

GnosisDAO owns several core Ethereum infrastructure components such as the Gnosis Safe which currently holds [more than 2% of the total ETH supply](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/ul0PgNtcq9MwezZThlHrgOMEIzpvEmkdwA9XoVqi). GnosisDAO will soon launch Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator that channels liquidity to on-chain AMMs such as Balancer.",bullish
873,"## Goal of the vote

0x Labs would like to gather signal from the community on support for the proposed Metatransaction and Multiplex upgrades as proposed in [ZEIP-96](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/96).

## Scope

The forum post on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-96-metatransactionsfeaturev2-and-multiplex-upgrades/3543](https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-96-metatransactionsfeaturev2-and-multiplex-upgrades/3543).

In summary, the proposed changes will provide two main benefits: (1) improve gas efficiency of the metatransaction feature and (2) enable OTC order formats to be included in multihop transactions that would expand the sources of liquidity that can be considered and make meta-aggregation more price competitive.

A subsequent vote (ZEIP-96) will be conducted if this temperature check is successful to integrate the proposed smart contract changes to the `exchangeProxy`.

Title: [ARFC] New Chain Deployment Framework
Author: @0xTogbe - Aave Chan Initiative
Created: 2023-11-28
---

# Summary

This proposal seeks the community’s approval for a framework to deploy the Aave Protocol on a new blockchain.
This framework outlines the standardized process for any blockchain seeking to deploy on Aave Protocol. The goal is to establish a transparent and community-driven approach for evaluating and deploying new Aave v3 instances.

# Motivation
New chain deployments are a key part of the growth path for Aave v3, but the current end-to-end process is not always clear and subject to extended timelines. In addition, there is no specific process for prioritizing deployments on chains that will offer standing deposits like protocol-owned-liqudity, liquidity mining incentives, or other benefits for Aave protocol and our users. For example, Aave v3’s recent deployment on Gnosis Chain has benefited from deposits from Gnosis Chain’s DAO liquidity base.

We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead, while allowing Aave to benefit from collaboration with partners from new blockchain development teams. The new deployment framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for moving forward with new instances of the Aave protocol. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.

By establishing clear guidelines, the proposal aims to create an inclusive and efficient environment for new chain deployments, while maximizing the weight of Aave’s brand name and clear benefits from an Aave v3 deployment for new chain ecosystems.

# Specification
The current governance process for new deployments is as follows:

- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days
- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)
- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days
- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)
- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)

We propose to keep the same steps, but introduce a more clear timeline and requirements for moving between proposal stages.

Updated timeline and requirements:

- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days
- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)
- Documentation submission:
- 7 days after the Snapshot vote
     If deadline is not met, there will be a frozen period of 30 days. 
     After that period documentation could be analyzed again
- Technical review duration
     21 days since documentation submitted
     If technical review fails due to security concerns, process will be frozen until 
     it’s been resolved.
- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days, after technical review has been successfully completed
- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)
- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)

877,"##### ABSTRACT
AIP ID #420 holds special importance within the crypto industry and the Ape community.

This proposal seeks to temporarily reserve AIP ID #420 to create a meaningful impact for the DAO. The proposal team would collaborate with the community to organize a competition where the winner is awarded AIP ID #420 and an ApeCoin grant.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The community engagement resulting from the decision and the decision-making process may enhance cohesion, excitement, and involvement among ApeCoin holders. This proposal would preserve the cultural significance of AIP-420 within the ApeCoin DAO.

##### OVERALL COST 
This proposal requests 420,000 ApeCoin from the DAO’s Ecosystem Fund for the community contest. The winner of the contest will be awarded with AIP #420 and a reasonable grant not exceeding 420,000 ApeCoin.

TLDR: We want to save AIP ID #420 to help give it a chance to create a meaningful impact for the DAO. The community would have a contest to award the AIP ID #420 along with a grant, this would be the first step to help ensure AIP ID #420 doesn’t end up in the Rejected AIPs folder.

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. 

In addition, this ARC proposes adjusting two (2) total risk parameters, including LTV and Liquidation Threshold, across one (1) Aave Arc (Fireblocks) asset.

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Following the recent market crash, our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for LINK and WETH.** 

These parameter updates also represent Gauntlet's first set of parameter updates for the Aave Arc market.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification

Our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. 


| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| LINK Loan To Value     | 70%     | 67%     |
| LINK Liquidation Bonus    | 6.3%     | 5.0%     |
| **LINK Liquidation Threshold**     | 78%     | ***75%***     |
| WBTC Loan To Value     | 70%     | 69%     |
| WBTC Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 5.0%     |
| WBTC Liquidation Threshold     | 75%     | 76%     |
| WETH Loan To Value     | 82.5%     | 81%     |
| WETH Liquidation Bonus    | 5.0%     | 4.0%     |
| **WETH Liquidation Threshold**     | 85%     | ***83%***     |



See below volatility and exchange volume data from 05/13 to 05/26. These are valuable metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. 

|Symbol| 05-26 Volatility| 05-13 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| LINK   | 	  1.560317105       |  1.407103695  | 	0.15321341   |  -67.2106437    |

## Aave Arc (Fireblocks) Parameter Changes Specification

Our simulation platform indicates that increasing the capital efficiency of USDC collateral does not meaningfully increase the risk of insolvencies. Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| USDC Loan To Value     | 85.5%     | 87.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Threshold     | 88%     | 90%     |




## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

886,"#### ABSTRACT

With NFT Embed, ApeCoin DAO can own the marketplace of choice for ecosystem assets and other curated projects. NFT Embed is a free tool from Graviton, providing Shopify and Stripe functionality for NFTs. NFT Embed is free to use; Graviton will deploy an initial marketplace for ApeCoin DAO.

Marketplace fee: 0.30%, including a 0.30% base fee and a 0.00% finder’s fee. The finder’s fee amount and recipient is customizable, by collection, and can be ‘turned on’ when ApeCoin DAO has infrastructure and processes to accept revenue.

NFT Embed is powered by Universe’s decentralized, open-source, audited 1 2 marketplace that supports any collection and major tokens including $APE. Building with trustless, customizable solutions mitigates counter-party risks and compounds economic benefits attributable to marketplace ownership.

#### OVERALL COST 

NFT Embed is free to use.

Upon approval, Graviton has committed to providing and managing a domain for this marketplace, which will be communicated to ApeCoin DAO upon release. The marketplace will support Ecosystem assets (for those collections that are released before the marketplace is live), as defined, and launch with the 0.30% marketplace fee and 0% finder’s fee.

**Intro**
Same as previous post. Currently PERP is at $3m cap, there is $14m liquidity currently and is relatively stable over last couple of days so don’t expect any more updates after this.

Below is the same copy/paste from previous post. The only thing I would add is that given the whole Bitmex issue they have lost about 10k BTC in open interest which will be very interesting where that volume goes. If Perp can capture it (being the only usd settled perpetual future in dex which is the same mechanism as btc perp in Bitmex) then we want to capture this liquidity first!

**What is PERP**
Perpetual is a new project that could bring a lot of trading volume to balancer. They provide perpetual futures contracts that are based in USD. This is different to protocols such as dydx where the base token may be in ETH or a native token traded - this is a massive differentiation point given a lot of the large trading volume exchanges such as Bitmex, binance and deribit denominate in USD.

The PERP token is planned to have distributions back to token holders through a percentage of trading fees which provides a mechanism to encourage trading volume",bearish

897,"#### Axelar - Farms Optimization

Dear CAKE holders, to improve trading conditions and CAKE buyback, we are optimizing CAKE emission to the current Axelar farms - axlUSDC-USDT and AXL-USDT on BNB Chain.

By redirecting CAKE from underperforming to high-performing Axelar farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This ensures CAKE is distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner for CAKE holders.**

#### The Farms

📝 Please note: There is **no change** in the total amount of CAKE incentives we will be directing towards the Axelar farms:

| Farm          | Previous Multiplier | New Multiplier | Change |
|:--------------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| axlUSDC-USDT (BSC) | 3.7x | 5.1x | +1.4x |
| AXL-USDT (BSC)   | 3.3x | 1.7x | -1.6x |

We propose to increase the farm multiplier of axlUSDC-USDT (Stableswap) on BSC to **5.1x CAKE rewards**, while decreasing the farm multiplier of AXL-USDT (0.25%) on BSC to **1.7x CAKE rewards**. This will be executed shortly after the end of the vote proposal, if it passes.

We request for further flexibility in the multipliers and duration of the Axelar farms. The aggregate CAKE emission to these farms will remain the same, but we may adjust the multipliers and duration of the farms to ensure high utilization rates, ultimately maximizing CAKE burn from trading volume.

898,"**Summary:**

A proposal by the Mechanism.Capital 13 team to create a Curve Metapool for Empty Set Dollar (ESD) and the 3Pool stablecoins (USDC, USDT, and DAI).

ESD has been one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins launched to date. Its market capitalization has grown to over $65 million in the ~2 months since its inception (peaked near $100 million).

The unique mechanism design of the protocol makes it a strong candidate to become one of the largest stable collateral assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

Creating an ESD metapool would attract more liquidity to the Curve platform and lead to increased trading fees.

Learn more about metapools here: https://resources.curve.fi/faq/base-and-metapools 1

**Abstract:**

Empty Set Dollar (ESD) is a new algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin that utilizes fixed protocol rules on supply expansion as well as a unique coupon creation + redemption model to incentivize trustless coordination between selfish participants that maintain ESD’s synthetic peg 1:1 with the US dollar all on-chain. Unlike other algorithmic stable coins like AMPL, ESD does not rebase all balances using non-standard functions, but instead adjusts supply through other mechanisms, allowing ESD to have the same composability as other standard ERC20 tokens.

Currently, crypto lacks a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoin. While DAI and sUSD come close, they currently have vulnerabilities in their architecture. The goal of ESD is to create a truly permissionless, scaleable, stable store of value, that can be used as superfluid collateral in DeFi.

Note: ESD currently only incentivizes the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool. In order to motivate more liquidity to flow to this Curve metapool, ESD holders would have to vote to upgrade ESD to incentivize this new pool. However, various ESD community members have already expressed their support for such a prospective proposal to reward Curve LPs.

*Liquidity:*

Total Uniswap Liquidity as of 11/3/2020: $1.52 million

Avg. Daily Trading Volume (Last 14 Days ended 11/3/2020): $3.75 million

*Token Holder Distribution:*

As of 11/4/2020 there are currently over 853 unique addresses holding ESD. This includes 668 staked addresses.

Over 90% of ESD tokens were staked to the DAO as of 11/3/2020.

**Motivation:**

This is an opportunity for Curve to attract more liquidity to its platform and increase trading fees. It would also benefit the ESD community by increasing the efficiency of ESD turnover and accelerating ESD contraction & expansion cycles to further stabilize the price of the token around $1. Finally, accelerating the growth of ESD would enhance the antifragility of the entire DeFi ecosystem due to ESD’s unique characteristics relative to other stable assets.

**Specification:**

This metapool would include ESD, USDC, USDT, and DAI. It is likely that the ESD protocol community would vote to incentivize this Curve metapool. It already does this for the ESD/USDC pool on Uniswap: https://emptyset.finance/#/pool/

**For:**

This pool would bring more liquidity and fees to the Curve protocol.

It would also help accelerate and dampen the volatility ESD’s expansion/contraction cycles, which are currently delayed due to the limitations of slippage on the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool.

Successful passage of this proposal would show the Curve community’s willingness to support new, innovative protocols – specifically those focused on open and permissionless access to DeFi.

**Against:**

ESD is a relatively new and experimental protocol. There are both known and unknown risks to explore as the protocol matures. These include, but are not limited to:

ESD is expected to trade within a narrow band around US$1.00, but has experienced short periods of significant volatility

A downward spiral in the instance of zero demand for new coupons (though in the current contraction period, over 26m coupons have been purchased)

Smart contract bugs (code is currently under audit); and

A design flaw that leads to an economic attack (see the recent Harvest Finance attack 1).

899,"# Proposal to Increase CAKE Trading Fee Buyback and Burn

One of the key goals of the kitchen has always been to make CAKE emissions-neutral and eventually deflationary. This goal can be achieved by emission reductions, and also increasing the amount of CAKE we burn. Therefore, we are proposing to utilize more trading fees to support the CAKE buyback and burn mechanism. We are proposing to do this via reallocating some of the portion of the trading fees that goes to our treasury to the CAKE trading fee buyback and burn. 

Right now, of the 0.25% trading fee, 0.05% of the fee is sent towards CAKE buyback and burn. We propose to **increase the buyback and burn allocation to 0.0575%, with the extra 0.0075% coming out of our treasury allocation - reducing the CAKE trading fee allocation that enters the treasury from 0.03% to 0.0225%**. 

If this proposal passes, we aim to implement this change by the next burn. We will also have a 2-day voting period for this proposal.

|Trading Fee Allocations|Current|Proposed|% Change|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|CAKE Buyback & Burn|0.0500%|0.0575%|+15%|
|PCS Treasury|0.0300%|0.0225%|-25%|
|LP Fees|0.017%|0.017% |No change|
|**Total**|**0.25%**|**0.25%** |**No change**|
 

## Read Before Voting

Before you vote, please make sure you understand the long and short term effects that changes to token swap trading fee allocations can have on CAKE Tokenomics.

- Read and digest the [**CAKE Tokenomics documentation**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics) and [**Trading Fee documentation**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/pancakeswap-exchange/trade) first
- Read this proposal in full
- Make up your mind, and cast your vote!

## Recap: Token Swap Trading Fees!

When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a **0.25% trading fee**, of which:

- 0.17% - Returned to Liquidity Pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.
- 0.03% - Sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury.
- 0.05% - Sent towards CAKE buyback and burn.

**Example:** When you buy $100 worth of CAKE using BNB, you pay **$0.25**, of which:
- $0.17 goes towards CAKE-BNB LPs, 
- $0.03 is sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury, and 
- $0.05 is sent towards CAKE buyback and burn.
    

#### Why Burn CAKE?

The end goal of burning CAKE is to reduce net CAKE emissions, ultimately making CAKE “emission neutral” or “deflationary”. That means, on average, the amount of CAKE burnt per block will be more than the amount of CAKE minted.



## Voting Options:

CAKE holders can vote for any one of these options at the bottom of this page.

901,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-stopping-the-bal-for-gas-initiative/2282).

## Background
The BAL for Gas initiative was introduced as a measure to entice and help users interested in trading ERC-20 tokens through the Balancer trading platform.

The introduction of the Gnosis partnership, however, will allow users to trade without requiring ETH for gas, so the gas reimbursement program becomes obsolete.

The initial proposal by @rabmarut can be found [here.](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705)

## Core Proposal
Given the conditions outlined above, I propose stopping this initiative with immediate effect.

## Risk Assessment
The halting of this program might result in a reduction in trading activity, from those first-time users not familiar with Balancer inner mechanisms (claiming function and Gnosis).

The intention behind this initiative is to enhance the diversity of assets on Aave and bolster liquidity within the ecosystem.

### Motivation:

eETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer. As of February 3rd, approximately 290,310 ETH ($670M) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi 1](http://ether.fi/) protocol, and XX has been natively restaked in EigenLayer.

[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) stands as the pioneering decentralized and non-custodial delegated staking protocol featuring an LRT (eETH). A notable feature of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is the control it provides stakers over their keys. The team behind the protocol is guided by the following principles:

1. Decentralization is the foremost objective. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is unwavering in its commitment to maintain the protocol's non-custodial and decentralized nature, ensuring that stakers always have control over their ETH.
2. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) operates as a legitimate business with a sustainable revenue model, with the team dedicated to its long-term success. There is no place for deceptive or unsustainable financial practices.
3. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is committed to always acting in the best interest of the Ethereum community. In the event of any missteps, the team at [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) will take responsibility and swiftly rectify the situation.

Risks:

[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)’s LRT eETH is 100% redeemable. Users who deposit ETH into the protocol can withdraw their stake at any time. The holdings are publicly auditable on-chain and the protocol retains healthy reserves to offset any losses.

## Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:

Anyone who deposits weETH into Aave will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)  and EigenLayer points to be used for future incentives.

Users are given eETH on a 1:1 basis with a minimum deposit of 0.001 ETH. 

[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity (weETH) to various platforms.

909,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to hire a Head of Network Development to help oversee matters within theAPE Foundation, supporting our community in achieving its strategic goals and ensuring operational excellence. The Head of Network Development will be responsible for supporting daily operations, facilitating strategic planning, coordinating community engagement, and
representing the DAO in external affairs. Additionally, this role will be well-positioned to make recommendations for further improvements as needed. For clarity’s sake, this position does not equate to a chief executive officer or “leader”, but rather a critical support function for the APE Foundation and the DAO.

To optimize efficiency and create cost savings, this proposal also includes a proposed reduction in future Special Council members’ payments to offset the cost of this hire. The APE Foundation will be empowered to oversee the hiring process for this position, ensuring that all legal, tax, and other relevant considerations are thoroughly addressed and optimized. The Head of Network Development will serve at the pleasure of the Special Council, the DAO’s Advisory Board.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
As ApeCoin DAO continues to expand, the need for ongoing, dedicated, and professional support at the APE Foundation has become increasingly evident. A Head of Network Development will offer essential oversight, strategic facilitation, and operational management, ensuring the ApeCoin DAO fulfills its mission efficiently and effectively. This role is vital for maintaining momentum, building community trust, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the DAO. Additionally, this position will allow our Special Council to focus on their responsibilities as the Advisory Board they are intended to be.

##### OVERALL COST 
USD $120,000 per annum paid in $APE. However, we will reduce Special Council member payments to offset this cost. Effectively makes this proposal zero additional cost to the DAO up to USD $125,000 once the reduction of the Special Council members payments kicks in (January 1, 2025).

APE Foundation could use its discretionary authority to go over USD $125,000 per annum if a competitive salary for this role is deemed necessary.

911,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes PearDAO ($PEX) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with PearDAO! A DAO managed decentralized marketplace that aims to allow the trade of all things in a free, open and independent trading ecosystem. PearDAO is built for the community and Web3 – dedicated to the exchange of values between off-chain, on-chain and cross-chain environments, all at once.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn PEX tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 334,000 PEX
 - **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on March 31st 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on April 30th 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.3865 PEX 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the PEX Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a PEX-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the farm period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.

#### What is $PEX?

From the team: “All trades on PearDAO are facilitated by PEX tokens. PEX also acts as the governance token to allow all holders to take part in building and managing the PearDAO platform.

* **Earn**: Fees collected by the network will be distributed among all PearDAO traders as trading rewards   
* **Stake**: Stake PEX tokens to earn in the PearDAO Farm, such as PEX-BNB LP Pool and PEX Pool (Coming Soon)
* **Governance**: PEX holders can propose and vote to determine the platform’s future development
* **Payment**: PEX tokens act as the utility token to submit appeals to the DAO members and to prioritize users’ ad ranking on the PearDAO Marketplace through ad spot bidding”

**Title:** [ARFC] Add ARB to Arbitrum Aave v3
**Author:** @fig - Flipside Crypto
**Created** : 2023-05-26

---
## Abstract

This proposal is the next step to add ARB to Aave v3 on Arbitrum.

## Summary

Following the successful [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x058f8e69b69a27495ee9796fc6952326d94eb24fe0071050db166d5d5e1da242) to add Aave v3 on Arbitrum, this  proposal progresses the asset listing to the next stage in the Governance cycle, incorporating parameters provided by Risk  Managers.

## Motivation

Adding support for ARB in Arbitrum v3 pools adds greater TVL and user experience to the increasingly popular Aave v3 Arbitrum market - and additional revenue opportunities for Aave.

By enabling borrowing, it allows users and institutions to take a unique position on this Governance token as the network matures and builds a decentralized community.

Furthermore, it more closely aligns the Aave community with Arbitrum and, by extension, Ethereum.

Additionally, it allows for creative uses of ARB received by the DAO to seed initial liquidity.

## Specifications

ARB may be listed with the following risk parameters:

|Parameter|Value|
| --- | --- |
|Isolation Mode|Yes|
|Borrowable|Yes|
|Collateral Enabled|Yes|
|Supply Cap (ARB)|20M|
|Borrow Cap (ARB)|16.5M|
|Debt Ceiling|$14M|
|LTV|50.00%|
|LT|60.00%|
|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|
|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|
|Reserve Factor|20.00%|
|Variable Base|0.00%|
|Variable Slope1|7.00%|
|Variable Slope2|300.00%|
|Uoptimal|45%|
|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|

Thank you to both @ChaosLabs and @Gauntlet for delivering speedy recommendations.

## Disclaimer

The information provided above about ARB is from public sources and Flipside Crypto cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.

The Arbitrum Foundation or Offchain Labs has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and we are doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.

This ARFC has been prepared solely to promote further discussion, evaluate presented risk parameters, and finalize the proposal before heading to the AIP stage.

917,"Gauge Proposal Template:

**Summary:**
> This pool uses the new weighted pool factory which allows Balancer to apply the protocol fee to rETH's yield. This gauge would be introduced as a ""core pool"" under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. In addition, any RPL collected by the `ProtocolFeeCollector` would also be directed towards bribing on this pool. We currently have ~$60k RPL in the fee collector which Balancer can use to bootstrap initial TVL, thus kick starting the flywheel here. It is also likely that Rocket Pool will assist with some incentives on their side. This gauge is enterring without a cap.

**References/Useful links:**

    • [Website](https://rocketpool.net/)

    • [Github Page](https://docs.rocketpool.net/developers/usage/contracts/contracts.html#introduction)    
    • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool)

**Protocol Description:**

> rETH represents liquid staked ETH. RPL is the governance token for Rocket Pool. 

**Motivation:**

> Balancer's near term focus is increasing TVL of yield bearing assets like RPL. With the new weighted pool factory we have the opportunity to also stimulate more trading activity in these yield bearing tokens. Given Rocket Pool has begun heavily bribing for rETH pools and Balancer aims to support the expansion of rETH, it is natural that we should attempt to secure more trading of RPL. Currently we will only be competing with uni-v3 so I expect interest and uptake to be strong here.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Please see this [guide](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1) which outlines Rocket Pool's DAO structure. 

2. **Oracles:** This pool will rely on a rate provider which has been in use for the rETH/ETH pool for some time. You can see it [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a8F81c256aee9C640e14bB0453ce247ea0DFE6F). 

3. **Audits:** See [here](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-4-2635c44e4f7e).

4. **Centralization vectors:** Rocket Pool is a [protocol for decentralized and trustless ETH2 staking](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd).

5. **Market History:** See [coingecko page](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth).
 
6. **Value:** Balancer will soon be the top destination for rETH liquidity on Ethereum if we aren't already. In order to boost our protocol revenue from this liquidity we need to stimulate rETH trading activity. RPL being the governance token of rETH seems a natural first step for a non-correlated pairing. RPL has seen significant trading interest going into the merge and this would be the first incentivized RPL liquidity pool on Ethereum as far as I know.

920,"Gauge Proposal Template:

**Summary:**

Add a a gauge for MAI/USDC on Ethereum.

**References/Useful links:**

> Link to: (cant put more than 2 links on a proposal, so linked in a reply)


**Protocol Description:**

MAI is the most crosschain decentralized stablecoin. It is overcollateralized by decentralized collaterals. MAI has been tested and maintained its peg during several market downturns, notably in May 2022.

The protocol is currently the #1 external use case for BAL on Polygon. It also incentivizes the main Balancer stablecoin pool on Polygon as well as other pools on Arbitrum and Fantom (Beethoven).

**Motivation:**

MAI is the only means to bridge large sums of capital across the broader crosschain universe. This is a good opportunity for Balancer to capture volume from whales bridging in and out of Ethereum.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    

MAI is controlled by a DAO. More info can be found here: https://docs.mai.finance/tokenomics-1/qi-token

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

We use Chainlink oracles to price collateral assets.

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

The protocol has been audited twice. Audits can be found here: https://docs.mai.finance/risks/security

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

The protocol runs on decentralized systems such as competitive liquidations, and vote-based collateral onboarding. No single person has admin controls over the protocol. The treasury and some part of the protocol are secured by a multisig of doxxed team members.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

MAI has remained stable over the last 12 months, despite adverse market conditions. MAI has held Curve pools for several months, for most of which it has provided a considerable share of volume on Polygon and Fantom.

The pool in question on this proposal was created recently with the aim of launching QiDao on Ethereum.
 
6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) 

This will be the only intial incentivized liquidity on Ethereum for MAI.

921,"# Introduction

Liquidity gauge depositors can receive not only BAL, but also extra tokens (called 'reward tokens'). On Ethereum L1, this is relatively straightforward, and there's already a subDAO managing this. On child chains however (i.e. non-Ethereum L1 chains, such as Polygon or Arbitrum), this task is a bit more nuanced, as the gauge system allows for irrecoverable user error.

[`ChildChainGaugeTokenAdder`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/liquidity-mining/contracts/admin/ChildChainGaugeTokenAdder.sol) is a module that makes adding reward tokens to child chain gauges much safer, and should  be the only means by which this is done.

# Specification

The `ChildChainGaugeTokenAdder` contract (deployment addresses found [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220527-child-chain-gauge-token-adder)) must be granted permission to call `IChildChainStreamer.add_reward` and `IRewardsOnlyGauge.set_rewards` via the AuthorizerAdaptor. Then, the LM multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` must be granted permission to call `ChildChainGaugeTokenAdder.addTokenToGauge`.

## Execution details

This will be done in multiple networks: the named arguments below should be replaced with the actual constants specified later.

Call `grantRolesToMany` on the Authorizer, with:
 - `roles`: 
   - `add_reward_role`
   - `set_rewards_role`

# Risks

The LM multisig could misuse its permission and add incorrect or faulty tokens to the gauges. Since these have a limit of 8 tokens and they cannot be removed, such a situation would require a gauge migration.

Alternatively, the LM multisig could designate a distributor that sets overly long distribution durations (e.g. 5000 years), which would effectively make the distributions unusable.

No funds are at risk. The only funds potentially affected are those being distributed, which could be re-distributed over an over by a malicious distributor, dilluting the effective distributon rate.",bullish
922,"This temperature check will gauge delegates' interest/support for deploying the onboarding package to BSC.

I've attached the forum thread for the full context.

**TLDR**: The Uniswap Onboarding Package is for new deployments of Uniswap v3 to get set up with three-month liquidity incentives, a frontend (Oku), and incentives distribution tooling (Angle Merkl). These resources will help position Uniswap to have a formidable presence on new EVM chains.

**How the vote works**:
The temperature check will be considered met as long as the total number of votes cast for the funding options is over >10M. If there isn't a clear winner for which level of incentives the chain should receive, a discussion can be had before the onchain proposal.

* Angle Merkl charges 3% on incentives distributed with their system. They have offered a 25% discount on their base 3% fee for incentives distributed between $2.5m-$5m, a 50% discount on incentives distributed between $5m-$10m, and a 75% discount on all incentives above $10m in a 365-day period.",neutral
923,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

924,"Hello buddies,

I would like to know if you want prediction to be updated in a way that we could also bet on the price at the end of the week and at the end of the month in addition to the current gameplay.

by playing at the begining of the week or at the beginning of the month you get a better share of the reward pool than people that will join later.

for the weekly format it start monday and you can bet until friday(+5days). results are the next monday (+7days)

monthly format : start first day of the month and it end at the last day. you can't bet during one week before end of the month.


fees : 3% like normal prediction. 50% of the fees goes to burning. 50% of the fees goes to revenue sharing.",bullish

Add GHST as collateral on Aave Polygon market.

## Reference:
ARC Proposal: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-list-aavegotchi-ghst-token-as-collateral-on-matic-aave-network/3619/3
The DeFi Case for GHST Medium Post:  https://aavegotchi.medium.com/the-defi-case-for-ghst-256a8653346a

## Overview:
GHST is the eco-governance token of Aavegotchi, a fast-growing NFT game live on Polygon with NFTs backed by Aave aTokens, single-staking with 50-100% APY, multiple liquidity mining partnerships, and its own secondary market for NFT trading. 

GHST token has been live on Ethereum Mainnet since September 2020, when it was launched via a continuous bonding curve DAICO sale (still live today at aavegotchi.com/curve). 

The token was launched at 0.2 DAI / GHST and currently sits at around 2.10 DAI. The all-time high is around 2 DAI / GHST. GHST is priced in DAI because unlike most tokens in crypto, it is actually backed by a DAI reserve at a 33% connecting weight. This makes the price more stable because it takes more in/out to change the price. 

GHST was bridged to Polygon in January 2021, with more than 50% of its current total supply locked into the Polygon Bridge. It is well-distributed, with more than 17,000 holders and stakers on Ethereum and Polygon combined, and is very active, with more than 1.2 million transactions and an average volume of $50M on multiple top-tier CEXes and DEXes. 

## Use Cases within the AAVE Ecosystem
GHST has many use cases which make it an excellent choice for being listed as an Aave collateral:
* Staking in Aavegotchi Staking contracts, earning FRENS
* Providing liquidity on DEXes
* Participating in #BidToEarn Auctions, where getting outbid earns you GHST
* Staking as collateral within Aavegotchi NFTs
* Purchasing and trading Aavegotchi NFT assets 

GHST’s relatively low normalized volatility also makes it an excellent choice for a collateral for borrowing. 

## Risk Analysis:
**GHST Overall Risk is: B**

### Smart Contract Risk: B-
Maturity: 333 Days (Deployed on 9/14/2020)
Transactions: 1,274,683

### Counterparty Risk: B+

### Market Risk:  B

Market Cap: 130,000,000 
Average Volume:  $50,408,294
Normalized Volatility: 6%

**Overall Risk Score: B**

## Proposed Risk Parameters
Unlike most asset applications, we would like to propose two separate Risk Parameter options and allow the community to vote on their favorite. 

Option 1 is more conservative and in line with collaterals on the Aave Ethereum Market, while Option 2 is more liberal and similar to other collaterals on the Aave Polygon Market. 

Finally, we offer an option to only use GHST for borrowing, and an option to decline the listing completely. 

### Risk Parameters Option 1
LTV:  25%
Liquidation Threshold: 45%
Liquidation Bonus: 12.5%*
Reserve Factor: 20%

### Risk Parameters Option 2
LTV:  50%
Liquidation Threshold: 65%
Liquidation Bonus: 12.5%*
Reserve Factor: 20%

*In their recent report, Gauntlet suggested using max 12.5% LB

### Summary

DAOhaus proposes to add a veBAL guage for the [HAUS/WETH 80/20 pool] `https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x17ddd9646a69c9445cd8a9f921d4cd93bf50d108000200000000000000000159)`

### Protocol Description

[$HAUS]`https://daohaus.club/token` is the governance token for DAOhaus.

DAOhaus is a home for purpose-driven community DAOs. The DAOhaus platform is a human-friendly interface for communities to collectively deploy and manage [Moloch DAOs] `https:// medium.com/raid-guild/moloch-evolved-v2-primer-25c9cdeab455` Over 2,000 DAOs have been summoned on the DAOhaus platform to date, with over 10,000 individual DAO members and millions of dollars worth of crypto assets secured in DAO treasuries.

#### Governance: UberHaus and Warcamp

DAOhaus is governed by [UberHaus]`https://uberhaus.club/`, a DAO whose members are themselves DAOs that use the DAOhaus platform. UberHaus’ powers include governing the non-circulating $HAUS supply.

Uberhaus delegates (appointed by each DAO according to their own processes) meet weekly to discuss Uberhaus business. Proposals are made with a 4 day voting period and a 14 day ""grace period"" during which member DAOs can exercise their right to  ""ragequit"", i.e., exit the DAO with their full share of the treasury. This credible threat of exit creates a robust balance of power within the DAO and incentivizes seeking consensus whenever possible.

UberHaus funds one of its member DAOs – Warcamp – to build, maintain, and promote the DAOhaus platform. All core contributors to DAOhaus are members of, and receive compensation from, the Warcamp DAO. Warcamp members are admins of the DAOhaus Github repos.

##### Relevant links:

* The [UberHaus DAO]`https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0x4bec8e49aa44bb520bd5e29d6358e22464b5eb68` (on Gnosis Chain), which includes the main treasury and non-circulating $HAUS supply
* The [Warcamp DAO]`https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xef3d8c4fbb1860fceab16595db7e650cd5ad51c1` (on Gnosis Chain)
* The [UberHaus delegate multisig]`https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x648DfEBbaf3638cDa047141dbF4AF3006e880f49` (on Ethereum; 6 of 11), via which a set of delegates from UberHaus and Warcamp manage UberHaus’ assets on Ethereum. Those assets include a portion of the HAUS/WETH Balancer pool liquidity.

#### $HAUS Price History

The majority of the $HAUS price history is viewable [on Coingecko]`https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/daohaus`.

March 29, 2021, was the first time there was publicly available $HAUS liquidity. The initial price at that point was $8.88. There was an immediate runup just prior to Coingecko beginning to track the price.
___
### Motivation

The [HAUS/WETH 80/20 pool]`https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x17ddd9646a69c9445cd8a9f921d4cd93bf50d108000200000000000000000159` needs incentivization to help maintain and deepen its liquidity, which would have a number of important benefits, including the following.

* Enabling easier access to $HAUS for DAOs and individuals wishing to participate in DAOhaus governance activities
* Facilitating DAOhaus ecosystem grants denominated in $HAUS (by increasing the relative stability of the $HAUS price)
* Facilitating upcoming utilization of $HAUS as a coordination mechanism (beyond voting) within the DAOhaus ecosystem (also related to price stability)
* Supporting the utility and value of DAOhaus contributor compensation denominated in $HAUS
____
### Specifications

#### Governance:

See Governance section under Protocol Description above.

#### Oracles:

The DAOhaus platform does not rely on any external oracles.

#### Audits:

The most used smart contracts in the DAOhaus platform are instances of the [MolochV2.1 contract framework]`https://github.com/HausDAO/Molochv2.1`. V2.1 makes only a small adjustment to the [V2 contract]`https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch`, which was audited by Consenys Diligence.

None of the contracts used within the DAOhaus platform are upgradable.

DAOhaus also makes use of Minion contracts, which allow a DAO to interact with external contracts and control external vaults. The predominant version is the [Safe Minion contract]`https://github.com/HausDAO/MinionSummonerV2`, which acts as middleware between the DAO contract and a Gnosis Safe, where all the funds are stored and external contract interactions are executed.

There have been no hacks of DAOhaus smart contracts to date.

* [MolochV2 audit report]`https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/01/the-lao/` by Consensys Diligence

#### Centralization vectors:

DAOhaus takes decentralization seriously and has made several organizational design choices to avoid concentrating power. As a result, the current state of DAOhaus is reasonably decentralized:

* None of the DAOhaus contracts are upgradable.
* Governance power over key on-chain assets is distributed across multiple entities, each of which is a DAO of its own. For example, DAOhaus core contributors (Warcamp) is a 30-person DAO with distributed governance powers.
* Non-circulating $HAUS is controlled by UberHaus, the DAO of DAOs. No DAO in UberHaus controls more than 10.5% of voting shares, and there is no path by which a DAO could gain additional voting shares without permission from a majority of peer DAOs.

The largest centralization vector is our front end hosting, over which a handful of developers have admin control. However, while an attack on the front end could manipulate what users see, the on-chain contracts (readable and writable via block explorers) remain the source of truth for all key user assets.

Our goal is to migrate our entire stack to decentralized infrastructure.

#### Market History:

The pool has been active since March 8, 2022.

* Current TVL: $2.1M
* Historical volume: $248k

## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. In addition, we propose freezing the KNCL reserve.


## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.


## Specification

The recent market downturn on the weekend of December 4th led to the most liquidations on both centralized exchanges and in liquidity protocols in the recent past. Most liquidations on the Aave protocol happened between 4:30 and 5:45 UTC when the price of ETH dropped nearly 13%. Below is a graph of liquidation by collateral and repay asset.
![Liquidations by collateral and repay asset](https://i.imgur.com/gDTtU13.png)
Although volatility for assets is slightly higher, the abundance of liquidity and active market participants is a positive sign for the health of Aave! For example, the total value of CRV (curve dao token) liquidated was large compared to the total collateral used on Aave. Lower LTV, lower liquidation threshold, and higher liquidation bonus protect the protocol from insolvencies. However, multiple liquidations of over 400,000 USD occured in quick succession. This shows ample liquidity for liquidators even in times of high network congestion. These market events provide important data points for measuring tail risk.

For reference, previous analysis of liquidations on Aave from May 2021 can be found here: https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/aave-protocol-liquidation-retrospective-may-2021-67c655fc1b31

Although some assets currently have higher volatility, our analysis shows that it is safe to increase borrowing parameters and decrease liquidation bonus values. Our simulations study price drops and network congestion more extreme than was seen last week, and slippage and liquidity considerations have improved.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAT Loan To Value     | 70%     | 75%     |
| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |
| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |
| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 60%     |
| REN Liquidation Threshold     | 60%     | 65%     |
| SNX Loan To Value    | 30%     | 40%     |
| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 55%     | 60%     |
| SUSHI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |
| ZRX Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |

**Freezing KNCL**
The KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://www.notion.so/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://www.notion.so/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.

Considering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.

933,"## TLDR;
graviAURA tokens inside of a Balancer gauge will not overvote for the guage they are in if the gauge has 10% or more of the total vote weight. The graviAURA vote weight will instead vote for core pools based on the bribe distribution with 90% of its vote weight and the usual 10% vote weight fee will be taken by BadgerDAO.

## Outcome:
The above fix will align the interests of BadgerDAO, BalancerDAO, naked graviAURA depositors and graviAURA LPs in gauges. This will also allow for large veBAL holders to still overvote for graviAURA pools but with diminishing returns.

Using the excess vote weight to vote for bribes will align with Balancer core pools and drive emissions to pools earning the highest fees. This is ideal compared to voting for specific pools as it allows graviAURA to better follow natural market forces and not overvote for pools in an ever changing landscape.

A 3 month time limit will ensure that any interested parties can take the time to bring more complete governance to the table as more data becomes available.

938,"I have a wonderful idea to evolve and improve PancakeSwap. My Idea is called PancakeSwap Casino, which is a video game where you can earn cake by betting and playing Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, Slot Machines, etc. I will now briefly explain how it would work hypothetically.

Each PancakeSwap holder of cake will be able to play PancakeSwap Casino via mobile android, PC and VR through Occulus. Consoles like PS5, PSVR2 and Xbox could come later. The holder of cake installs the game, they login into the game via QR, or their Crypto wallet credentials. They enter the casino in first person view. Touch controls for mobile, mouse and keyboard for PC and hand gestures for VR.

They will be able to move around the casino and go to certain areas to play Blackjack, Poker, Roulette and Slot Machines.

Blackjack: The player approaches the dealer in the correct area where blackjack tables are held. Once playing blackjack, the player will need to bet a certain amount of CAKE. Minimum CAKE requirement 1 CAKE. The player will be able to Bet, Hit, Stay or double during the game. So the player receives their first two cards. There choices will be to Hit, receive another card. Stay, not receive anymore cards, or double up, where a player can double up their bet midway, receive another card and then its the dealers turn, same process. If the dealer wins, the player loses the original bet plus the double if they have doubled their bet mid way. If they win, the player receives double the amount of CAKE from their original bet. It should be noted that every time the player loses a bet, 20% of the CAKE will be burned, 80% will go back to PancakeSwap. If Player wins, they recieve 80% of the winings and 20% is burned.

Poker: This one will have two versions, one the player can play with an AI Dealer, and the other with fellow PancakeSwap players. When Playing with the dealer, The player will make their bet, they will receive 5 cards, the dealer will recieve 5 cards, if playing against fellow pancakeswap players, the participant all receive 5 cards. Each Player and AI will have the option in the next process to put down 1-5 cards, then request for a new set of cards 1-5. Who ever has the highest hand wins the CAKE pot. For Player Vs AI,  if the player loses, 20% of the CAKE will be burned, 80% will go back to PancakeSwap. For Players Vs Players, 10% of the pot will be burned, 15% goes to pancakeswap and 75% goes to winner of game.

Roulette: The Player approaches the area, the player approaches a dealer and begins to play. The Player sets the amount of cake they want to bet. They place their cake chips on what ever number 0-36, red or black, odd or even, 1st 12, 2nd 12, 3rd 12, 1-18, 19-36 or 2to1. If the player wins, they recieve 80% of the winings and 20% of the pot is burned. If the dealer wins, 20% is burned 80% goes to Pancakeswap.

Slot Machines - The players approaches the slot machine area, they interact with slot machine, they insert the number of CAKE they wish to play with. They pull the lever and try to get a set of 4 of same kind. The highest prize will be 4 cake heads. Of course there will be other icons the player will be able to match to recieve smaller prizes of cake. If the player loses. 20% is burned, 80% goes back to pancakeswap.

The above is a rough idea how PancakeSwap Casino could work. A VR version would involve interactive hand gestures to make bets, signal for a card, etc.

All im asking is $65,000 USD worth of Cake for 1 year worth of my personal labour to develop and create PancakeSwap Casino. A further $150,000 USD worth of Cake for any resources, software, etc needed to help the development of PancakeSwap Casino. Hope the Community and PancakeSwap itself are willing to help crowd fund this project. More details below! I also have attached some video links of my work at the bottom of the page.

939,"#### ABSTRACT

To produce 12 independent animations with a run time of 1 minute each.

This proposal introduces an ecosystem-wide casting call to all eligible IP Holders powered by ApeCoin. The animators of Atrium have experience with Disney, Pixar, HBO, Netflix & more and await the opportunity to co-create with community members. Funding this proposal showcases ApeCoin’s dedication to providing new avenues for creators and results in 12 animations under a “Legend of ApeCoin” theme.

Rationale of Value Added to ApeCoin

- In an increasingly digital landscape, content rules permanence and brand recall. Good brands build timeless content that fans can anchor on. That in turn creates an increasingly valuable ecosystem around it. As the canon storylines are created officially by Yuga, this proposal to the ApeCoin DAO community has a unique opportunity to co-create equally memorable characters and storylines that are completely driven bottoms-up.
- Being crypto native and having highly experienced talent from the animation industry (Pixar, Sony, Netflix, Dreamworks, Marvel), Atrium is uniquely positioned to work with ApeCoin DAO to create content that appeals to mainstream audience, bring more awareness to an already lovable crypto-native brand and deliver co-created cinematic content.

How does this benefit DAO + DAO members?

- ApeCoin DAO produces the storylines the community creates involving the ApeCoin brand.

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Add to rETH Holding
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & @DefiJesus + ACI - @MarcZeller 
created: 2023-10-14

---

# Summary

This publication proposes acquiring rETH with ETH held in the DAO's Ethereum Treasury.

# Abstract

This publication proposes converting a portion of the wETH, awETH and wEthWETH held in the Treasury to rETH.

A balance of 100 aEthWETH will remain in the Treasury to facilitate on going DAO expenses such as the [Quarterly Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680) and any other future expense that arise.

# Motivation

At the time of writing the Aave DAO has the following assets in the Ethereum Treasury:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 14.56 |22,543.32|
|awETH|530.39|820,829.60|
|aEthWETH|510.45 | 789,962.05|

The following assets are available to be claimed from the Paraswap Legacy Fees and Fee Claimer contract:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 4.53 |7,011.99|
|wETH| 10.8 |16,717.32|

This publication proposes converting all wETH, awETH and all but 100 aEthWETH to rETH. The 100 aEthWETH is to remain to support on going DAO funding. 

The table below shows the yield differential between the various assets:

|Asset|Yield (%)| 
| --- | --- | 
|wETH| 0.00|
|awETH|1.26|
|aEthWETH|1.97 |
|rETH|3.07|

Based upon current market conditions, the additional yield generated by converting the assets as outlined to rETH is $23,266.50. 

Upon implementation of this [ARFC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-aave-v3-eth-pool-weth-parameters/15110), the additional yield generated is ~$654.42, for the conservative and ~$2,782.86, for the aggressive approach due to the reduction in deposit rates of approximately 10.3 bps and 33.5bps respectively. This does not take into consideration how the market will then adjust after the ETH v3 interst rate parameters are changed. 

# Specification

The following is to be performed:

* Deposit all wETH into aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH)
* Withdraw all awETH (Aave V2 wETH) into ETH
* Withdraw all but 100 aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH) into ETH
* Deposit ETH into RocketPool's rETH
* Transfer rETH into collector

I am a supporter of Cake emission reduction to fight inflation. For some months we have been reducing only the emissions of the Farms and not those of the Syrup Pools.

I'm against cutting only farms emission while keeping syrup pools emission at the same level. Farms constitute crucial part of PCS and each time they reduce Cake emission er are making them less attractive to the market.

To make the ecosystem more sustainable, I propose to the community to vote on the reduction of cake emission for the Cake Pool (stake cake earn cake), which is the Pool that increases Cake's inflation the most.

Title: [ARFC] Orbit Program Renewal May 2024 
Date: 2024-05-13
Author: Marc Zeller - Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)
---

## Summary

Proposing the renewal of the Orbit program for recognized delegates, compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement of Gas costs associated with their governance activity.

## Motivation

Orbit recognizes the added value of the Delegates in the decentralization & diversity of the Aave DAO. This compensation allows them to focus on aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance. The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter.

With the transition to Governance V3, a significant feature introduced is gasless voting via Gelato integration on the [DAO-run governance app](https://vote.onaave.com), making it easier for delegates to participate without the burden of gas costs. This innovation prompts the proposal to discontinue the general gas rebate program. However, recognizing the continued necessity for proposal creation and payload deployment activities, we propose maintaining targeted gas rebates for these specific actions.

## Specification

* **Period Coverage:** Blocks 19162697 (5th Feb 2024) to Block 19860031 (May 13th 2024)
* **Eligible Platforms:**
	+ EzR3al
	+ Stable Labs
	+ Saucy Block
	+ Areta
* **Gas Rebate:** Since this period is entirely covered by Governance V3, the Orbit program does not reimburse delegate vote gas as their vote is now subsidized by Gelato. We will continue to reimburse Service Providers for their Governance-related activity:

   + ACI : 2.74 ETH
   + TokenLogic : 0.641 ETH

* **Budget:** 60000 GHO and 3.381 ETH
* **Relevant Links:**

+ [ACI's Orbit tracker](https://apps.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker)


## Next Steps
1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is achieved, move this proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.
3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage for implementation and funding allocation in cooperation with Aave Finance service providers via an ad-hoc AIP vote or bundled in one of their treasury management AIPs.

> This pool uses the new weighted pool factory which allows us to apply the protocol fee to yield bearing tokens. bb-rf-aUSD is `Beets Reaper Aave Boosted USDC/USDT/DAI`, which means we're using a linear pool to deposit stables into Reaper Vaults which only deposit into Aave. Reaper handles the autocompounding of any OP rewards which adds additional yield. For reference, Reaper is a fork of Yearn v2 run by the Byte Masons who are talented developers in their own right. BeethovenX has a close working relationship with the Byte Masons. In the absence of an Aave v3 compatible atoken wrapper this arrangement represents the best path forward, and arguably it's better than using a wrapper since we get the additional compounding benefit. The kind of vault we're using has held 9 figures of TVL and been thoroughly battle tested so it should add a negligible risk premium.

> bb-rf-aUSD represents boosted USDC, USDT, and DAI. rETH is Rocket Pool's liquid staked ETH. rf-grain-OP represents Reaper Granary Boosted OP, meaning OP is deposited into a [granary.finance](https://granary.finance/) lending pool. Aave does not support OP as an asset and Granary is an Aave 2 fork also run by the Byte Masons so it was decided to use Granary to provide extra yield on OP.

**Protocol Description:**

>  USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO. USDT is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Tether. rETH is liquid staked ETH by Rocket Pool. OP is the governance token of the Optimism network.

**Motivation:**

> The goal of this pool is to generate additional trading activity around rETH while also building deeper liquidity in other yield bearing tokens. We're currently working with aggregators to support pools like this so for now the trading volume is likely to remain low and entirely driven by arbitrage bots. I view this pool and similar pools as critical to Balancer's strategy around staked ETH - we need to be leaders in pushing staked ETH liquidity outside of weth pairs. 

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Find more information about governance on Rocket Pool's [forum](https://dao.rocketpool.net/c/governance/8).

6. **Value:** We will earn the protocol fee on rETH, bb-rf-aUSD, and rf-grain-OP yield, plus trading fees. As a reminder, protocol fees on Optimism are split 50% to Balancer (passively to DAO & veBAL) and 50% to BeethovenX. Of BeethovenX's 50%, half is returned as incentives on Optimism pools either via bribes or direct LM. The other half is split between funding the team and accumulating veBAL/auraBAL/vlAURA per this [recent proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x3d6e0373f0f1c041a82e6108a01aee2e00a21be43667259126b70e5fd2a5f93a).

953,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-staking-of-bpt-for-economic-and-governance-benefits/2113/36).

## Summary

LongHash Ventures proposes a program for BAL/WETH LP token (“BPT” throughout this proposal) holders to stake their BPT for different periods of time in order to get economic benefits, such as boosting their Liquidity Mining rewards, and governance benefits, such as having the ability to vote on proposals. This staking feature is beneficial for the Balancer protocol as it rewards BAL holders who take a long-term view through staking of their BPT, while still ensuring BAL is not sitting idly staked but within a BAL pool.

For the purpose of focusing on the staking and governance mechanisms, this document will only propose staking of BPT from the BAL/WETH pool. In the future, proposals can be made to include BPTs from other BAL pools. Additionally, this proposal will only propose staking on L1. Staking on L2s such as Polygon should be addressed in a separate proposal.

## Background

LongHash Ventures is a Web 3 investment fund and accelerator actively collaborating with founders to navigate the crypto landscape in Asia and build their Web 3 model. In January 2021, we launched a DeFi-focused fund and invested in projects such as Balancer. We also invited Balancer to join our Asia DeFi Network initiative, as part of which we worked together with Balancer Labs over the course of 12 weeks through our venture building program to support them with the development of a decentralized governance model, liquidity mining for Balancer V2, and community building in China. We wrote this proposal as a follow on to the work we did on governance as a natural first step and enabler towards a decentralized governance model.

Governance token staking has been adopted by DeFi protocols, such as Uniswap and Curve. It is a way to provide an incentive mechanism for token holders to actively participate in the governance of the protocol. It is also beneficial for the protocol as it rewards BAL holders that take a long-term view, and incentivizes them to actively participate in the governance and future development of the protocol.

As the governance of Balancer begins to shift from Balancer Labs to a more decentralized model that is led by the community, staking of BPT from the BAL/WETH pool can act as a mechanism to incentivize token holders to actively participate in the governance of the protocol.

We have taken inspiration from the staking model of Curve, Idle Finance, and Pickle Finance for this proposal.

## Proposal

We propose a staking program and mechanism for the BPT of the BAL/WETH pool to have economic and governance benefits, as part of a broader effort to formalize the decentralized governance framework that will govern the Balancer protocol.

## Economic benefits of staking BPT

### Boosting of BAL rewards for Liquidity Mining

In Balancer V2, Liquidity Providers can earn BAL tokens from the liquidity provided into specific pools eligible, based on their proportional share of liquidity of those pools.

Liquidity Providers could stake BPT from the BAL/WETH pool to boost their Liquidity Mining rewards, based on the period of time the tokens are staked for. For example, Liquidity Mining rewards could be boosted by X (multiplier) if BPT tokens are staked for Y (time period). Note that this staking mechanism does not change or impact the amount of weekly BAL allocated to the pool, but rather changes the proportion of the allocation of those BAL rewards to the LPs depending on their share of the pool and whether they have staked their BPT and the duration of staking.

## Governance benefits of staking BPT

### Voting on proposals

As Balancer embarks on a journey towards decentralization of how the protocol is run, a key enabler of this will be for the ability of BPT holders to vote on proposals. Staking of BPT would allow addresses that staked to vote on Balancer protocol governance proposals as long as the BPT remains staked/locked.

## Features of BPT staking

BPT token holders would have the option to stake their BPT into a smart contract and lock it in for a period of between 1 month and up to 4 years, in monthly increments, e.g. 1 month, 2 months, …, and 48 months. The UI/UX would be intuitive for less experienced users, for example with a “slider” feature with monthly increments, from 1 month to 48 months, that can also show the LP what the rewards booster is for each lock up period.

In return, BPT token holders who stake their BPT receive vBPT, a token that enables them to claim economic and governance benefits outlined above. Those who stake BPT would receive vBPT on a 1:1 basis regardless of the locking period. The boost to liquidity mining rewards depending on the locking period is outlined in the table below: SEE FORUM POST

Note that BPT holders who stake their BPT will not be able to withdraw BAL from the BAL/WETH pool for the staking period of BPT, e.g. if a BPT holder stakes BPT for 12 months, they will not be able to withdraw BAL or WETH from the BAL/WETH pool for 12 months.

The formula for rewards boosting would work, conceptually, as follows:

[LP’s share of pool] x [Multiplier] / [Sumproduct of LP’s share of pool and multiplier] = [Share of BAL rewards]

## Conclusion

This proposal for a staking mechanism to give economic and governance benefits to BAL holders can be a benefit for Balancer on two fronts:

-It provides a rewards mechanism for BAL holders who take the long-term view
-It is a starting point for Balancer to shift to a decentralized governance model

We think it is best to start with the features outlined above for the staking mechanism. In the future, additional features or modifications / scope can be proposed and added to it, such as:

-Staking BPT from BAL pools other than BAL/WETH
-Distribution of protocol fees to vBPT holders
-Vote boosting feature to provide additional voting power to BPT holders who stake for longer periods of time
-Staking mechanism for L2s",bearish
954,"#### Proposal to Reduce CAKE Token Total Supply

Over the past year, PancakeSwap has significantly revamped its tokenomics, emissions, and growth strategy. Starting from improving [**CAKE Tokenomics v2.5**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x707643dd2c2b941c7274f26a0362922198912e8549050ae9f2d1d9d71ada04bb) to most recently launching the [**veCAKE Gauges System**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), CAKE is in a position to pursue further growth across all deployments.

Now that CAKE has achieved consistent deflation for several months and is focusing on accelerating our journey to ultrasound CAKE, this proposal aims to reduce the CAKE token’s total supply to a **maximum cap of 450M CAKE**. 

With a current **total supply of 388M CAKE**, the Kitchen believes this new and lower cap will be sufficient to gain market share across all chains and sustain the veCAKE model.

![](https://imgur.com/kGk5kri.png)


#### Proposal Rationale:
There are several strong reasons to implement this adjustment:
- **Certainty for the community on future CAKE token supply**: 

When PancakeSwap launched in 2021, to ensure that there were sufficient incentives to bootstrap the ecosystem, there was significant token inflation. After almost 3 years in development, we now have more accurate estimations of incentives required to achieve our growth targets.

- **Accelerate the journey to ultrasound CAKE**: 

Total supply is an important metric when understanding the impact of token burns and future emissions. Lowering this number is a critical step to achieve ultrasound CAKE and enables us to send a clear signal of PancakeSwap’s pivot away from a hyperinflationary tokenomics model.

- **Ensure sufficient flexibility for growth**: 

450M CAKE is a reasonable new cap as it  ensures sufficient supply for future growth (e.g., gaining market share on Ethereum, Ethereum L2s, and new initiatives like position managers)


#### Adjustment Details:
With the above in mind, we propose the following adjustments to CAKE total supply:
- **Current Total Supply:** 750,000,000 CAKE
- **Future Total Supply:** 450,000,000 CAKE
- **CAKE Total Supply Decrease:** -300,000,000 CAKE
- **Implementation steps:** Decrease the max cap on token supply accordingly


Before you vote, please make sure you understand the impact of long and short term effects of CAKE emissions changes on our tokenomics.

955,"**Summary:**
FIAT DAO is seeking the preliminary approval of veBAL gauges for two yet-to-be-deployed stableswap pools.

- **FIAT-USDC-DAI**
- **FIAT-FEI-FRAX**

This comes after the successful migration of our governance token $FDT’s liquidity to the Balancer platform over the past month.

**References/Useful links:**

- **[App](https://app.fiatdao.com)**
- **[Docs](https://docs.fiatdao.com)**
- **[Dune](https://dune.com/1ab/FIAT)**
- **[Github](https://github.com/fiatdao)**
- **[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/fiatdao)**

**Protocol Description:**
The FIAT protocol is a DeFi-native repo market solution for providing liquidity to holders of fixed income assets. It allows users of apps like Element Finance, Notional Finance, and Yield Protocol to bring their proofs of liquidity to the protocol in order to collateralize a debt position in $FIAT, a stable value asset. Our v1 has just launched, and it’ll look and feel familiar for users who have previously minted DAI, RAI, or MIM. By utilizing proven stablecoin mechanisms, the protocol is able to offer competitive borrowing power to holders of such collateral assets, allowing them to releverage fixed yields or meet current liabilities as the locked assets mature. You can learn more about its primary use case via [this thread](https://twitter.com/wjvill/status/1527680960866705408) from Element founder Will Villanueva.

**The success of FIAT is predicated on its ability to attract secondary liquidity.** In its current iteration, it is pooling secondary liquidity around a singular asset, drawing forward demand for an otherwise fragmented universe of collateral backing. Unique to FIAT versus other CDP implementations is that fixed term collateral forces users to repay back their debt at a known point in time, lest they bear negative yields due to FIAT interest accrual on those positions thereafter - this allows for higher maximum LTVs and potentially more trading fees for LPs. Currently, only stablecoin-denominated collateral is supported by the protocol, so any risk premium is a function of smart contract concerns or changes in prevailing yields.

**Motivation:**
Over the course of its first month in existence, $FIAT has had its liquidity subsidized on Curve via a discretionary budget. Over the same time, liquidity for our governance token has been ported to Balancer. We’ve been very pleased with the migration and think it makes sense to follow suit with $FIAT here in its early days.

A number of items excite us about the opportunity:

- The presence of boosted staBAL and now FEI-FRAX-DAI pools will allow for user pathways that involve depositing into either, minting FIAT, and selling FIAT for more of the underlying in order to gain levered fixed exposure. **This results in locked TVL for Balancer and higher trading fees for Balancer LPs.**

- With Hidden Hand, it will become possible to have a larger consortium of projects actively subsidize FIAT LPs. We anticipate that all of our collateral partners with associated ERC-20 tokens will see the value in deeper FIAT liquidity for their protocols. And for other stableswap pools that exist on Balancer, deeper FIAT liquidity increases the odds of locked TVL in their pools.

- The user experience associated with veBAL and Hidden Hand is more clear than our current Curve → Rari Fuse flow.

**What we would like to discuss in this thread, however, is the deployment of the stableswap pools themselves.** Given the nature of FIAT (i.e. CDP architecture, stablecoin backing, audited collateral issuers), we would be interested to hear what members of the Balancer DAO have to say regarding their comfort with varying levels of potential [A coefficients](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/math/stable-math). If you have any specific thoughts regarding this topic, please share your opinion in the thread!

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** FIAT DAO is a completely on-chain organization, with no corresponding real world entity in place. The FDT token has been given away for free since November of 2021, and a DAO smart contract architecture has been live since December 2021.

2. **Oracles:** $FDT is a standard ERC-20 DeFi governance token that comes with the volatility inherent to the sector. $FIAT is a DAI-like asset that will come to be backed by less liquid derivatives, but at the moment only supports collateral types with existing secondary markets.

3. **Audits:** Audits of our protocol and our collateral oracle system can be found in the [Security](https://github.com/fiatdao/security) repo within our Github.

4. **Centralization Vectors:** $FDT holders determine which assets are supported as collateral and the parameters associated with each. A six of eleven guardian multisig currently holds certain emergency privileges.

5. **Market History:** $FIAT has been transferable since April 2022. It previously reached a high watermark of $1.3M deposited on Curve.

We would like to take this to a vote now that the FUD pool is live.

957,"Proposal to add support for stMATIC on Aave V3 Polygon market

Overview

This is a proposal to add stMATIC to the Polygon v3 market.

Aave governance recently added stETH to the Ethereum v2 market with great success, having a market size of $1.43 billion. The stMATIC token is similar but differs in one important aspect. Instead of being a rebasing token like stETH, it simply becomes more expensive over time relative to MATIC as it accrues yield.

Since Aave governance enjoyed stETH, I would venture to guess they will like stMATIC as well.

In addition, this will unlock leveraged MATIC yield positions similar to the ETHMAXY token by the Galleon DAO (https://blog.galleon.community/the-eth-max-yield-index-is-live-on-ethereum-df6dc9bbc5b4?gi=970b8b8e4f52).

Background

PoLido is a DAO governed liquid staking protocol for the Polygon PoS chain. It allows users to stake their MATIC tokens on the Ethereum mainnet and immediately get the representation of their share in the form of stMATIC token without maintaining staking infrastructure. Users will get staking rewards and still control and utilize their stMATIC tokens in secondary markets on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon.

MATIC tokens will be delegated across validators that are registered and accepted by the DAO inside PoLido protocol.

Node operators don’t have direct access to the delegated assets. They are just providing infrastructure and getting rewards in return. Assets are controlled by PoLido core smart contracts exclusively.

The goal is to help with Polygon decentralization and integrate stMATIC with the variety of protocols and DeFi applications on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon PoS chain.

In short, Lido for Polygon is enabling users to:

Stake their MATIC tokens in a decentralized and secure way
Use their stMATIC on the secondary market
Do all of the above simply and easily with a click of a button on the UI
Additional value PoLido can bring to the Polygon ecosystem is decentralizing stake distribution, and getting more capital efficiency in the ecosystem — enabling staked MATIC to participate in DeFi on Polygon.

stMATIC token
Polygonscan Link:
https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3a58a54c066fdc0f2d55fc9c89f0415c92ebf3c4

stMATIC is an ERC20 token that represents the account’s share of the total suuply of MATIC tokens inside PoLido system. It is a non-rebasable token, which means that the amount of tokens in the user’s wallet is not going to change. During time, the value of this token is changing, since the amount of MATIC tokens inside the protocol is not constant.

Paramenters
Using the relative parameter adjustments between ETH and stETH, I propose the following for stMATIC. These will be subject to change with more discussion. 

Max LTV: 55%
Liquidation threshold: 62%
Liquidation penalty: 15%

958,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

Firstly, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to the Trading Allocation (and therefore farms) – the per block allocation to the Trading Allocation will remain at [**1.93 CAKE/block**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics).

Importantly, the purpose of this proposal is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. 

By boosting APRs for higher-performing farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below. Rewards will be redistributed from farms with reduced multipliers to farms with increased multipliers, along with all other existing farms. This will give us increased capacity to establish Syrup Pool/Farm arrangements with more partner projects.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their farm multiplier, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, etc.

960,"**Payload PR:** https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/57

## Background
The [v3 Weighted Pool Factory](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20230206-weighted-pool-v3) and the [v3 Composable Stable Pool Factory](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks//20230206-composable-stable-pool-v3) where deployed to fix reentrancy issue described [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345).  Some initial ""wire-up"" of permissions is required to bring them into standard function.  This BIP lays out these changes and requests permission to apply them.

## English Specification
The authorisations to be ratified by this proposal would grant the same permissions to the [Balancer Mulitisigs](https://github.com/Tritium-VLK/multisig-ops) as the v2 factories as described by [BIP-62](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-62-stable-v2-composablestable-weighted-v2-permission-granting/3702).  

The specific permissions are best described by this map, which links function calls on the v3 pool and factory contracts to callers:
```json
{
    ""setSwapFeePercentage(uint256)"": ""feeManager"",
    ""startAmplificationParameterUpdate(uint256,uint256)"": ""feeManager"",
    ""stopAmplificationParameterUpdate()"": ""feeManager"",
    ""pause()"": ""emergency"",
    ""disable()"": ""emergency"",
    ""enableRecoveryMode()"": ""emergency"",
}
```
The ""emergency"" caller maps to the Balancer Emergency DAO Multisig as defined in [this vote](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197).

The feeManager caller group maps to the feeManager multisig controlled by the Balancer Maxis on all chains except mainnet.  On mainnet a special feeSetter multisig exists to manage a-factors and a gautletFeeSetter contract that allows bulk changing of fees.  The maxi's functionally control all contracts that make up the feeManager target group.

### Authorize the Emergency subDAO to pause the pools

Just like with previous pools, these new pools have an emergency pause period which is hardcoded at 3 months from the time the factories were deployed. During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. Funds can always be withdrawn by users, even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.

Since gathering 6/11 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also authorizing the [Emergency subDAO ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197) to pause pools. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Governance Multisig nor the Emergency subDAO will have any pause power. This authorization only applies to the composableStable and weighted v3 pool types.

### Authorize Balancer Maxis to manage pool parameters

Each pool’s smart contract contains a series of parameters that affect their efficiency and can be tuned depending on market conditions. The Balancer Maxis have been managing fees and the amplification factor for weighted and stable pools historically, and this would grant them the ability to do so for the new pool types below if this proposal is approved by the community. Any updates to a pool’s parameters will be announced in Discord beforehand.

* Stable Pools v3:
  * swap fee
  * amplification parameter
* composableStable:
  * swap fee
  * amplification parameter
* Weighted v3
  * swap fee

# Specification

The DAO multisig in each network will initiate transactions with the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling the function `grantRole` for each one of the following role/account tuples. 

For ease of review the below table has been sorted by chain and deployment, which should match the order found in the source of truth for actionIds on the [balancer-v2-monorepo](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids).

https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1076

**Summary:**
This proposal on behalf of the Maple Finance team is to enable a 2% gauge for a 50/50 syrupUSDC/sDAI pool on Ethereum. The pool is to support liquidity for the LP token from Maple’s newest product, Syrup. The pool will earn Syrup Drips.

**References/Useful links:**

    • Website → https://maple.finance/ and https://syrup.fi/
    • Documentation → https://syrup.gitbook.io/syrup
    • Github Page → https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core-v2

**Protocol Description:**

Syrup provides permissionless access to institutional yield sources via Maple Finance’s lending engine, which has facilitated more than 4 billion in loans to date. The yield is sourced from collateralized loans to crypto’s largest institutions, leveraging Maple’s smart contract infrastructure. syrupUSDC is the receipt LP token for lenders who deposit USDC into the Syrup smart contracts.

**Motivation:**

The underlying lending product for Syrup requires duration matching against the loan book issued against the provided lender capital. Liquidity in the worst case will take up to as long as the call period defined for each loan (which in some cases may be 30 days). Enabling a Balancer pool with sDAI can foster more immediate liquidity for the pool token, and deep liquidity will enable further integrations throughout DeFi as Syrup grows.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Maple Labs guides the direction of the protocol’s development, with MPL holders voting on certain governance decisions. The governor controls Maple Globals and has emergency access to pause certain functionality and is monitored by a multisig that includes Maple’s founders as well as core investors.   

2. **Oracles:** No, whilst the protocol has the ability to use chainlink oracles as collateral is held mainly at qualified custodians this feature of the protocol isn’t used. 

3. **Audits:** Audits from reputable firms including Trail of Bits, Spearbit, 0xMacro, and Three Sigma can be found in Maple and Syrup gitbooks (https://syrup.gitbook.io/syrup/technical-resources/security and https://maplefinance.gitbook.io/maple/technical-resources/security/security#audits). Syrup runs on Maple Finance’s smart contract infrastructure which has facilitated more than $4 billion of loans since inception.

4. **Centralization vectors:** The Governor and Operational Admin are the main administrators of the protocol, and is managed by a multisig. They control the administrative functions in the protocol, such as managing the MapleTreasury, defining global parameters and administrative functions to manage Loans for a given Pool. Additionally Pool Delegates are trusted actors. Pool Delegates have to go through a KYC process & due diligence to be onboarded to the Maple protocol by the Governor. They have a public reputation to protect, and are incentivized to act in the protocol's best interest to grow their pool's size. 

5. **Market History:** The asset has not observed volatility and will not be expected to outside of events of default from the underlying loan book. Maple’s smart contracts implement ERC 4626 so the value of one share of syrupUSDC will always be increasing in underlying asset value, provided there are outstanding loans. The Balancer pool itself will be seeded with liquidity next week following the broader launch of Syrup. 
 
6. **Value:** No; lenders can request withdrawal via the Syrup application which will be serviced as liquidity becomes available. The purpose of the Balancer pool will be to encourage more instant liquidity for users to get in and out of Syrup. However, provided liquidity becomes deep enough this could become a valid path as the primary source of liquidity for Syrup users looking to withdraw.

### [ARFC]  Onboard sUSDe to Aave V3 on Ethereum 

### Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

### Date: 2024-04-01

---

### **Summary**

This is an ARFC to seek approval for the addition of sUSDe to Aave V3 on Ethereum, following the consensus reached in the [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x3263dbee34f5afe513a1a6c5bcd5207684cee03473e1b3d7616993dbd87ab881) stage.

### **Motivation**

As discussed in the TEMP CHECK, Ethena's synthetic dollar, USDe, provides a stable crypto-native solution for a cash and carry structured product. The staked version of USDe, sUSDe, earns yield from the protocol and has high potential for strong borrow demand.

Paragraph Summary

Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets.

All art assets and Axie genetic data can be easily accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their own tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe.

While still in early access, Axie is ranked the #1 Ethereum game by daily, weekly, and monthly active users. It has generated over 13,000 ETH in revenue (16M+ USD) so far.

Motivation

Add $AXS as a lending currency into Aave money markets.

Specifications

What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
@Sutton (tw: ssSuttonSss) is an Axie Infinity guild manager and player at @AXGaming_sec .

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
**Axie Infinity Shards(AXS) are an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie Universe. **

Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
By listing $AXS you will be able to leverage an entire nation of gamers.

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
**
** Version 1 First half 2021 / Staking dashboard released
AXS holders can stake their tokens through the staking dashboard and participate in governance votes brought forward by the Sky Mavis team.

These votes will revolve around which teams should receive funding from the ecosystem fund, and how the Community treasury should be distributed.

Version 2 - Early 2022

More on-chain votes about smaller issues.

Potentially changing the way votes are being counted from 1 token 1 vote to Quadratic voting.

Version 3 - September 2023 / Decentralized Organization

AXS holders determine which governance framework should be used and how much should be voted on. Some decisions will not be up for debate such as token supply which is iron-clad in smart contracts.

Potential things that can be voted on:

Should Axie Infinity Limited continue to pay Sky Mavis to develop Axie Infinity?

Should Axie Infinity use the marketplace created by Sky Mavis?

How should the Community Treasury be used to reward AXS holders and the broader Axie community?

Should the Community Treasury funds be attached to any yield farming/staking services such as Yearn.finance or Rari.Capital?

How is the asset currently used?
*. In early 2021, the Community Treasury went live. The Community Treasury began to receive revenues generated by Axie Infinity as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury is by AXS stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. A more detailed overview of the Treasury can be found here 3.

The token has been designed in collaboration with Delphi Digital.
6. Emission schedule
AXS will be unlocked in a pre-determined schedule which lasts for 65 months from the public sale. The initial circulating supply is set to 59,985,000 AXS - 22.22% of the total supply.

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market 

Author: [@mv_Trident]

Created: 2023-12-18

---

# Summary

This AIP proposes the onboarding of the PYUSD stablecoin, minted by Paxos Trust Company, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.

# Motivation

PYUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin minted through Paxos. While it’s still young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $230M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:

- Build synergies between Aave and PYUSD.
- Offer Aave users an additional stablecoin option.
- Strengthen the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin. (Trident may explore the deployment of a PYUSD/GHO pool)

We propose a PYUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.

If the community deems that PYUSD as collateral is immediately viable we stand ready to support that role on day one; otherwise following PYUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for PYUSD at a later stage.

# Specification

Ticker: PYUSD
Contract address: [0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8])https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8)
Price Feed: [0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1)

Chainlink Oracle: [https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/PYUSD-usd](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/pyusd-usd)

We propose the following parameters for a PYUSD onboarding:

Parameter	Value
Isolation Mode	No
Borrowable	Yes
Collateral Enabled	No
Supply Cap (PYUSD)	25M
Borrow Cap (PYUSD)	20M
Debt Ceiling	N/A
LTV	N/A
LT	N/A
Liquidation Bonus	N/A
Liquidation Protocol Fee	10.00%
Variable Base	0.00%
Variable Slope1	7.00%
Variable Slope2	80.00%
Uoptimal	80.00%
Reserve Factor	10.00%
Stable Borrowing	Disabled
Stable Slope1	13.00%
Stable Slope2	300.00%
Base Stable Rate Offset	3.00%
Stable Rate Excess Offset	8.00%
Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio	20.00%
Flashloanable	No
Siloed Borrowing	No
Borrowed in Isolation	No

*Liquidity and Market Cap*

The PYUSD token was introduced a few months ago, and since its launch, its market cap has increased to approximately $230million. Over the coming weeks the pool will be scaled further with incentives in order to reach the necessary liquidity to support the proposed market parameters.

![PayPal USD Price Chart.png](ipfs://bafkreihqq36bcffddfsnmcz4m4gda4pcopqktjs4rdneanq4q4pggkesfm)
    
When analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at the available historical data. The 30 Day average Market Cap of PYUSD is $170M with a 30 day average volume of $4.7M. Over the last 7 days, the average Market cap has climbed to $209M with the same period seeing an average volume of $8.7M, the volume and aum increase is on the back of prior stakeholder efforts and we expect both to grow meaningfully in the coming weeks.

 
![coming weeks.png](ipfs://bafkreifqcajvizwsxvoiinqyppnncfzmdqk56dirdnwlfolhlwamonktva)
    

With peg holding well since inception, an average intra-day volatility of ~0.01%, and the ability of onboarded institutional investors to redeem PYUSD 1:1 with Paxos, we see low risk related to the stability of PYUSD’s price.

*Initial Supply and Borrow Caps*

PYUSD circulating supply is ~$230M. Given PYUSD is a new asset listing, we recommend adopting a conservative approach for setting supply and borrow caps for PYUSD, which gives room to expand caps should cap usage be elevated. We recommend a supply cap of 25M and a borrow cap of 20M.

*Variable Borrow Rate*

We recommend setting slope 1 to 7% due to current on-chain stable yield opportunities which we believe will remain viable for the foreseeable future.

*Borrowable in Isolation*

We do not see excess risk with enabling PYUSD being borrowable in isolation. If the community wishes to take a more conservative stance, it may wish to only limit PYUSD borrowing to non-isolated collateral.

# Next Steps:

1. Gather community feedback on this TEMP CHECK.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to TEMP CHECK snapshot stage.
3. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.
4. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
5. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage

**Protocol Description:**

>Gains Network [(gTrade)](https://gains.trade/trading#BTC-USD) is a decentralized perpetual futures trading platform with a robust infrastructure featuring 181 trading pairs with high leverage [up to 150x for crypto, 250x for commodities, and 1000x on forex], deep liquidity, guaranteed order execution, and accurate pricing. Since inception, the protocol has generated $73B lifetime volume.
The asset Gains Network would like to list on Balancer is gUSDC. gUSDC is one of the gVault tokens that receives a share of the protocol fees by serving as a counterparty to trader wins & losses.
The history price of gUSDC can be publicly viewed on our dune dashboard linked above. It has generally been an “up-only” asset with the exception of a few dips shortly after the launch of the asset back in January.
The historical price of gUSDC can be found here: https://dune.com/queries/3385617/5681244

**Motivation:**

> Gains Network aims to enable a gauge for a gUSDC / USDC pool to significantly increase the liquidity for gUSDC on secondary markets to set the foundation for more integrations with the purpose of expanding its utility across Arbitrum DeFi.

**Specifications:**
 
>Gains Network will utilize a part of its STIP.B LP incentives budget to bootstrap more (sticky) liquidity for the [gUSDC](https://gains.trade/vaults/gUSDC) vault as it anticipates more USDC-collateral usage on gTrade over the coming months. Initially, the focus will be on building liquidity on partner DEXs for gUSDC/USDC pools, including this Balancer pool. This strategy aims to unlock various partnership opportunities, creating an ecosystem around gUSDC through lending markets, LP-strategy protocols, and more.
Gains Network is seeking to co-incentivize this pool with Balancer to establish the required liquidity as a foundation for said gUSDC integrations and consecutively form a long-term partnership with Balancer as one of the main venues for gUSDC since Gains Network believes Balancer is a pool that can largely be maintained beyond incentives through swapping fees post the bootstrapping phase.

1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    

>The incentives distributor is governed by the following Multisig address: [0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D
](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D)And, Gains Network is actively working towards being a DAO governed through the $GNS token.

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

> gTrade leverages their own custom-built Chainlink decentralized oracle network (DON) to provide real-time, aggregated prices for their leveraged trading products. Their oracle architecture uses a custom DON to supply on-demand prices to an aggregator contract while the official Chainlink Price Feeds serve as anchors, meaning if their price differs by more than 1.5% from Chainlink Price Feeds, a circuit breaker is triggered.

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

> Audits are conducted with each upgrade Gains Network undergoes. With the release of [V8 in May](https://medium.com/gains-network/introducing-gtrade-v8-diamond-refactor-and-smart-contract-integration-a175b96ccb82), the entire codebase has been audited. Moreover, the release of [V9](https://x.com/GainsNetwork_io/status/1807877092836610406) [current version] has been audited as well.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

> We will state our centralization vectors by giving insights into our most centralized facet: the DON. The current custom decentralized oracle network is operated by 8 independent chainlink node operators & 1 price feed from StorkOracle.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

>There’s no information available on the Balancer pool yet as it’s yet to be launched. 
However, the gUSDC asset is tradeable on a Ramses CL pool as per June 15th and started to get incentivized with $ARB from June 27th onwards. The pool is currently sitting at $2M TVL and can be found here: https://ramses.exchange/liquidity/v2/0xe9e3ef12f1f9dbaf7b7f57ab262c54117448884b 
Since the inception of this secondary market pool, Gains Network vaults have been consistently overcollateralized while the gUSDC asset has never been below peg and has not experienced significant volatility. Considering the ‘up-only’ nature of gTokens and gUSDC currently sitting at a 124.1% collateralization ratio, the price of gUSDC is expected to continue its upwards price action as time passes. 

 
6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) 

>The pool will not serve as the primary source of liquidity in the bootstrapping phase, but will be leveraged as the primary source of liquidity once the bootstrapping phase has passed. 
The pool can generate consistent fees due to gUSDC depositors only being able to use Balancer as a means of exiting before our epoch system, looping through lending markets & liquidations through lending markets.

969,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-empower-balancerdao-to-add-approved-gauges-to-vebal-voting/3045)

## Introduction

The launch of veBAL has introduced the gauge voting system where veBAL lockers determine BAL emissions by voting for specific pool gauges. A flow has been created on the forum to facilitate approval of new gauges with several votes already passing in just the first three weeks. This proposal aims to streamline this process by delegating the power to add approved gauges to the voting list to the Balancer DAO.

*It is important to make clear that no gauge will be added by BalancerDAO without going through the forum process for approving a new gauge and successfully completing a snapshot vote in favor.*

## Motivation

To alleviate the workload from the DAO Multisig, I am proposing to delegate the power to add approved gauges to this gnosis safe: `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`. This safe already has the power to add new gauges for token rewards other than BAL so it makes sense to keep all gauge activities in the same place. Signers include myself, Mike B, Andrea, Xeonus, Zekraken, Luuk, and Markus who are some of the longest serving and most reliable members of Balancer DAO.

This group of signers will be responsible for ensuring that only approved gauges and gauges which have been correctly set up are added to the voting list. In practice this means the following:

* Ensuring that each forum proposal for a gauge gets adequate attention and that only pools with legitimate tokens are allowed to go for a vote (we don’t want to give BAL emissions to a pool with Uniswap LP tokens or an obvious scam token)
* For L2 gauges, checking that the root gauge has been correctly set up
  * Checking that the root gauge’s recipient getRecipient() is the address of the streamer contract on L2
  * Checking that the L2 gauge contract comes from the L2 factory (factory.isGaugeFromFactory(streamer))
  * Checking that the L2 gauge’s reward_contract is the streamer
  * Checking that the recipient reward_reciever() is a gauge with the LP token matching the pool from the approved vote

title: [ARFC] LDO Emission_Admin for Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism v3 Liquidity Pools
Author: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting
Dated: 2023-01-26

---

# Summary

This proposal is to enable Lido to distribute LDO rewards across the Aave v3 Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism Liquidity Pools. The `Emission_Admin` role for LDO on each network is to be assigned to a wallet controlled by the Lido DAO.

# Abstract

Lido seeks to distribute LDO rewards across to the various Aave v3 deployments. To achieve this, the `EmissionManager` function assigns an owner to the `Emission_Admin` role for LDO on each respective Aave v3 deployment, [1,2].

The wallet with `Emission Admin` permission for LDO on each aave v3 deployment then controls the distribution of only LDO rewards across the respective Liquidity Pool.

# Motivation

Enable Lido DAO to distribute LDO rewards across the Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism v3 Liquidity Pools.

The Lido Liquidity Mining Committee (LMC) determines the emission rate and duration at which LDO rewards are offered.

Typically, the LMC meets and determines the next 30 days of LDO rewards on a rolling basis. This means each month, the committee will determine if to extend the LDO rewards, or change the amount of LDO being offered across the various Aave v3 Liquidity Pools.

# Specification

The `EmissionManager`, a governance controlled function, assigns the `Emission_Admin` role for a specified token, LDO.

The `Emission_Admin` role controls the distribution of the specified token, LDO, across the specified Aave deployments.

The `Emission_Admin` can distribute LDO anywhere across the Aave v3 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.

# Implementation

Set `Emission_Admin` permission for LDO to the following Lido address:

|Network|LDO Address|Emission Admin|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Ethereum|0x5A98FcBEA516Cf06857215779Fd812CA3beF1B32|0x87D93d9B2C672bf9c9642d853a8682546a5012B5|
|Arbitrum|0x13Ad51ed4F1B7e9Dc168d8a00cB3f4dDD85EfA60|0x8C2b8595eA1b627427EFE4f29A64b145DF439d16|

Recently a[ proposal was passed](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xbd025f8f5a0b1d748a8ad034f5a2b6fd50cc8ff7257cbee6b8344b2a70e9e2ed) to add various candidates to our replacement signers list for the DAO Multisig. These replacements have been completed on Ethereum and remain ongoing on Polygon, Arbitrum, and Fantom. You can see the most up to date list of signers [here](https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/governance/multisig). In order to ensure the activities of the DAO Multisig can continue uninterrupted we should replenish our list of available replacements. Thus, I propose adding the following people to the approved list of replacements:

* Lewis, Stablecoin Labs / Gyroscope (0xbcf751dBfe314Ee96A660EFA2Fcb259CBc364c29)
* Mounir, Paraswap (0x0951ff0835302929d6c0162b3d2495a85e38ec3a)
* Anna, Cowswap (0x04ce1ccF81AE660e23ca0c0823911df709B0E7Fc)
* Kaito, Utopia Labs (0x01eacADF51FF60916157E32A58F640fe854e530F)
* Mr. Kind, BeethovenX (0xD876847533828bE6770D1dEdB6F8f5E91fed824e)
* Hubert, StakeDAO (0x28827186555d99d9eF9E1fdB97F65C93BA554F86)

As a reminder, the DAO Multisig can tap a replacement from the approved replacements list at their discretion whenever the need arises. Currently the only approved replacement candidate is:

* Evgeny Yurtaev, CEO at Zerion (0xcec0d1a31129af0b1088a3d8dfa6abb4bd1ecb45)

### Specification

If approved, the above listed candidates will be added to the approved replacement signer list and utilized if/when needed. Kain has signaled his desire to leave the DAO Multisig due to being too busy with his other activities and he will be replaced with Mounir from Paraswap immediately. Future changes will be announced via Balancer’s discord announcements channel and twitter.",bullish

# Proposal by Gyroscope

> ## Summary
> 
> * **This is a proposal to enable a 10% capped Balancer gauge for a wstETH/cbETH pool on Balancer Ethereum.**
> * **The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP)**. E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.
> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception**. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.
> * **The pool has already been launched [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF7A826D47c8E02835D94fb0Aa40F0cC9505cb134).**

> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)

> ## Protocol description
> 
> * Lido's wrapped stETH (wstETH) is stETH which is deposited into the stETH wrapper to create a new token called wstETH. stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)
> * Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) represents your staked Ethereum (ETH) in a tradable form. You can unwrap cbETH at any time. cbETH provides flexibility to sell, transfer, or use it. You can move cbETH to a personal wallet and trade it outside the Coinbase platform. - [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/coinbase-staking/staking/cbeth-intro)
> * The E-CLP uses an [internal conversion](https://github.com/gyrostable/vaults/blob/main/contracts/eclp/GyroECLPPool.sol#L723) to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.

> ## Motivation
> 
> We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency significantly. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:
> 
> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.
> 

> * The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are illustrated by the recently deployed stMATIC/wMATIC E-CLP. The below box plot shows stMATIC/wMATIC liquidity utilisation. The stacked area chart shows how the E-CLP already reached up to 55% of the total market share of stMATIC on Polygon soon after inception, with only a fraction of total TVL.

>  ![gyro2.png](ipfs://bafybeifiprubxky4vdikxilkbt5joms4aaihk2b2r25jruimh6jb6xf6bu)
> 
> * E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs).

> >   The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.

979,"TL;DR:

- Change bveCVX voting strategy to selling bribes by default, with an option to strategically replace bribe selling with emissions if deemed reasonable by the Council.
- Take the following fees in vote weight:
        5% to support DAO operations
        5% to support bveCVX/CVX LP emissions
        5% to support BADGER/WBTC CVX & CRV yield 
- Rewards from the bribe selling would be distributed in 75% bveCVX / 25% Badger.
- bveCVX would keep participating in the Boost as native balance per BIP 85 3 and also would become available as collateral on Rari while keeping the rewards and the Boost power.
- Stop distributing Badger and cvxCRV from the emissions schedule to bveCVX unless it’s deemed cost-efficient to buy the vote weight from it.

This Temperature Check seeks the community's input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Base mainnet, expanding Aave to a unique, OP-stack network.

## Background

Base is an open-source, developer-friendly L2 EVM blockchain, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. Base is incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase’s on-chain products and a sandbox for permissionless development.

Coinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launch of Base to help realize the Optimism superchain vision. Base testnet is currently live — and mainnet soon around the corner.

Docs are available at [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/)

Its mission and identity are stated clearly in the docs: ***Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users to web3.***

As a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective’s mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.

Four key principles have shaped Base that will continue to guide its approach:


**Open-source**

Base is built on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase is joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone.




**A bridge, not an island**

Base is optimized for easy, secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, as well as other L1 ecosystems like Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. Builders and users may start on Base, but go everywhere Base is a “bridge” for users into the crypto economy.



**Decentralization** 

 Decentralization is essential for the crypto economy ""to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone.” Coinbase is deeply committed to progressing toward full decentralization over the years ahead.


**For everyone**

Base is a vision to be an open ecosystem, seeded with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life.

 
Base has launched with a diverse array of launch partners, servicing different developer and user needs across data, block explorers, bridging, custody, DeFi, and others.

Please see the list below of robust launch partners:

 
![dd6a532ab00053c11ed6070d651915f493105e81_2_1380x712.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihs7se4xncwxlk4lrb3t4lkcsx2o2gkjqj6pt6rxplamuho5b2znm)
    

## Motivation

The Aave community has voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase across other prominent L2s such as Arbiturm, Metis, and Optimism.

By enabling Base on Aave, it creates valuable (and differentiated) revenue opportunities for Aave, capturing the growth and interest of users who live on the Coinbase platform.

Base is a way for Aave to instantly leverage Coinbase’s products and distribution: seamless Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to **110mm+** users and **$80B+** assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.

In the first week of Base, 18k developers deployed 55k smart contracts on testnet. This activity sustained through the network's announcement has the potential to introduce new, valuable users to DeFi and Aave.

Since Base's testnet launch on 02/23/2023, metrics illustrate strong activity:

* 2,000,000 accounts created
* 17,000,000 transactions
* 1,000,000+ addresses holding a Base Builder NFT for participating in in Quests

In addition, Base has shown impressive retention for a blockchain, with ~70,000 unique wallets returning to Base for subsequent transactions within one day. The users, likely early developers, paint a promising outlook for the activity that may be seen on mainnet.

## Specification

This *TEMP CHECK* presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Base mainnet on day one of its launch.

Suggested risk parameters for this asset are provided in the table below.

## Disclaimer

The information provided above about Base is from public sources and Flipside Crypto cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.

For full disclosure, Coinbase partnered with Flipside Crypto upon the announcement of the network to make Base on-chain data available for free for analysts.

Coinbase has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and we are doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.

As a cautionary measure to prevent an appearance of a conflict of interest, Flipside will abstain from voting on this proposal - in line with other proposals we put forward.

This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.

## Next Steps

**Temperature Check:** Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Base Mainnet.

**ARFC:** If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.

**AIP:** If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.

The rewards of whatever investment is proportional to the risk, not to the weight of it's Liquidity. 

The last increased of ""key farms"" have impacted negativity the others farming which have more risk because are from new projects, that's why its rewards were attractive for the community support.

They liquidity is so important  keeping it balanced, and the providers of BTC, ETH, BNB, BUSD, USDT and others mentioned on the last voting, don't take the same risk than others because they are stronger coins. 

So, in order to be attractive and to reward accordingly to the risk, I propose to revoque the last voting when were increased the following farms

Authorize the PoolRecoveryHelper contract to put Weighted and ComposableStable pools in Recovery Mode
Authorize Balancer Labs Ops Multisig to manage the RecoveryModeEnabler contract


# Motivation

It has recently come to our attention that rate providers can cause some operations to revert if the call to `getRate` reverts. This goes undetected by most order routing algorithms, which assume rates change slowly and only use the pool's internal rate cache for estimating the expected outputs of a transaction.

In order to prevent pools with faulty rate providers from interfering with order routing algorithms, Balancer Labs has developed the [PoolRecoveryHelper](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20221123-pool-recovery-helper), a smart contract which performs checks on all rate providers of a given pool and puts the pool into Recovery Mode if one of the rate providers reverts.

The notion of Recovery Mode was introduced in recent pool factories. Only addresses authorized by Balancer Governance can put pools in Recovery Mode. 

When a pool enters Recovery Mode, any protocol fees it owes at that time are forfeited and a new exit kind is enabled, that bypasses updating the rate cache.

When a pool is put in Recovery Mode, this fact is recorded in the subgraph and order routing algorithms can ignore the pool.

The PoolRecoveryHelper contract is permissionless. Anyone can trigger a check, but the pool will only be put in Recovery Mode in the event that the rate provider required for that pool to work properly reverts.

The contract can only interact with pools deployed from a set of factories. The initial set includes the [ComposableStable](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220906-composable-stable-pool) and [Weighted](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220908-weighted-pool-v2) pool factories deployed in September. If approved, this proposal will also authorize the Balancer Labs Ops Multisig to add/remove factories to/from this set - but in addition to that safety mechanism, permissions will still have to be granted by Governance for each new factory individually just like in this proposal.

990,"The  way the system is right now is unfair to both Stakers and Projects. This proposal seeks to create a level playing field.

In the past, new projects would typically start at very high interest and spend several days with interest rates in the 100s. In this scenario the 48 hour rule made sense.

Everything has changed now. The last project was at 86% within 20 minutes of launch! Worse yet, I was unable to see the interest rate until AFTER I had staked my CAKE!

After all the waiting, if I would have known, as nice as the project may be, I never would have staked my coins.

When a new project is launched there always seems to be a stampede. People assume they can get better rates if they get in in early. This puts a load on the network and rewards those with a faster computer or better internet connection.

From a project perspective, projects that still have high interest rates after 48 hours have a competitive edge.

This proposal seeks to level the playing field for all by removing the restriction when the interest rate reaches say 90%.  This would slso cut down on the stampede.",bullish
991,"The current win products have one thing in common, they all only involve user funds. This led me to believe that the PancakeSwap team cannot or finds it too risky to use their own capital in the win collumn, and I support this decision.

We can't have Blackjack or a dice game here because these games have a dealer, and thus requires capital that the PancakeSwap team cannot or finds it too risky to do.

However this is limiting the potential of the win collumn, so I propose a solution.

Make something similar to a staking pool (I'll call it the dealer pool from now on), but the funds gets used as the dealer's funds.

The profit from the dealer pool will be distributed to the users who have a stake on the dealer pool, of course loses will be deducted.

PancakeSwap gets a percentage of the profits from the dealer pool and will be used to burn CAKE, however PancakeSwap will not reimburse any users that have a stake on the dealer pool for any loses.

Gambling games always favor the dealer statistically, so the users who have a stake on the dealer pool can expect profits more than loses.

I believe that the best we can use as dealer funds in the dealer pool is BUSD or other stablecoins. Because we can already get yield from CAKE and stablecoins are well.. stable. This also gives users the ability to get yeild on their stablecoins.

If this is implemented we can get a lot more games on the win collumn and PancakeSwap's capital will not be at risk. This also gives PancakeSwap more revenue, hence more burns that benefit CAKE holders.",bullish
992,"# Summary
We are thrilled to present this budget proposal on behalf of Aave Companies and our ongoing commitment to support the Aave Community. This proposal will enable the Aave DAO and Aave Companies to collaborate and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem and drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption at key events like DevConnect, rAAVE, and ETHGlobal Istanbul.

# History
Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, and stakeholders.

Aave Companies recognizes the fundamental importance of the Aave Grants DAO in nurturing the DeFi ecosystem and has consistently provided support to the AGD through direct collaboration. Historically, Aave Companies has worked alongside AGD to bring sponsorship and presence at hackathons and events, designed and created the highly coveted Aave merch, and brought rAAVE to life in various cities across the globe.

# Overview
Aave Companies is requesting a budget allocation of $550,000 paid in GHO for the remainder of 2023 to support a range of activations and events to continue growing and nurturing the global Aave Community. These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:
1. Sponsoring Hackathons: Aave Companies intends to sponsor hackathons to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as the new stablecoin, GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2 but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem.
2. Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences allows the Aave community to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge and industry insights. These events often include panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts. Side events are also where Aave is able to show our commitment to inclusivity and diversity in the web3 ecosystem by tapping into new communities and audiences. We’re proud to be supporters of groups such as SheFi and BoysClub.
3. Merch: Aave Companies recognizes the importance of high-quality merchandise in building brand recognition. We intend to continue to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement efforts as well as to proliferate the ghost. We will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials, and creating merch people actually wear, use, and love.
4. Development of the GHO Pass: With one of the core missions of the Aave community being to grow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity, we’re excited to announce Aave Companies’ development of the GHO Pass. The GHO Pass V1 will facilitate GHO purchases at both Aave events and events we sponsor. We plan to launch GHO Pass at DevConnect, where users can get early access to a select group of rAAVE tickets and drink credits, exclusive merch, and other perks.
5. rAAVE: To celebrate and give back to the Aave community, we plan to host another edition of our vibrant and highly demanded event, rAAVE. Such events serve as an excellent opportunity for building “hype” around the Aave brand and creating a memorable experience for the Aave community. We will also explore live streaming rAAVE, and integrating GHO pass (as mentioned above). We will continue to manage ticketing logistics, press relations, as well as rAAVE social media.

# Activations
Activations continue to be a key focus and driver of growth for the Aave ecosystem thanks to:
- Creating a welcoming, engaging and memorable experience at the Aave booth.
- Sponsoring side events, hackathons, prizes and providing exceptional support to developers.
- Spreading Aave’s culture by distributing highly coveted merchandise.
- Selectively hosting rAAVEs to bring the Aave community together, reward contributors and make Aave the top ecosystem in crypto.
- Developing GHO Pass payment portal.

| Name  |  Date  | Details |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ETH Global Istanbul  | Nov 17-19  | During the week of Devconnect. ETHGlobal puts on arguably the most reputable hackathon events in the Ethereum ecosystem. Istanbul is a community with substantial and growing crypto adoption and is a prime market to engage hackers and the community with Aave and GHO.  |
| rAAVE  | Nov TBD  | rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem. We will host one rAAVE during the course of this proposal that is powered by GHO to help spread adoption and awareness.  |
| Devconnect + Side Events  | Nov 13-19  | This will be the event of the year in the Ethereum community. Hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, this event will be one of the most attended web3 events of 2023. Activating here will allow us to reach a wide audience and connect with many from our community.  |
| Side Events	  | Q4  | Side events we’re currently considering include: SheFi Summit Istanbul, Certora at DevConnect, Scroll Day, notDevcon by ITU Blockchain, StableSummit Istanbul. Funds from any side events that are not confirmed will be rolled over to the next potential side event.  |

For this proposal, Aave Companies is focusing on sponsoring fewer events, while increasing the quality of Aave’s presence.

A majority of the new event spend will be used to have an impactful presence during Devconnect, ETHGlobal Istanbul, and rAAVE in order to drive hackers to build with GHO and to increase GHO utilization within the wider community. Since Devconnect week will be the marquee event of the year, any remaining budget after our main sponsorships will be allocated to side events related to DeFi or Smart Contract Security.

# Next Steps
- If Snapshot is successful then move to AIP

# Conclusion
Aave Companies is deeply committed to the Aave community. We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of $550,000 paid in GHO for activations and events will not only enrich the ecosystem but also foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition. We look forward to the DAO’s support in enabling these initiatives to come to life and continue to drive the growth of the Aave ecosystem. We will rollover excess budget to Q1 2024 events.",neutral
993,"#### ABSTRACT

In the current format of forum.apecoin.com, it is currently difficult to follow the status of an AIP once it has been sent to the Special Council for Administrative Review. This is between AIP Drafts and Withdrawn AIPs (for returned AIPs) or Live AIPs (if it has been approved to vote). This proposal seeks to add a category on Discourse to easily identify those under Special Council review.

#### OVERALL COST

This is a procedural and process update; there are no direct expenses to implement this AIP.

994,"## Introduction/Abstract

On April 18th the funding of the Balancer DAO for Q2 was ratified [[1](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xe05bc1a898797cd8f78f86bed25bac84efade2df1a959daee09f8dd7c69d3b36)]. As part of the proposal 21,250 BAL and $127,500 USDC was requested for contributor compensation. With the recent market downturn the ops multisig does not have sufficient BAL to pay the expected June Balaries (See here how discounted veBAL compensation is calculated [[2](https://balancergrants.notion.site/Compensation-cb303e0241d94d96bed110929947029d)] ). The proposal is to:

* ops subDAO Multisig [[3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325#tokentxns)] swaps its remaining USDC (expected to be 76892 USDC) after USDC Balaries for June with the treasury for the additional BAL required to pay out June Balaries in BAL (expected to be 22805 BAL ). This amount of BAL was calculated based on a BAL price of $3,66 on June 18th. After June has commenced the remaining BAL in the ops subDAO multisig will be sent back to treasury.

## Motivation

Preservation of USDC available for the Balancer DAO can be the prudent choice in the current market conditions. Therefore a swap of BAL (from the DAO treasury) <> USDC (from the ops subDAO Multisig ) with the Balancer DAO treasury would retain USDC on the DAO’s balance sheet and manage to pay the Balaries for June for people who are looking to get their Balary as discounted $veBAL.

## Risks (if applicable)

* While the ops subDAO made best efforts to poll contributors for their expected Balary, the official determination will happen at the end of the month via our monthly health-check.
* BAL price falls below 3,66 by the end of the month and a new proposal needs to be voted on to request the additional $BAL due to the decreased price of $BAL.

## Specification

* ops subDAO ( 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325 ) sends 76892 USDC to Balancer DAO treasury.
* Balancer DAO treasury ( 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f ) sends 22805 BAL to the ops subDAO multisig.",bullish

996,"**PROTOCOL REVENUE SHARING FOR POOL & FACTORY CREATORS**

**BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION**

Daoism Systems is a consultancy of computer scientists, engineers, and researchers developing on-chain solutions for web3 organizations, founded in Berlin in January 2022. Please read our manifesto 1 for more details.

Our integrative expertise in decentralized technologies and applied research are at the core of our process. In our approach, we offer end-to-end solutions to develop resilient infrastructures for our clients; from the initial idea, to writing technical specifications, developing the product and maintaining it. Our team is continuously growing and currently consists of 15 people, 80% of whom are web3 developers.

Our team members have been developing web3 solutions since 2017, and the Daoism Systems team has been an active development force in the Balancer ecosystem, especially by developing PrimeDao’s main products - Pools and Launch. This proposal is an initiative of our team to establish stronger relationships between Daoism Systems and Balancer, as well as bring our expertise to further expand Balancer’s ecosystem.

**GOALS**

Referring to the proposal from February 11th 6, we truly believe that the implementation of the protocol for revenue sharing for pool and factory creators will not only improve Balancer’s governance effectiveness, but also increase the attractiveness for developers to create new products on top of Balancer.

**SOLUTION**

Our approach is to set up a dedicated team that will work exclusively on this project. For the development of an automated and permissionless model for revenue sharing with pool creators, we will provide the following resources and approach:

1.	Technical specifications: Before starting to develop, we will set up a complete technical specification, containing a detailed description and architecture of our solution.

2.	Development: After some iterations (if needed) and Balancer’s approval of the technical specifications, we will start to develop. For this task we will provide the following team:

* 1 x FTE Tech Lead: will lead the development and align the developers.
* 1 x FTE Senior Solidity Engineer: will write, test and deploy Solidity smart contracts.
* 1 x FTE Solidity Engineer: will also write and test smart contracts.

3.	Audit: After the code is written and deployed, an independent auditor will review the code and compile an audit report. If there are any suggestions for improvement, we will implement them in the code (please note: payment for the audit is not a part of the proposal).

**BUDGETING AND TIMELINE**

**Cycle 1 - Tech Specs**

For the technical specifications, including the iterations, we require two weeks.

As we are looking to develop a long-term partnership with Balancer, we love to put “skin in the game”, therefore we are requesting 4000 BAL for this step.

* Duration: 2 weeks
* Reimbursement: 4000 BAL

**Cycle 2 - Development**

The development, including an independent code audit, is expected to take three months.

For the provision of developers, we have the following prices:

* 0.5 x FTE Tech Lead: 6.5K USDC per month
* 1 x FTE Senior Solidity Engineer: 10K USDC per month
* 1 x FTE Solidity Engineer: 7,5K USDC per month
* 1 x Management Fee: 1000 BAL per month

For the independent code audit, there will be a separate proposal.

* Duration incl. Audit: 3 months
* Reimbursement:
o	24K USDC & 1000 BAL per month for the first two months (100% FTE)
o	12K USDC & 1000 BAL for the third month (50% FTE because of audit)

**UPDATE 07/19/2022 - PAYMENT CONDITIONS:**

As discussed with the community, we have adjusted the payment conditions as follows:

* 60K USDC paid upon approval
* 7000 BAL is being sent after the deliverables are met and Orb Collective signs off that the work was completed to specifications

TOTAL FUNDING AMOUNT

60000 USDC and 7000 BAL

997,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal aims to expand the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem through the creation of an animated series pilot and three spin-off comic books, featuring characters owned by ApeCoin DAO holders. We envision a gritty, action-packed, and comedic, anime-inspired adaptation of the American Ape comic book series that prominently features ApeCoin as the primary currency of the Metaverse, reaching beyond the echo chamber of “Crypto Twitter” that is primed to be pitched directly to international streamers via our producing team’s existing development, production and distribution pipelines.

#### OVERALL COST

The team is requesting $300,000 USD in $APE to produce the animated series pilot and three (3) spin-off comics, expanding the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem’s lore and raising awareness of the ApeCoin ecosystem through an ongoing mainstream animated television show and secure an international distribution deal for the comic books.

*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",bullish
998,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-increase-aave-captier-from-cap3-to-cap4-10m-30m/924).

This is a proposal to raise the liquidity mining cap from $10M to $30M for $AAVE

# The Proposal

After the activation of the Balancer Based Safety Module yesterday, the liquidity for $AAVE quickly crossed the 30M mark as new LPs join the AAVE/BAL incentivized Safety Module. Current APY by staking in the Safety Module is 350%, only considering the AAVE rewards, which will presumably attract a lot of liquidity, making Balancer the best protocol to trade AAVE on chain.

# What is The Safety Module?

The Aave Safety Module acts as a collateral for the whole Aave ecosystem. AAVE holders, and now - with the new Balancer Based Stake - AAVE/ETH holders benefit from long term rewards for securing the protocol from insolvency, while at the same time bearing the risk of being slashed in case of shortfall events. 
Having a very liquid onchain market and a consistent capital allocated in the Safety Module greatly increases the safety of the Aave ecosystem and the Aave protocol liquidity providers.",bearish

hey buddy,
It's very easy.

Let's create a new lottery :

Pancakeswap smartcontract buy a pancakesquad NFT. The NFT is put in the prize pool.
Users buy tickets with native chain token (ETH, BNB...), 5$ per tickets.
Once we manage to get 1.5x the price of the NFT with the amount of ticket sold, a winner is chosen.

so let's say the last pancakesquad NFT bought by pancakeswap smartcontract cost 1500$, once 2250$ (1,5x1500$) of ticket are sold (max 450 players) a winner is chosen.

""DZAR tokens are backed by nothing. Buyers have no claims to Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd's assets which own the deposits that you make to get DZAR. The DZAR peg to ZAR (fiat currency) is kept at voluntary efforts of Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd. and the pegging can be terminated at any point in time at discretion of Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd.""

DZAR can print unlimited amounts of tokens at their sole discretion.

DZAR gets pooled in many 8 asset pools. These pools are as safe as the weakest currency, DZAR going to 0 will drain these pools to 0. There are millions in these pools. If DZAR prints unlimited amount of tokens, it will drain all these pools, generate large losses and bad publicity.

Title: [ARFC] Add gmETH on Arbitrum V3
Discussions: [[TEMP CHECK] Add gmETH on Arbitrum V3](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-gmbtc-on-arbitrum-v3/16392?u=saucyblock)
Author: @0xlide - @SaucyBlock 
Date: 2024-02-05

## Summary
This publication presents the community an opportunity to add gmETH on the Arbitrum Aave v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Motivation
GMX Protocol is the largest DEX offering derivatives and one of the most popular DeFi’s today. The introduction of several new features and integration with Chainlink Data Stream in GMX V2 has significantly reduced the risks of front-running and price manipulation compared to GMX V1. gmETH is a ETH-USD's Liquidity Token on the GMX V2 and earn fees from leverage trading, borrowing fees and swaps. 

Integrating gmETH as collateral asset in the Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool has the potential to create new demand for borrowable assets on Aave V3.

## Specification 
Ticker: gmBTC

1009,"# Summary

Amend Interest Rate parameters for TUSD and BUSD Aave V2 deprecated markets.

# Motivation

Currently, the highly aggressive interest rate strategy implemented for TUSD and BUSD markets, with the primary objective of deprecating, poses a challenge due to the distribution of bad debt within these markets, as illustrated below:

 
![1.png](ipfs://bafkreidmfair53z6osgzslk3qhatn2zntdlyhwpumdzgafxdprjm76sqpy)
    
 
![408a1f80bd6798130e450becca1c2c6c4dcab2ab.png](ipfs://bafkreigfc4egvnpzhgh2yqk6rt625ycde4qorxaqpg6bon3fy2jspsdltm)
    
Due to a significant amount of bad debt in these markets, the anticipated outcome of incentivizing debt repayments may not be realized to the same extent, alternatively resulting in effective virtual debt growth. Although the elevated reserve factor allows the collector to cover a substantial portion of the remaining aToken underlying claims of the respective market as other positions are repaid (provided the collector does not withdraw), this debt growth must be addressed. Otherwise, it could potentially escalate to an arbitrarily high market size, given the magnitude of the current interest rate.

# Recommendations

1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.
2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.

1011,"The Venus community delegators are submitting this proposal on behalf of OpenZeppelin. 

Summary

OpenZeppelin has proposed a Security Partnership with Venus protocol for performing security audits on retainer. 

OpenZeppeling currently planned list of audits for Venus new product releases are:

-New Liquidator contract
-Diamond Comptroller
-Automatic allocation of income and Prime contract
-Collecting needed tokens and Shortfall handling (Automated Treasury Management)

As Venus’s trusted security partner, OpenZeppelin will perform continuous security audits of Venus codebases and provide actionable feedback to help the development team improve smart contract security. They offer a total of 24 weeks of security research time to be used over the next 6 months for audits as directed by the Venus dev team, which includes fix reviews and a high-level analysis of current protocol security. The total cost is $554,400 to be paid in USDC on a quarterly schedule from the Venus treasury, starting with $277,200 at the start of Q3 2023 followed by the same amount at the start of Q4.

About OpenZeppelin

OpenZeppelin is a leading blockchain infrastructure security firm that performs security audits and provides developer tools for decentralized systems that power multimillion-dollar economies. OpenZeppelin has set industry standards for building secure, decentralized systems and has gained the trust of industry leaders including Coinbase, the Ethereum Foundation, Matter Labs, and the original Compound protocol. OpenZeppelin built and maintains the world’s leading Open Source library for smart contract development with more than twenty millions downloads and 200 contributors.

OpenZeppelin has already seen success in security partnerships with DAOs including Compound, which forms the backbone of the Venus Protocol codebase. They have already leveraged their existing expertise in lending protocol security to audit the Venus SwapRouter and Oracles codebases for Venus in which they reported 25 total security issues. 

Partnership Offerings

Continuous Security Audits on Retainer: As Venus’s trusted security partner, OpenZeppelin will do a continuous security audit of our codebases. Unlike individual audit engagements, their security researchers will be assigned to work on Venus for the duration of this engagement. This provides scheduling flexibility, enhances auditor knowledge of Venus codebase and builds a more collaborative client-auditor relationship to produce better results. In addition to formal auditing, OpenZeppelin will offer Venus protocol security advisory on Web3 best practices to improve secure code development going forward.

**Summary:**
DFX Finance’s proposal to add a gauge for the 40DFX-20USDC-40TEL - Polygon

**References/Useful links:**
Link to:
Website: [Main Website](https://dfx.finance/), [dApp](https://app.dfx.finance/)

• Documentation: [Gitbook](https://docs.dfx.finance/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@dfxfinance)

• Github Page: [Github](https://github.com/dfx-finance)

**Protocol Description:**

DFX Finance is a decentralized foreign exchange (FX) protocol that facilitates the seamless exchange of fiat-backed stablecoins denominated in a growing number of currencies. Using a hyper-efficient AMM, optimized for low volatility trading, DFX provides FX swaps with rates that will beat any bank, money changer, or FX platform. DFX is the governance token of DFX Finance which allows users to vote on protocol changes and initiatives of the DAO, and also allows users to receive boosted emissions on deposits within the DFX ecosystem.

**Price History DFX:**

Price History for DFX can be found on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dfx-finance)

**Motivation:**

The DFX token on L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon is migrating from a bridged token to a Chainlink CCIP token. As well, DFX Finance is committed to continue to engage in the Hiddenhand Finance ecosystem in a meaningful way to further deepen DFX liquidity onchain.

**Specifications:**

1. Governance: DFX tokens serve as the governance token for the DFX Finance protocol. DFX token holders can vote on governance proposals through DFX’s snapshot. DFX forum is also used to discuss potential protocol changes and improvements.
2. Oracles: DFX token does not rely on any external oracles. The DFX stablecoin pools uses Chainlink for its real world forex price feeds to facilitate efficient stablecoin swaps close to the spot price. The feeds can be found here: [Decentralized Price Reference Data | Chainlink](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/fiat)
3. Audits: DFX has engaged with multiple auditors including engagements with Trail of Bits, Haechi, and Zellic to audit the DFX smart contracts.
4. Centralization vectors: Treasury functions are controlled by a 2/4 multisig including treasury yield farming, and paying bribes.
5. Market History: DFX has been transferable since March 2021.
6. Value: This pool will be the primary source of liquidity for DFX on Arbitrum and Polygon

1017,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Bril Finance’s Integration to Position Manager on BNB Chain!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re excited to announce an extension for CAKE rewards on Bril’s vaults. 

Bril Finance offers a DeFi integration that helps users manage their assets, optimize their earnings, and reduce the effort needed for managing positions. 

Users can deposit single-sided assets into Bril's vaults which are managed by Bril's smart contracts. These smart contracts will allocate the assets into PancakeSwap's v3 AMMs with a range of automated liquidity strategies to earn CAKE yield for users.

The CAKE rewards on Bril’s vaults have been adjusted to ensure **CAKE is distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner for CAKE holders.**

#### Bril Finance’s Vaults & Liquidity Pools:

Deposit single-sided assets to earn additional CAKE rewards on top of LP rewards. (Please note that the deposit token is the **first token** in the pair).

For example, for the **USDT**-WBNB (0.05%) pair, users will deposit USDT ONLY, and the SC will execute strategies to utilize the deposited USDT for the USDT-WBNB (0.05%) LP.


Vaults with an additional 1,200 CAKE rewards:
- **WBNB**-CAKE (0.25%)
- **USDT**-CAKE (0.25%) 
- **BTCB**-CAKE (0.25%)

Vaults with an additional 500 CAKE rewards:
- **USDT**-WBNB (0.05%)
- **BTCB**-USDT (0.05%)
- **ETH**-CAKE (0.25%)

CAKE rewards will be distributed with the following criteria:
- **Distribution duration:** 14 days
- **Total tokens:** 5100 CAKE 
- **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 13 Nov 2023
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 27 Nov 2023

The CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from Bril’s vaults will encourage more users to deposit single-sided assets, increasing LP liquidity, and ultimately leading to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

| Image taken from our [**tokenomics page**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics) |

Before the Finish Time of 27 Nov 2023, we will evaluate the performance of the vaults, and if appropriate, determine whether further incentivization would benefit CAKE holders.

#### Bril’s Manager Fee

There will be a **7%** manager fee introduced on all LP rewards earned via Bril Finance’s vaults.

#### How do you deposit into Bril’s Vaults?

Deposit single-sided assets into Bril’s Vaults on PancakeSwap’s Position Manager:

https://pancakeswap.finance/position-managers

#### What is the difference between Bril Finance and ICHI?

Bril Finance and ICHI are partnering to provide users with the above single-sided asset vaults. 

Bril Finance will be the user-facing interface, while ICHI will handle the smart contracts for the vaults.

**Summary:**
H2O Data has been a staunch supporter of psdnOCEAN/OCEAN LP ($950K TVL) on Balancer from the outset. psdnOCEAN serves as a liquid staking token for veOCEAN. Much like veOCEAN, it accumulates rewards, but stands apart as it can be converted back into OCEAN via the LP at any moment, highlighting the criticality of pool liquidity. The pool's liquidity was spurred by OCEAN rewards courtesy of H2O Data. However, with the introduction of the Gauge, BAL/AURA emissions will now further fuel the incentive for liquidity provision, amplifying the pool's attractiveness.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/H2O_data; 

**Protocol Description:**

> H2O protocol is a protocol related to the emerging Data and AI economy (DataFi). Originating as a fork of RAI by Reflexer, H2O Data emerged in 2022 as a non-pegged stable asset backed by OCEAN. It has since transitioned towards crafting liquid staking derivatives aimed at governing non-liquid Data Infrastructure Tokens. The first token that was launched is psdnOCEAN which is a liquid staking derivative of veOCEAN.  
Upon locking veOCEAN, users can garner rewards from both Active and Passive Data Farming. Unlike psdnOCEAN, veOCEAN is not a transferable asset. veOCEAN aligns closely with veCRV in functionality, accruing rewards while necessitating active vault management from users, adhering to the protocol until their lock tenure concludes (with a maximum lock of 4 years). psdnOCEAN, as a liquid staking token of veOCEAN, parallels the cvxCRV - veCRV dynamic. It empowers users with liquidity, enabling them to continue reaping rewards. This comes with a minor fee levied by the H2O Data protocol overseeing psdnOCEAN, ensuring users maintain liquidity while still enjoying rewards.


**Motivation:**

> psdnOCEAN/OCEAN pool is highly important to H2O Data and OCEAN, as it is the only pool which users can use to exit/entry the psdnOCEAN ecosystem. Additionally, users are incentivized to provide liquidity into this pool as they will be eligible for OCEAN and PSDN rewards. The proposed gauge will give the chance to incentivize even higher rewards for the pool, thus bridging the gap between psdnOCEAN-OCEAN even further. 
The current sustainable yield for providing liquidity to the pool is around 20%. We expect to significantly increase the APR with enabling Balancer Gauge, via Aura. After that, the pool would naturally grow and attract even further user base into the ecosystem. Additionally, we expect to facilitate even further incentivization with Aura or alternatively Hidden Hand, our partners through New Order Incubator. 


**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** 
> H2O Data is currently governed by $PSDN & $vlPSDN, a governance token of H2O Data and a Balancer LP token 80PSDN-20WETH pool respectively. PSDN can be purchased on the open market, or obtained by participating in psdnOCEAN/OCEAN LP. There is a discussion to further establish governance under psdnOCEAN, where the psdnOCEAN LP and everything related is managed solely by psdnOCEAN & psdnOCEAN/OCEAN LP token pro-rata. The vote/discussion is yet to be finished.
 

2. **Oracles:** 
> The protocol does not rely on external oracles.

3. **Audits:** 
> There were several audits, including the audit of psdnOCEAN, the token discussed in the proposal: https://docs.h2odata.xyz/protocol-overview/audits

4. **Centralization vectors:** 
> psdnOCEAN is not upgradeable.
The team is unable to mint infinite psdnOCEAN.
 Multisig is managed by 3 wallets, but the Multisig is in charge of H2O protocol and treasury, not psdnOCEAN.
psdnOCEAN is close to full ungovernance.

5. **Market History**:
> psdnOCEAN is an lsd of veOCEAN with a small discount to OCEAN, hence it reflects the price of $OCEAN.

6. **Value**: 
>The psdnOCEAN/OCEAN pool would be the primary source of liquidity for OCEAN liquid staking token, a first stop that all users of H2O data would visit to exist the ecosystem or enter the ecosystem if it is cheaper than minting. The TVL of the pool is currently $950K. The pool organically grows with psdnOCEAN liquid staking volume and OCEAN ecosystem (that is continuously launching products), contributing to the Balancer Community.

**Note**: The owner of the pool is set to Zero address, which is equivalent to `0xba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1ba1b`.

**Protocol Description:**

Manifold Finance enables and provides access to high-value transaction pools on EVM compatible chains, through our infrastructure: *SecureRPC* . They aggregate multiple endpoints along with maintaining direct access to disparate mining pools/validator nodes (Flashbots, Eden, Miners).

**Motivation:**

Current onchain liquidity is sitting at only 300k while generating in the past few days over 4m$ in volume incentives & bribes to deepen liquidity at this stage of growth is key for Manifold.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** 

Governance utilizes an architecture of elected dictator. By staking FOLD tokens, you delegate protocol control to one address (the dictator). The dictator offers a tribute (rewards) for your support. Accounts that are participating in the dictator regime may elect to vote for a new supreme dictator (operator/management for the protocol) by removing their support and reallocating it towards a new address.  
Source : https://github.com/manifoldfinance/majordomo

A known attack vector involving sandwich staking is mitigated by manually disbursing tributes. This attack vector will be mitigated by a time-dependent withdrawal period in our V2 Vault upgrade. 

> Note that this attack vector has never been actually realized, as it was caught beforehand

Protocol Fees are immediately collected in a vault which then distributes it over time (the time withdrawal is to prevent MEV attacks against the protocol in which accounts enter/exit during certain periods of time). 

A Multisig address is available. The multisig only holds tokens for the purposes of voting in governance proposals of other DAO's. This will be migrated to a vault-based permissive action list structure in which the tokens are held in-vault, with certain permissions enabled for the operator address only. 

2. **Oracles:** 

Not Applicable. 

3. **Audits:**  

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/pki#security-bug-handling-process

https://www.manifoldfinance.com/.well-known/security.txt

Additionally they maintain the DeFi Threat Matrix which is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations on decentralized finance

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/defi-threat/security/advisories?state=published



4. **Centralization vectors:** 

They utilize a concept of Permissive Action List to enable a two-step ownership process for any partner integrations. 

Centralization risks include but are not limited to:

GitHub - we perform off site backups and coordination in the event of GitHub deleting the manifoldfinance org (see LMDBX event for an example).

Google Services: We utilize a domain name not administered by Google for internal services such as user registration, etc. This is not the manifoldfinance.com email address.

Governance Discussions occur on a centralized service, Discourse. [see forums.manifoldfinance.com](https://forums.manifoldfinance.com)

There are also certain account addresses with a large amount of FOLD tokens. However we feel that due to the 'unique' governance regime that this is not in practice a risk factor as it would normally be under traditional DAO governance structures. 

5. **Market History:** 

Pool has been activated in the past 14 days and saw over 225k volume since inception on approximately 84k$ BPT with a current APR of 256% & fees of 1200$ in the past 24h.

1031,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-extend-bal-rewards-for-aave-weth-stakers/2222).

A few months ago, [this vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmUS4xSkxLCyHzJmHruLcq4rfdm8tyJoXu2dvPpNEkDn6i) was passed to allow the Liquidity Mining Committee to allocate BAL rewards for the AAVE/WETH v1 pool. The BPT from this pool is staked in the [Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module) that secures the Aave Protocol. 

## Motivation

The pool currently [contains over $500M](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81) of liquidity. Fernando has been in touch with the Aave team and they have committed to migrating the pool to Balancer v2 later this year or January at latest. As a continued show of good faith in this important partnership, we should maintain the current rate of BAL rewards (12,500 BAL per week) until January 20th, 2022. Currently our commitment to this rate of rewards is set to expire on September 20th.

1032,"#### Upgrade of UniWhale’s Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift UniWhale’s Farm rewards from the current UNW-BNB v2 LP to the new UNW-BNB v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the UNW-BNB v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the UNW token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current UNW price.)

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new Farm will have doubled emissions for the first 7 days. For example, if the v2 farm is emitting 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will emit 20 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 10 CAKE per day thereafter. 

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake UNW-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.2x multiplier
- **8 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.25% fee tier):
- Stake UNW-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.4x multiplier (0.8x multiplier for the first 7 days)
- 16 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and **8 CAKE per day** thereafter 

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 0.4x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### What is UniWhale?

UniWhale is an oracle-based decentralized perpetual exchange, where users can trade BTC, ETH, and other top cryptocurrencies with leverage.

#### What is $UNW?
From the team: “UNW is the utility token of the UniWhale ecosystem that can be traded and transferred. UNW allows users to stake and participate in the distribution of its trading fee revenues and token emissions.

Users can convert UNW into esUNW (Governance token). With esUNW, users can participate in the project's governance.”

#### **⚠️⚠️⚠️BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING⚠️⚠️⚠️**

The official UNW token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:

**https://bscscan.com/token/0x5b65cd9feb54f1df3d0c60576003344079f8dc06**

​Any other UNW token will be a scam. Always verify the token address before buying tokens. If you receive a UNW token airdrop from another address, it’s probably a scam, and we advise you to ignore it.",bearish
1033,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-authorize-lidorelayer/2136).

This proposal aims to authorize a relayer for atomically wrapping and unwrapping stETH and wstETH during typical Balancer V2 operations. The relayer would be granted authority to perform the following tasks on behalf of users **who have opted into using it**:
- Leverage the user's existing Vault allowances and internal balances to avoid duplicate approvals.
- Swap on the user's behalf.
- Add and remove liquidity on the user's behalf.

## Motivation

The upcoming wstETH-WETH meta stable pool is poised to be a huge source of liquidity for Balancer. Lido's [""staked ETH"" (stETH)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84) is a yield-bearing ERC-20 token that gives holders exposure to ETH staked in Eth2.0 validators. The design of this pool enables LPs who are long ETH to earn swap fees with minimal impermanent loss risk thanks to the high price correlation of the pool's assets. Curve Finance has a [similar pool](https://curve.fi/steth) with over $3B in liquidity at time of writing.

However, stETH is a rebasing token designed to maintain 1:1 correlation to underlying ETH, and rebasing tokens are incompatible with Balancer. Therefore, the Balancer pool actually contains not stETH but a wrapped version called wstETH which does not rebase. Because most of Lido's users hold stETH and not wstETH, this represents a UX challenge for Balancer traders, who would need to manually wrap or unwrap tokens before or after trading. The relayer seeking authorization in this proposal is designed to ease that UX burden by automatically wrapping or unwrapping stETH or wstETH within the same transaction as a swap, join, or exit.

## Risks

This proposal would only grant the required roles to the LidoRelayer contract. Each user would still be required to opt into the relayer by submitting an approval transaction or signing a message.

The code is a simple wrapper over existing Balancer pool interactions, and it has been thoroughly tested and peer-reviewed.

## Specification

The [Balancer governance multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) would submit a transaction to the [Authorizer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6#code) in order to grant the following roles to the [LidoRelayer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdcdbf71a870cc60c6f9b621e28a7d3ffd6dd4965#code):

1. `manageUserBalance`: Utilize existing Vault allowances and internal balances so that a user does not have to re-approve the new relayer for each token.
2. `joinPool`: Add liquidity to a pool on the user's behalf (for the user who holds stETH and wants to deposit to any wstETH pool).
3. `exitPool`: Remove liquidity from a pool on the user's behalf (for the user who wants to withdraw unwrapped stETH from any wstETH pool).
4. `swap`: Trade within a single pool on the user's behalf (for the user who either holds or demands stETH and wants to trade in any wstETH pool).
5. `batchSwap`: Make a multihop trade or source liquidity from multiple pools (a more complicated swap, for the same user).

Specifically, the Gnosis Safe at `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` would send a transaction to the Vault Authorizer at `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` with the following data to authorize the LidoRelayer at `0xdcdbf71A870cc60C6F9B621E28a7D3Ffd6Dd4965`:

1038,"#### ABSTRACT

ApeClub is a social network for the ApeCoin & Yuga community, which was launched only several weeks ago. In such a short period of time we have managed to attract nearly 300 BAYC holders, proving that our community is very strong and eager to integrate.

We’ve received many positive reviews and amazing feedback from community members, which encouraged us to double down on our efforts and request an ApeCoin DAO grant to accelerate our growth.

Our goal is to unite us, the entire Yuga holders community (BAYC, ApeCoin, MAYC, BAKC, Otherdeed), on one platform giving you the following value:

- Enhanced ApeCoin utility both for signup and in app features
- New relationships through meeting fellow Apes in your area
- Feeling welcome in any country worldwide, by meeting Apes while you travel
- Create business relationships with other Apes across the world
- Easily organize and attend Ape events
- Promote projects you are working on and collaborate with other community members on their projects

We feel that our platform will perfectly complement The Otherside.

#### OVERALL COST

Our operations currently consume on average $88,000 per month. We would like to request funding for the next 9 months of operations at an increased burn rate of $125,000 per month in order to achieve the goals mentioned above.

This will give us the fuel needed to onboard & satisfy the needs of the Yuga holders community, and explore various means of monetisation to fund future development and maintenance.

So our total grant request is 225,000 $APE.

The Temperature Check regarding “Delegation of UNI to Active but Underrepresented Delegates” has [passed](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x14aa7becb547ccb8fdcfc69054bda1557a90f1ebe3ac45569f049b5e29e98d76), and there was a 5-day period where delegates that met the application criteria posted their application to be considered for delegation.

There were 7 qualified delegates. This snapshot voting will be a voting weight poll where a delegate can distribute their voting power among qualified delegates.

Top 4 Delegates will get delegation till 2.5 M is achieved. The rest of UNI (out of 10 M) will be split among the rest proportional to their votes won.

Detailed example has been shared [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-delegation-of-uni-to-active-but-underrepresented-delegates/22238/21?u=doo_stablelab).

-----

*Qualified Delegates* (Order of when the application was posted)

***Wintermute Governance***

-Ever since launching our delegate profile in January, our mission has been to actively contribute to Uniswap’s governance efficiency and growth. We’ve maintained a 100% participation rate for on-chain votes (pass all participation requirements) since our delegate launch, deployed Uni V2 on Boba and Gnosis Chain, launched [WinterGov ](https://dune.com/wintermuteresearch/wintergov), and actively provided feedback to Uniswap proposals. We’d love to continue supporting the growth of Uniswap by contributing to governance efficiency, contributing to more deployments, and would be honoured if the DAO were to empower us with greater voting power!

***Keyrock***

-As a power user of Uniswap, we’re fully aligned with Uniswap’s best interest such as multi-chain expansion and improving a fair and distributed governance participation. There is a clear miss-match of voting power and participation for some delegates so we believe this initiative will not only push the less active participants to be active but also enable more initiatives by the recipients of this delegation. If we receive this delegation, we are committed to always contribute and be active within the forums while providing our perspective and expertise in matters such as liquidity provision.

***StableLab***

-StableLab is a professional delegate and governance services firm, contributing to over 20 protocols and ecosystems with exceptional diligence and participation metrics. StableLab helps DAOs scale sustainably through lean and efficient governance. We have been actively participating in Uniswap governance both via voting, forum posts, Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee, and UNI-ARB Grant Program. And we believe that with greater governance power, we will be able to support the protocol even further by helping to encourage more accountability and discussions.

***atiselsts.eth***

-As an expert in Uniswap’s technical details and someone with real-world governance experience, I am well-positioned to contribute to the DAO. Without a doubt, Uniswap is among the most significant DeFi protocols, and it’s a privilege to participate in making decisions about its future. I’ve been seriously involved in DeFi governance only recently, since the delegate race this spring, but I have quickly developed a strong affinity for it, and have participated with diligence. My voting record demonstrates a willingness to cast dissenting votes and challenge the consensus—on occasion, I have been the sole significant negative voter, as I believe entertaining contrarian arguments are essential for sound governance. If I receive the support, I will increase my participation in the forums by also regularly sharing rationale for my votes in the delegate platform thread.

***PGov***

-As a long time Uniswap Community member of over two years, I’ve watched Uniswap governance grow into a robust and thriving ecosystem. Currently, I help with two community led initiatives here being the Uniswap-Arbitrum delegate program where we help steward the DAO’s $ARB airdrop in Arbitrum governance and the Deployment Accountability Committee.

This delegation would severely help my work on the Deployment Accountability Committee as often the question of how to submit an ecosystem’s Uniswap deployment on-chain is posed. Of course, with >2.5m delegation, we can easily propose and skip that burdensome step. Being full time now at PGov, and having led the FranklinDAO platform where I utilized our delegation to propose multiple on-chain votes, I understand how important this delegation is and will promise the community to diligently represent these votes. Thanks for your consideration!

***404 DAO***

-404 DAO is a non-profit born out of Blockchain at Georgia Tech. Our team encompasses a wide range of both technical and non-technical backgrounds, from analytics and business development to cybersecurity and MEV. We seek to support the development of new applications in the Uniswap ecosystem, expanding the range of users, and accumulating value to the holders of the Uniswap governance token and relevant stakeholders. We look forward to increasing our involvement in the Uniswap DAO and are ready to take on the necessary commitment that additional voting power entails.

404 DAO is also an active delegate for Arbitrum, Optimism, and dYdX. Our team is committed to transparency - our decision process, core principles, and previous work in other protocols can be found on our [governance page ](https://404-dao.notion.site/404-DAO-Governance-519af67dccd84df7b1d9dc50312fd813).

***Karpatkey***

-karpatkey is a DeFi-native organisation specialising in professional treasury development through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We work with DAOs such as [GnosisDAO ](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkeys-weekly-report-on-gnosisdao-farms/6219), [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386), [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665), [CoW Protocol](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624), and [Lido](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xac31f800288c68e32d1eb3cea7a525022faae3eb3bf805d1b3d248cda5375a13) to diversify their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support the DAOs in their missions.

We launched our delegate platform on Uniswap in August 2023, and have been thoughtfully participating in voting and discussions over the past three month. We are also proud to have participated in the inaugural [Blessing](https://twitter.com/devinawalsh/status/1704910042028503044) sponsored by the Uniswap Foundation and focused on the Uniswap ecosystem and governance.

1044,"## Summary

This Snapshot aims to solidify the community’s preference around GHO’s starting parameters for the V3 Ethereum facilitator. 

## Voting Options

Given there is still some discussion around trade-offs between scalability and managing risk in terms of how aggressive the initial parameters should be, we believe it is best to take two options to Snapshot, option A as proposed by the ACI in consort with Chaos Labs, and option B as proposed initially by Aave Companies. The DAO’s preference can then be expressed clearly. 

For option A, the following parameters are proposed in line with the ACI and Chaos Labs’ recommendations: 

|      **Parameter**     |           **Value**           |
|:----------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|      Borrow Rate       |             1.5%              |
|    Bucket Capacity     |             $100M             |
| stkAAVE Discount Rate  |              30%              |
|    Discount Limit      | 25% of total GHO bucket size  |

For option B, as proposed by Aave Companies, the following parameters are proposed: 

|      **Parameter**     |            **Value**            |
|:----------------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|      Borrow Rate       |                2%               |
|    Bucket Capacity     |               $50M              |
| stkAAVE Discount Rate  |                25%              |
|    Discount Limit      |   25% of total GHO bucket size  |

To renew discussion at the Temp Check phase there is also an option to abstain. 

## Next Steps

Once a community preference is expressed for GHO’s initial parameters on Aave V3 Ethereum via this temp Check, there will be a separate proposal, requesting approval for a Flashminter Facilitator with initial parameters, which will go through the Temp Check process. 
 
Once both the V3 Ethereum Parameters and the FlashMinter Parameters are agreed upon via Snapshot both will be combined for a final ARFC.",neutral
1045,"### Motivation

Since the [approval of the CREAM/WETH gauge](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xa8ef52b06d2e5742e9068582276e878441c29a924e8bb2a9c26686d5284a9106) back on May 24th Balancer has earned ~$12k in protocol fees while[ spending ~$1.55M worth of BAL emissions](https://dune.com/tianqi/Balancer-Gauge-Weight). The CREAM gauge is the largest recipient of BAL emissions while returning virtually zero fee revenue to the protocol. Long term mechanisms like the recently passed [“core pools” proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x28bd2c5580f5a8effacdceb0aec52e9bc63987fa4f4a39f8b8223257ca4376cc) should help naturally correct this imbalance as market forces are given time to work though even in an optimistic scenario the CREAM gauge will remain very large for the foreseeable future.

Per [recent discussion](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/discussion-kill-cream-weth-gauge/3396) on the forum the community is split on this issue. Governance did approve the CREAM gauge in a legitimate vote and BAL was bought on the open market and locked in veBAL to vote for it. Governance also has the power to vote to kill any gauge for any reason and everyone participating in veBAL accepts these are the rules.

The Balancer ecosystem has significant funding requirements that currently far exceed our revenue generation based on the last 30 days. At this point in time the largest blocker to Balancer reaching sustainability is the existence of the CREAM gauge. There is enough support in the community for killing the gauge that it is appropriate to move this to a vote in my view - this proposal will be sent to the Governance Council for approval next Thursday, July 14th.

### Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `grantRole` on the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` with the following arguments:

account: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`

The role can be verified [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json). This will give the DAO Multisig the ability to call `killGauge` on a pool's gauge. 

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will then call `killGauge` on the CREAM/WETH Gauge `0x9F65d476DD77E24445A48b4FeCdeA81afAA63480`",bullish

Putting this idea here.

I believe that adding this section in the info page would be good as there's currently no direct way for pancakeswap users to track the token's circulating supply over time. We need to find out and calculate manually after every week's burn. 

Alternatively, the total circulating cake supply could be updated together with the weekly burn announcement on twitter.

**Summary:**

> This pool uses the composable stable pool factory v5 and contains three unique staked ethereum tokens, staked frax eth (sfrxETH), wrapped staked eth from Lido (wstETH), and rocket eth from Rocket pool (rETH). As most Balancer community members know, rocket pool and lido have become pillars of the ecosystem through the use of the metastable / composable stable pool types to leverage their yield bearing assets. Staked frax eth will be joining these two juggernauts to facilitate trading and LPing amongst these diverse staking strategies of ETH. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.

**Protocol Description:**

> sfrxETH is a Frax’s staked wrapped ETH token, wstETH is a wrapped staked ETH token for Lido, and rETH is the staked ETH token for Rocket Pool.

**Motivation:**

> Balancer is clearly pushing forward on all networks with staked assets as a key focus. By diversifying the protocols which supply staked assets Balancer opens up the door to liquidity providers to gain exposure to multiple providers, while facilitating trade routes for these assets. The protocol benefits greatly from yield bearing assets, and Balancer’s users do just as much. This pool will be a unique and diverse group of Ethereum assets making it exciting for everyone involved.

1052,"Summary
The Venus Community proposes that Venus list the stablecoin FDUSD as a core lending market on Venus Core pool.

Rationale
$FDUSD is now becoming a well-established, liquid and widely recognized stablecoin in the BNBChain decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

Motivations
$FDUSD is a 1:1 backed stablecoin. The treasury is backed 100% by cash and cash equivalents (cash, overnight reverse repurchase agreements, and T-bills). There is no investment in any other assets. Reserves are actively managed and monthly attestations are published [here 2] by their team.

Stablecoins are designed to maintain a value pegged to a specific asset, such as the US dollar. By adding FDUSD, Venus can offer its users a new reliable and secure stablecoin that can be used for various transactions within the platform. Moreover, FDUSD can enhance the liquidity of the Venus core pool. The core pool serves as the fundamental liquidity provider for Venus, enabling users to borrow and lend different assets.

By incorporating FDUSD, Venus can broaden its pool of available assets, attracting more users and market participants. This increased liquidity can contribute to a more efficient and vibrant ecosystem. Additionally, the inclusion of FDUSD in the core pool will facilitate increased adoption and usage of Venus.

By offering FDUSD, Venus can tap into a larger user base that seeks stability and can leverage the platform for their needs. This would ultimately enhance the overall utility and attractiveness of Venus as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. Furthermore, FDUSD can serve as a hedge against market volatility. In times of heightened price fluctuations, stablecoins serve as a reliable store of value for users, preventing losses and preserving the purchasing power of their assets.

In summary, the addition of the FDUSD stablecoin to Venus core pool can bring stability, increased liquidity, broader adoption, and a safe haven for users. Incorporating FDUSD aligns with Venus goals of offering a robust, user-friendly, ever growing and inclusive DeFi platform.

Proposed Parameters
(As per Chaos Labs recommendations)

Collateral Factor
Considering the relatively short track record of FDUSD, ChaosLabs recommends starting with a more cautious Collateral Factor compared to USDT and USDC in the core pool, setting it at 75%.

Supply Cap and Borrow Cap
Applying Chaos Labs’ approach to setting initial supply caps for new assets, they propose setting the supply cap at 2X the on-chain liquidity available under the Liquidation Incentive (configured to 10%) price impact.

Given the current liquidity, they recommend an initial supply cap of 5,500,000 FDUSD.

IR Curves
We recommend setting the IR curve in line with those of the major stablecoins on the Venus Core pool:

Base - 0%
Kink - 80%
Multiplier - 6.875%
Jump Multiplier - 250%
Reserve factor - 10%

As for XVS emissions, the community recommends 10 XVS/Day as an initial incentive that can be later reviewed as the market grows in liquidity and utilization on Venus.",bullish

Title: [ARFC] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market 
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-26

---

# **Summary**
This proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. 

### **Motivation**

Artemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.

artMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).

artMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.

### Benefits of listing artMETIS

We believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.

- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.
- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.
- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.
- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.

### Chain to be deployed/listed

artMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.

### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:

The Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.

Furthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.

Artemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.

In recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.

In summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.

1056,"**Summary:**
> This pool uses the new composable stable pool factory which allows us to apply the protocol fee to yield bearing tokens. bb-rf-aUSDC is `Beets Reaper Aave Boosted USDC`, which means we're using a linear pool to deposit USDC into a Reaper USDC Vault which only deposits into Aave. Reaper handles the autocompounding of any OP rewards which adds additional yield. For reference, Reaper is a fork of Yearn v2 run by the Byte Masons who are talented developers in their own right. BeethovenX has a close working relationship with the Byte Masons. In the absence of an Aave v3 compatible atoken wrapper this arrangement represents the best path forward, and arguably it's better than using a wrapper since we get the additional compounding benefit. The kind of vault we're using has held 9 figures of TVL and been thoroughly battle tested so it should add a negligible risk premium.

**Protocol Description:**

> USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO. USDT is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Tether.

**Motivation:**

> This Aave boosted 3pool will form the cornerstone of our USD stable liquidity on Optimism. The boosted APR currently stands at 3.78% which means there is quite high intrinsic yield to this pool that will persist even without our token incentives. Note that this is *after* our 50% yield fee so this is very lucrative liquidity to have. Our friends at Qi DAO are the first to co-incentivize MAI/bb-rf-aUSD and we hope to secure more partnerships like this to build around the high base yield of this pool.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Find more information about MarkerDAO governance [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/). USDC and USDT are centralized and don't have governance.

2. **Oracles:** This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned.

3. **Audits:** See [here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports).

4. **Centralization vectors:** There are centralization risks with USDC, DAI, and USDT, though the market has clearly accepted those as minor for now.

5. **Market History:** See [here]([https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin)). 
 
6. **Value:** We will earn the protocol fee on bb-rf-aUSD yield, plus trading fees. As a reminder, protocol fees on Optimism are split 50% to Balancer (passively to DAO & veBAL) and 50% to BeethovenX. Of BeethovenX's 50%, half is returned as incentives on Optimism pools either via bribes or direct LM. The other half is split between funding the team and accumulating veBAL/auraBAL/vlAURA per this [recent proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x3d6e0373f0f1c041a82e6108a01aee2e00a21be43667259126b70e5fd2a5f93a). Thus emissions towards this gauge both benefit passive veBAL *and* serve to help our flywheel accelerate our growth on Optimism.

1057,"**Summary:**

> This pool uses the new weighted pool factory and will also be utilizing the new composable stable pool form of bb-a-usd pool to pair with rETH. This means yield earned by the both halves of the pool will only be taken by the protocol in one iteration. Due to the nature of the assets, this gauge would automatically gain “core pool” status under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.

**Protocol Description:**

> rETH is liquid staked ETH from rocket pools Beacon chain staking mechanism. bb-a-usd is Balancer’s AAVE boosted stable token pool token.

**Motivation:**

> Balancer in the short term is strategically position itself as gaining control and market share of the yield bearing asset market through the use of our various pool types. This use case will not only put two yield bearing assets to work but pair greatly in terms of liquidity path for the underlying stable tokens along with rETH. The yield bearing aspects benefit LPs and the the protocol overall, while permitting a healthy and low friction trade route for aggregators and direct traders to tap in to.

2. **Oracles:** This pool will rely on a rate provider which has been in use for the rETH/ETH pool for some time. You can see it [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a8F81c256aee9C640e14bB0453ce247ea0DFE6F).

5. **Market History:** See [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth)
6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on rETH and bb-a-usd yield. This configuration is beneficial to all parties involved in market making as noted in the Motivation section.

4. **Centralization vectors:**
   * The only centralization vector is the factory owner controls the admin privileges. The factory multi-sig is a 2/3 Gnosis Safe. The capabilities that the admin has is *******pausing******* and *******setFees*******. Both of these are in place to ensure optimal operations of the pool. LPs can monitor these events and are free to withdraw liquidity at any time.

5. **Market History:**
   * Both tokens are wrapped staked ETH.
 
6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) 
   * No, the pool would need roughly $100 - 200k in liquidity to begin with. TWAMMs are extremely capital efficient because they split the trade across thousands of blocks and dedicated arbitrageurs are constantly replenishing the capital when they correct asset price deviations.
   * Nouns DAO is interested in diversifying their treasury of stETH to rETH, roughly $28M at current prices - [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10). This will be an extremely important trade to prove the concept of our protocol and make Balancer the go-to venue for treasury diversification needs.
   * Once TWAMMs become the de-facto solution for large asset swaps, we believe Balancer protocol will become the schelling point for protocols interested in advanced trade execution.

**Title:** [ARFC] Chaos Labs - Update WETH IR on V3 Arbitrum and Optimism - 02.16.2024 
**Author:** Chaos Labs
**Date:** 2024-02-16

---

### Simple Summary

Decrease slope1 on Arbitrum and Optimism from 3.3% to 3%.

### Motivation

Over the last eight months, we have observed a drop-off in WETH interest rates on Ethereum and, thus, relative demand for ETH borrowing.

*Time series of WETH borrow APY on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism, in addition to stETH APY.*


Note that the red dotted line indicates the point when the base_fee decreased from 1% to 0% on Arbitrum and Optimism. This phenomenon can be explained by the drop-off in ETH staking yield, as we can deduce through the relatively strong correlation between WETH borrow APY and stETH staking APY on Ethereum due to profitable looping strategies. Additionally, given Aave prices stETH:ETH 1:1 with the underlying exchange rate, minimal liquidation risk exists in potential wstETH market price movements.

**Correlation Between stETH APY and WETH APY**

*Cross-correlation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*

Computing the cross-correlation between the three markets, we notice an approximately 1-week lag when this hits the maximum value, implying the speed at which the borrow rates are maximally reflected in the staking APY.

This is statistically significant, as we can see below, where 85%-90% of all WETH debt is backed by ETH LSTs on the respective chain.

### stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY

Interestingly enough, one might think that as stETH yields decrease, looping strategies would become less profitable. However, upon analyzing the difference between the stETH APY and WETH borrow APY (stETH APY - WETH APY) alongside the stETH APY itself at a given time t, a negative correlation emerges, with the peak occurring at a 2-week lag. Essentially, this means that the rate of decrease in borrow APY over time outpaces that of the stETH APY. Thus, we can conclude that when stETH APYs are high, borrowers attempt to extract as much revenue as possible, leading to convergence at lower yields. On the contrary, when stETH APYs are low, borrowers and ETH borrow APYs tend to be less aggressive with looping, perhaps due to theoretical scaling in the interest rate requiring smaller growth to become unprofitable, leading to the effective yield scaling higher than instances when stETH APYs are high. This in turn leads to less efficient markets and larger spreads when ETH staking yields are low.

**WETH Utilization Rates**

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreihjpcivhoywbhley2ysf4zaaa7nqmkqtsx7f3rt33dvphemir6w4u)
    
*WETH Utilization rate time series.*

Based on the observed trend, it's evident that Arbitrum and Optimism could benefit from a reduction in slope1 to enhance utilization rates and consequently increase revenues. While the decrease in base_rate on both chains did positively impact utilization, it remains suboptimal. Thus, we simply take the P95 of the stETH APY differential vs WETH borrow APY since the base_rate decrease, which returned 0.6%, to derive the decrease in slope1. Considering the Uoptimal rate is projected to be below the current stETH APY with a 0.6% variance, any prolonged convergence above Uoptimal could lead to interest rate volatility. In such a scenario, it would be prudent to revert slope1. However, given the current trend and staking APY, this adjustment would likely result in higher utilization rates and greater profits for the Aave DAO.

Assuming convergence at today’s WETH interest rates:

|  | Arbitrum | Optimism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Old Utilization Rate | 68.69% | 65% |
| New Utilization Rate | 76.5% | 72% |
| Projected Revenue Increase | 13.62 ETH $38.5k year | 4 ETH $11.3k year |

We note that adjusting WETH slope1 on other non-Ethereum chains with this intuition is seen as irrelevant, as either the market itself portrays too small a sample size with minimal relative demand for ETH LSTs as collateral, there does not exist ETH LSTs on the chain or ETH LST supply caps have been at max capacity for months.

###  Specification

| Chain | Asset |Parameter | Currebt |Recommended |

| Arbitrum | WETH |Slope1| 3.3% | 3% |

1063,"# TLDR:

Gauntlet makes the following recommendations to optimize for risk and capital efficiency for Venus:

- Reduce BNB Collateral Factor from 80% to 75%
- Increase Borrow Caps for BCH from 4,331 to 7,000
- Increase Borrow Caps for FIL from 122,200 to 180,000


## Collateral Factor Recommendations:

- BNB: Lower CF from 80% to 75%.
 - *To clarify, Gauntlet ran an updated analysis of the protocol and this adjustment is still being recommended.*


# Methodology
This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Existing insolvencies are excluded from our simulations and VaR and LaR numbers, since we can only mitigate risk of future insolvencies. Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the Gauntlet’s Venus Risk Dashboard cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

## Risk Off Liquidations:
Whenever we lower collateral factors, there’s a chance that some users may immediately become liquidatable as a result. There are a number of accounts that lend and borrow stablecoins and keep their balances just slightly above the liquidation threshold.

Reducing the collateral factor of BNB by 5% would push 115 accounts from just above the collateral factor to just below the collateral factor. The accounts have a total borrow value of $13k. The top account has a borrow balance of $2.5k. Most of the accounts are extremely small with recursive holdings.

## Supporting Data
**Top 10 Borrowers and Borrow Usage**

The figures above show the distribution in risk among the top borrowers. A large amount of BNB is concentrated in one borrower, which could lead to insolvencies. Because of this, we can observe why a large portion of the VaR is in BNB.

## Borrow Cap Adjustment Reasoning:
Gauntlet is adjusting the borrow caps for FIL and BCH to improve user experience, as previous caps were met. Borrow caps will continue to be monitored and incrementally updated to maintain protection against manipulation.

## Risk Dashboard
The community should view the Gauntlet’s Venus Risk Dashboard to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Venus.

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile insolvency value that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile liquidation volume that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

- Adaptability: The mascot’s design can be leveraged for various marketing materials, merchandise, and promotional activities.
- Inspiration for Artists: The mascot will serve as a collaborative art subject, fostering creative contributions from artists within and outside the community. It can inspire others to also contribute to the development of the Apecoin brand.
- Narrative Element: A mascot can act as a narrator in graphics, guiding the audience and conveying the DAO’s values and mission. (Example: As a narrating character in the guide for DAO newcomers by BojangleGuy) 1
- Discord Enhancement: The mascot can be featured on DIscord in the form of emotes and stickers, supporting conversations and creating a fun and expressive environment on our Discord and others.

#### OVERALL COST

As the artist and initiator of this proposal, I kindly request a grant of $5,750 denominated in ApeCoin (breakdown see below) from the Apecoin DAO to support the mascot design project.
 The proposed budget will cover the following:
- Research and initial development of alternative designs
- Complete development process of the final mascot
- Style guide development
- ~15 Discord emojis/stickers
- ~10 graphic assets for marketing purposes
- 3D model (in collaboration)
- Complete transfer of IP ownership to the Apecoin DAO 

COST BREAKDOWN
Average hourly rate of $40
* Brand and market research and evaluating community feedback to ensure that the mascot embodies the brand and DAO perfectly (7-8h) = $300
* Sketches of variations and alternatives to choose from incl. process of gathering references and inspiration (8-10h) = $400
* Final detailed mascot character sheet incl. front, back, and side view (8-10h) = $400
* 15 discord Stickers ($40 each incl discount) = $600
* Telegram sticker set ($10 per sticker) = $150
* 10 illustrations to use for graphics, guides etc ($100 half body, $280 full body) = $1900
* 3D model (in collaboration) = $500
* Mascot guide (incl. character sheet, facial expressions and poses, color guide, material, details, accessories and variations, personality description) and usage guidelines (10-15h) = $600
* Transfer of full IP ownership (incl. renunciation of profit share from merch etc. distributed by someone else) = $1500
= ~$5750

I kindly request $5,750 denominated in ApeCoin as my budget for this project.
If everything goes smoothly and faster than expected, I would add more illustration assets to the package.

With the support and help of the Apecoin community, I’m sure I can create the perfect mascot for the Apecoin DAO.
Thank you for your time!

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - GSM Funding & RWA Strategy Preparations
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @Sisyphos & @efecarranza 
created: 2024-01-09

# Summary

In preparation for launching the GHO Stability Module (GSM) and the $1M RWA strategy with Centirfuge, this publication seeks to make available the necessary amount of USDC and USDT on Ethereum v3. 

# Motivation

The GSM is in the late stages of audit and is expected to be available for deployment in the near future. The Centrifuge proposal is currently mid way through the review process. The current stable coin holdings on Ethereum are insufficient to support the GSM, RWA strategy and Service Provider (SP) commitments. Additional funds are needed on Ethereum to support the GSM. 

The [largest GSM funding requested](https://governance.aave.com/t/gho-stability-module-update/14442/10) consisted of the following:

* 3.5M USDC
* 3.5M USDT 

The RWA Strategy is valued at [1M](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-treasury-rwa-allocation/14790) of USDC funding.

The expected aEthUSDC and aEthUSDT Reserve Holding, post Aave Funding Part B being implemented, is as shown below:

* 2.93M aEthUSDC (0.72M current holding plus 2.21M Aave Funding Part B)
* 0.71M aEthUSDT (0.71M current holding)

It is clear from comparing the numbers above, there is a need to add to the aEthUSDC and aEthUSDT holdings in order to fullfill the GSM and RWA Strategy commitments.

Tapping into the aUSDT and aUSDC holdings is not enough as the current aUSDT (Aave v2) is only sufficient to cover 1 years runway and all the aUSDC will already migrated to aEthUSDC upon implementing Aave Funding Part B.

The aEthDAI reserve holds sufficient funds to cover any [ImmuneFi Bug Bounty Program](ipns://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/325/), sustain [BGDLabs stream](ipns://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/311/), support this [bug bounty](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-request-for-bounty-payout-december-2023/15826) and this [adhoc security request](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-security-budget-request-december-2023/15783). 

At the time of writing, it is only possible to move funds between the Polygon and Ethereum Treasuries via on-chain governance. The below summaries the expected Polygon Treasury holdings based upon this [migration PR](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/pull/126) being implemented.

* 2.58M aPolUSDC
* 1.53M aPolDAI
* 0.80M aPolUSDT

There is sufficient funds on Polygon to cover the immediate needs of the GHO GSM.

In addition to the above, this proposal also contains a small bit of house keeping that includes setting two legacy aUSDC Allowances to zero. Whilst the funds mentioned can not be claimed, they are currently showing as available when querying the Allowance ([10.](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBcca60bB61934080951369a648Fb03DF4F96263C#readProxyContract)) balance.

There are several legacy allowances relating to past bonding curves that are to be [revoked](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker?search=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c). The most notable 174k and 196k, are legacy from previous [CRV](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/146) and [BAL](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115) respectiveley.

# Specification

Part A of this proposal will perform the following:

* Withdraw all amUSDC & aPolUSDC
* Withdraw all amDAI & aPolDAI
* Withdraw all amUSDT & aPolUSDT
* Transfer all withdrawn assets to Ethereum

Revoke the following allowances for the Aave Collector on Mainnet:

* Swap all DAI to USDT
* Swap 0.70M USDC to USDT
* Deposit USDT received from Polygon and swaps into Aave v3
* Deposit USDC received from Polygon minus 0.70M into Aave v3

This is expected to acheive a minimum of the following aEthUSDC and aEthUSDT balances:

* 4.81M aEthUSDC (3.5M for GSM, 1M for Centrifuge)
* 3.73M aEthUSDT

1074,"## Proposal Summary

ConsenSys is proposing a recognized Uniswap V3 deployment for its incubated zkEVM, Linea.

## Proposal Overview

Consensys is seeking a Uniswap V3 deployment for Linea’s mainnet launch, looking to further integrate Uniswap with the Consensys product ecosystem (MetaMask, Infura, Linea, et. al). A key aspect of Linea's value proposition is its synergistic relationship with ConsenSys products. Establishing Uniswap as a dominant DEX on Linea would encourage more trading volume for the protocol and strengthen ties to current Consensys product users.

## Motivation

Linea's testnet has impressively handled more than 12 million transactions. Many of these transactions are part of the ongoing Voyage quest, a crucial initiative designed to help stress-test the network. This exercise aids in identifying potential issues and performance impediments before transitioning to Linea mainnet.

Moreover, Linea is aligned with developers throughout the broader ecosystem via our relationships with MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle, emphasizing our commitment in serving developers, protocols, and builders.

Users will conveniently find Linea natively supported in the MetaMask network dropdown list, and it will support the full range of MetaMask curated experiences. These experiences include On/Off Ramp, MetaBridge, MetaMask Swaps, Portfolio dApp, and MetaMask SDK - all of which could leverage the Uniswap protocol.

## About Linea

Linea aims to be a [Type 2 zkEVM](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html) and achieve EVM-equivalence, handling native EVM bytecode for proving and verification. This allows for the execution of Solidity smart contracts and enables developers to build while using familiar tools and infrastructure at extremely low switching costs. The network does not use transpilers or custom compilers on bytecode. By taking the compiled bytecode directly from solidity, we significantly reduce the surface area risk for bugs and hacks.

Linea seeks innovation, pushing the boundaries of the Web3 space while maintaining top security and full EVM compatibility as top priorities. One (of the many) things worth mentioning is Linea’s full support of EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction). Working with key stakeholders, the network already uses the single-entry-point contract and runs multiple networks of bundlers and paymasters services.

## Vortex - Lattice-Based SNARKs

What is particularly exciting about Linea is its ability to consolidate transactions and submit proofs to the Ethereum mainnet using a novel prover mechanism. This process enhances throughput and minimizes transaction fees while maintaining the inherent security of the Ethereum network.

[Vortex](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1633), a cryptographic primitive under development at ConsenSys, aims to increase the performance of Linea. It leverages a novel type of zkProof called a recursive aggregation proof. This is based on Ring-SIS, a well-known premise from lattice-based cryptography. This proofing system enables the batching of transactions to increase the network's throughput while reducing fees. Linea also employs zk circuits to conduct computations. These cryptographic circuits facilitate secure and efficient computations.

## Market Adoption

Since the inception of Ethereum, ConsenSys was established to become the most potent proponent of decentralization worldwide. We believe that networks such as Ethereum can empower humanity to reach greater heights. With our experience handling web3 infrastructure, wallets, developer tools, public goods, and more, we are confident in our ability to steward Linea to complete decentralization and openness.

Linea is the result of more than 20 months of R&D from our award-winning research team that has released and maintains successful projects in the zk space like the GNARK library. Linea represents advancements in the zkEVM realm and the general field of cryptography. With the Linea network being incubated via Consensys, adoption will be encouraged through existing Consensys products and partnerships.

Some of these integrations include but are not limited to:

* **MetaMask** - Largest Web3 wallet, easy user onboarding with default integration.
* **Infura** - Simplified deployment lets developers ship faster and scale with the confidence of 99.9% uptime.
* **Truffle** - Build, test, debug, and deploy Solidity smart contracts with tools like Truffle, Hardhat, and more.
* **Besu** - Optimized execution for zkEVM transactions using Ethereum battle-tested components.
* **Lastly**, nearly all EVM-specific development tools are Linea compatible.

## Decentralization Roadmap

Linea is committed to actively pursuing decentralization. Over the following year, the Linea team plans to implement decentralizing features. Examples include introducing a DAO, decentralized sequencers and prover systems.

# Benefits for Uniswap

There are many benefits to a Uniswap deployment on Linea. In the following sections, we highlight our top three…

1. Early Establishment in the Linea AMM Market
2. Increased Volume through MetaMask Swaps Integration
3. Cross Promotion

## Early Establishment in the Linea AMM Market

Observing Uniswap market share across crucial Layer 2 solutions reveals that the protocol enjoys several advantages x-chain. These include a strong community, brand recognition, and, most importantly, the first-mover advantage.

Total value locked (TVL) of Uniswap across significant roll-up ecosystems:

* Arbitrum - 316.12M
* Optimism - 82.5M

We anticipate that Uniswap will replicate its success in capturing market share on Linea, and we also hope that this deployment will serve as a model for the DAO on how Uniswap will perform with all upcoming L2/zkEVM launches over the next 6-8 months.

## Increased Volume through Swaps Integration

MetaMask Swaps is an aggregation product built natively into MetaMask. Across all integrated chains, as of last week, Swaps had an average weekly volume of ~$133M. Uniswap is consistently the largest leveraged dex of this weekly volume, executing ~58%, or $77.1M of trades.

Most of this volume is directed through Ethereum; however, observing comparable L2 deployments shows that Swaps contributed nearly 100M of volume to Arbitrum since integration.

Products like Swaps leverage many service providers, and only a few of them will be deployed on Linea day 1, providing Uniswap the opportunity to capture an even bigger market share of L2 volume produced from the product.

## Cross Promotion

Another benefit for the protocol is the cross-promotion between Consensys and Uniswap, and to double down on the shared mission of contributing to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. The team plans to promote the network's usage and the protocols that operate on it. This, combined with utilizing a recognized deployment of Uniswap, will aid in establishing Uniswap on Linea and in the greater ecosystem.

# Additional Information

## Costs and Incentives

Consensys will cover all deployment costs, and is willing to contribute any engineering resources required for the deployment.

## Cross Chain Messaging

The Linea team operates and maintains a canonical Open Messaging Service (OMS). The OMS allows for messages to pass to and from Ethereum & Linea. The Ethereum network verifies smart contracts on the L1 that enforce a valid state on Linea.

## Security Considerations

The OMS will be operated in-house. The design implements a relayer and leverages the rollup to maintain state/security.

## Example Walk-Through of Cross-Chain Message Passing

A technical walk-through of the future-state, cross-chain governance on mainnet is as follows:

1. The Uniswap Governor Bravo Contract will send a message to the L1 bridge contract (implementing the IBridge.sol interface) by calling the `dispatchMessage` method.
2. The L1 bridge contract emits a `MessageDispatched` event.
3. The roll-up relayer catches the event and sends an L2 transaction to the L2 bridge contract by calling the `deliverMessage` function.
4. The L2 contract calls the contract defined in the `to` field. The L2 contract should authenticate the call by calling the `sender()` method on the L2 bridge upon reception of the `deliverMessage` call, verifying that this corresponds to a known L1 address.
5. The L1 bridge contract verifies the message execution and emits an event `MessageConfirmed`, once the next L2 block is finalized and the zk proof is verified.

**Source:** [Modified from Linea Documentation](https://docs.linea.build/developers/use-message-bridge#l1-to-l2) (links in documentation)

## Success Criteria 

Although it is difficult to quantify success criteria, we can confidently state that establishing Uniswap as an early, dominant DEX from Day 1 is a priority.

The overarching success of the Uniswap deployment will be determined through increasing key DeFi metrics that include TVL, Volume, Users, and Swaps. Upon deployment, we will provide a dashboard to monitor Uniswap’s progress and assess market performance.

**Bridge Provider:** Linea Native Bridge
**Target Chain:** Linea
**Proposal Sponsor:** Consensys

# Engagement Terms

## Linea Mainnet Timeline

Linea mainnet aims to launch in the month of July. We understand that deployment relies on mainnet, and we will proceed with the on-chain portion of this proposal at the appropriate time.

As for now, and as outlined [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-creation-of-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20961), the timing of the official recognition will occur after deployment.

## Deployment Process/Timeline

1. The request for comment will be at least seven days.
2. After, a temperature check will be made on Snapshot and remain live for five days.
*(The temperature check solely assesses the DAO's desire to deploy on linea.)*
3.  If 10m votes support the proposal, ConsenSys and the Linea team will prepare an on-chain proposal.

4. Under appropriate conditions, we will move to an on-chain vote that lasts ~11 days (7-day voting window).

As some may recall, governance approved sourcecred under [this vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmXQpKyw1BvYgZtvC2KGqrDezWBfSUBEKK77Kx866yBLYf) but the integration was never completed. Someone from sourcecred reached out to me recently and has gotten it nearly ready to use. The final piece of the puzzle is approving compensation for the team responsible for maintaining it.

## Motivation

You can read the previous vote for some context but this generally fits in with our goal of rewarding ground floor community contributors. It will be as simple as a Baller or Balancer Labs employee dropping a certain emoji on a community member’s discord message and that person will earn a small amount of BAL (one example).

From what I have been told, maintaining the sourcecred instance has social, administrative, IT, accounting, and transactional components. There will be a team of people responsible for handling all of this. **They are requesting 150-200 BAL per month.**

## Specification

It has been suggested internally that we apply a period of time to this rather than leaving it open ended. Thus, **I propose an 8 week trial period where the ecosystem fund will allocate 50 BAL per week to rewarding contributors (same as previous vote) and allocate 150 BAL per month to the sourcecred team for expenses.** At the conclusion of the trial period, governance will vote again to continue or not and at what rates. The 8 week period will begin once everything is in place which should be soon after this vote passes but can’t commit to a hard date at this time.

title: [ARFC] sDAI Onboarding on Aave V3 Gnosis Pool
author: @marczeller - Aave-chan Initiative
date: 09-10-2023
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain Pool. With the imminent deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain and the recent deployment of sDAI, we believe this integration will further enhance the utility and liquidity of the Aave ecosystem on Gnosischain.

## Motivation

- **Aave V3 Gnosischain Deployment**: The deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain is on the horizon. As outlined in the [Gnosischain deployment ARFC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-deployment-on-gnosischain/14695), sDAI was identified as a prime collateral candidate for Aave. However, at the time of the proposal's creation, sDAI had not been deployed.
  
- **Rapid Growth of sDAI**: Since its deployment, sDAI has shown significant traction, attracting $46M in just a few days. This demonstrates the community's trust and the potential of sDAI as a collateral asset in the Aave ecosystem.
  
- **Technical & Timeframe Considerations**: We propose the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain deployment, either as part of the initial deployment or through a subsequent onboarding AIP, depending on what's most optimal from both a technical and timeframe perspective.

## Specification

- **Asset**: sDAI
- **Contract Address**: 0xaf204776c7245bF4147c2612BF6e5972Ee483701

A Price sync adapter oracle considering both wxDAI value and sDAI exchange rate will be implemented as a Price feed for this asset.

### Risk Parameters

sDAI is intended to serve as a collateral asset. Given that there's minimal value in borrowing it, we propose its onboarding solely as a collateral asset, without borrowing capabilities.

1079,"Enable agEUR as a collateral in isolation mode on AAVE V3 on Polygon.

## Summary

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient.
The protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. 

agEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there.

At the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero.

There are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/polygon/pools/0x3fa147d6309abeb5c1316f7d8a7d8bd023e0cd80) and on [Curve](https://polygon.curve.fi/factory/209). 
Besides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.

Stablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism.

The stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).
The protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.

agEUR has a Chainlink feed on Polygon with USD.

## Audits

We have had four different audits which can be found [here](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits)

## Benefits for Aave V3

agEUR is already supported in efficiency mode with other stablecoins which should technically allow people to take leverage on Forex, or to arb more easily stablecoins at peg.

One thing that is not supported at the moment is borrowing against agEUR as a collateral. This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the € and short the $ through agEUR.

Right now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the €. This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future.

Relative to the size of agEUR on Aave, there’s also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment.

Doing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.



## Risk Parameters

With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters.

V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon

## Specifications 

**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**  
As mentioned in the disclaimer, I am a Core Contributor of the Angle Protocol.

**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**  
See agEUR summary section

**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**  
See Benefits for Aave section.

**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?).**  

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, it is ruled by the ANGLE token and more generally by the veANGLE token. Like many other projects, Angle DAO has indeed adopted the ve tokenomics. 

The platform was released [on November 3rd 2021.](https://blog.angle.money/angle-is-live-on-the-ethereum-mainnet-a8253162daf0).
ANGLE locking went live [in January](https://blog.angle.money/veangle-is-live-on-mainnet-4d702fcf7584). Votes by veANGLE holders are implemented by a 4/6 multisig composed of 3 core team members (including myself), [Julien Bouteloup](https://twitter.com/bneiluj), [0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xMaki) and [SebVentures](https://twitter.com/SebVentures).

**5. How is the asset currently used?**  

The asset is a € stablecoin. It is used by people as a means of exchange to pay in Euros in DeFi, or to keep a stable asset value in reserves before aping in elsewhere.

It is also used as a way to get yield in many places in DeFi

**6. Emission schedule**  

Token can only be issued following the rules of the protocol on mainnet: at oracle value if someone has provided either USDC, DAI, FEI, FRAX, or wETH. agEUR can also be borrowed from Angle Borrowing module at a 0.5% rate. 
There’s no emission schedule for the token.

**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**  

agEUR token contract on mainnet is upgradeable and can be upgraded by the [multisig ](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xdC4e6DFe07EFCa50a197DF15D9200883eF4Eb1c8/balances) described above.
agEUR on Polygon can also be upgraded by a [multisig on Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xdA2D2f638D6fcbE306236583845e5822554c02EA).

**8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**

-   **Market Cap**: €48.7m circulating, €3.7m on Polygon, market cap = FDV
-   **24h Volume**: $4m (from [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ageur?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=WkIOj7Yl4CFERft4Q_gDG0LX9Ge3tf4LZpdCsXbQyng-1639642129-0-gaNycGzNCVE)) and this does not take into account Curve liquidity

1080,"This would add a ""Claim to veCRV"" option when claiming CRV from Mintr.

Many jurisdictions, including the US, treat receipt of CRV from staking pool tokens as a taxable event (income). By allowing users to directly lock, this is avoided, and the net profitability of staking is higher for all impacted LPs. This should lead to more locked up CRV, less sell pressure on CRV, and merriment and good times for all.

This would improve quality of life for many users and should prove supporting of the CRV token price. It enables giving less money to Uncle Sam and his friends. Gas and time would be saved in the standard claim to vote-lock flow.

In terms of implementation, I think a checkbox next to the claim button is simplest, but I defer to the eng team on what aligns with their UI/UX look and feel.

title: [ARFC] Further increase GHO Borrow Rate
author: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative
created: 2023-10-05
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes a further increase in the GHO borrow rate by 50 basis points (bps), raising it from 2.5% to 3%.

## Motivation

The Aave community has previously recognized the importance of adjusting the GHO borrow rate to maintain the stability and health of the protocol. The motivations for this proposal are:

1. **Strengthening the GHO Peg**: The prior adjustment to the GHO borrow rate resulted in a stronger GHO peg. An additional increase is anticipated to further bolster the peg and get closer to the target value.
2. **Enhancing GHO Revenue**: By increasing the borrow rate, the protocol is expected to generate additional revenue from GHO borrowings.
3. **Coordinated Effort**: This proposal aligns with other initiatives, including the GHO buy program set of AIPs, as part of a coordinated effort to support the GHO peg.

The discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.

This proposal also greenlights the ACI for a `direct-to-AIP` process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate. 

## Specification

- Asset: GHO  
- Contract Address: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f  
- Current Borrow Rate: 2.5%  
- Proposed Borrow Rate: 3%  
- New discounted Borrow Rate: ~2.1%

## Disclaimer

The Aave-Chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.


## Next Steps

1. If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.

### [ARFC]  Risk Parameters for DAI Update

### Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

### Date: 2024-04-02

---

### **Summary**

This proposal aims to update the risk parameters for the DAI stablecoin across all Aave deployments.

## Motivation

MakerDAO's recent aggressive actions with their D3M program have resulted in a significant increase in the ""D3M"" credit line for DAI, growing from 0 to predicted 600 million DAI within less than a month. With the potential extension of this credit line to 1 billion DAI in the near term, the unpredictability of future governance decisions by MakerDAO raises concerns regarding the inherent risk nature of DAI as collateral.

These liquidity injections are done in a non-battle-tested protocol with a ""hands off"" risk management ethos and no safety module risk mitigation feature.

The Aave protocol had previous experience of the consequences of reckless minting policies at a much smaller scale, with Angle's AgEUR (now EURA) mint into EULER a week before their hack and jEUR minting into Midas leading to the asset long-term depeg.

Given that only a fraction of DAI deposits are currently utilized as collateral on Aave, and users have ample liquidity to switch to USDC or USDT as alternative collateral options, this proposal aims to mitigate potential risks without significantly negatively impacting our user base.

## Specification

### Proposed Changes:

### **Conservative**

**Decrease DAI and sDAI LTV by 12 Percentage Points, LT 1 Percentage Point Per 100M Deployed:**

Based on the details outlined in this [post](https://governance.aave.com/t/generalized-lt-ltv-reduction-on-aave/16766), there is a planned gradual reduction in the LTV ratios for DAI and sDAI on Aave V3, transitioning from 77% to 75%, accompanied by a decrease in the LT from 80% to 78% across most chains. Considering these anticipated adjustments and the maximum implied percentage of total DAI backing by (s)USDe at 12%, we conservatively recommend a linear reduction of an additional 12 percentage points in LTV. Regarding the LT, we suggest a conditional decrease of 1 percentage point for every 100M in D3M exposure, with a maximum reduction of 6 percentage points, assuming the full 600M is deployed. LT reductions naturally come with potentially induced liquidations, thus if the amount liquidated due to LT changes is deemed too large, we will modify accordingly. This process will begin with a 1% reduction from the current value to account for the initial 100M, once the initial expected decrease has been completed.

**Given current inconsistencies in DAI LTs across the different chains, we will aim to align the LTs and LTVs in the first stage of this proposal. This means that in instances where the LT is currently set higher, the initial reduction would be more than the 1% suggested above. This standardization will be carefully planned to minimize the impact of LT reductions on the likelihood of liquidations.**

### Specification

| Chain | Asset | Current Expected LTV | Recommended LTV | Current Expected LT | Recommended LT (1st stage) | Recommended LT (Last Stage) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V3 Ethereum | DAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |
| V3 Arbitrum | DAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |
| V3 Optimism | DAI | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |
| V3 Polygon | DAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |
| V3 Gnosis | WXDAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |
| V3 Avalanche | DAI.e | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |
| V3 Metis | m.DAI | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |
| V3 Ethereum | sDAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |
| V2 Ethereum | DAI | 75% | 63% | 87% | 77% | 72% |
| V2 Polygon | DAI | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |
| V2 Avalanche | DAI | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |

### Aggressive

**Decrease DAI and sDAI LTV to 0%, LT 1 Percentage Point Per 50M Deployed:**

Given Maker's allocation of a significant portion of potential DAI backing to a new, riskier asset, should the community wish to take more aggressive action, we propose a temporary reduction in the LTV to 0%. Regarding the LT, our recommendation is to conditionally decrease by 1 percentage point for every 50M in D3M exposure, with a maximum reduction of 12 percentage points, assuming the full 600M is deployed. LT reductions naturally come with potentially induced liquidations, thus if the amount liquidated due to LT changes is deemed too large, we will modify accordingly. This proposal prioritizes a risk-averse strategy to hedge against potential future actions by MakerDAO, considering the minimal revenues generated from collateral usage. This process will begin with a 2% reduction from the current value to account for the initial 100M.

**Given current inconsistencies in DAI LTs across the different chains, we will aim to align the LTs and LTVs in the first stage of this proposal. This means that in instances where the LT is currently set higher, the initial reduction would be more than the 2% suggested above. This standardization will be carefully planned to minimize the impact of LT reductions on the likelihood of liquidations.**

### Specification

| Chain | Asset | Current Expected LTV | Recommended LTV | Current Expected LT | Recommended LT (1st stage) | Recommended LT (Last Stage) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V3 Ethereum | DAI | 75% | 0% | 78% | 76% | 66% |
| V3 Arbitrum | DAI | 75% | 0% | 78% | 76% | 66% |
| V3 Optimism | DAI | 75% | 0% | 80% | 76% | 66% |
| V3 Polygon | DAI | 75% | 0% | 78% | 76% | 66% |

| V2 Avalanche | DAI | 75% | 0% | 80% | 76% | 66% |

# Summary

This publication proposes updating Aave DAO's stable coin holdings in preparation for the emergence of several service provider proposals. Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.

# Motivation

The below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)

The is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.

In the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:

* Security (Certora, Sigma)
* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) 
* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))
* Marketing (Aave Companies)
* Delegates (6 teams)
* Liquidity Committee (GLC)

Assuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.

The GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.

The previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:

* $375k ACI (6 months)
* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)
* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)
* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)

Total: $1,721k GHO

The DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.

This proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.

The DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).

However, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.

## Security Service Providers

Aave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.

* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)
* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)
* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)

This proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. 

For the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.

## Bug Bounty Program

The Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.

## Risk Service Providers

During 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.

Based upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.

## Voting Service Providers

The current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.

We note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.

## Financial Service Providers

A budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. 

** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**

## Marketing Service Provider

Currently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.

## GHO Liquidity Committee

The GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.

$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. 

## Growth Service Provider

The ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.

## Development Service Provider

The @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.

## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider

The AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.

## Safety Module

Expenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.

## Funding

Over the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:

* $1.5M - Security (6 months)
* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)
* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)
* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)
* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)
* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)

Total: 5.1M USD

All Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. 

Risk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.

There is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.

The ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.

An additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.

Additional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.

# Specification

This proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:

* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI
* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)
* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)

Swap the following asset holdings to GHO:

* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)
* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)
* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)
* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)
* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)

Bridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:

* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury
* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury
* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury

The USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:

* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3
* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3
* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3
* Swap 700k USDC to GHO

Upon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:

* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)
* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)
* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)
* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)

The above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. 

# Next Steps

1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

Whilst we advocate for having 12 months on runway readily available in the right asset configuration. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.

Coherently with AIP-21 Staking Process with Caps (1x drop), this AIP wishes to simplify and move forward, effectively proposing again the previous AIP-5, which was voted against uniquely for the absence of caps in the Staking Process.

This proposal presents the total ApeCoin allocation for the staking pools and the three-year duration of this staking period.

1089,"the chance to hit 6 numbers is insanely low and for the last 100 rounds no one even hit 5 numbers.

in my opinion we should remove the 6th number and spread the pot evenly in 5 numbers. this will boost the overall experience with lottery and encourage people to play.

ofcourse  a huge pot is fun to bet on but I rather have a 300K pot on 5 numbers and have a small chance to share it with someone, instead of a 100k 5 number pot and 200k on 6 numbers and no one ever hitting it. 

these are just example numbers and the 6th number pot should be spread accordingly.

this wil also boost the winnings when you just hit 1 number.",neutral

I would like to suggest a new option for people who enjoy playing the lottery. 

Like most people me as well. Miss many lottery draws due to being busy with work,  family or social obligations.  

Myself and I'm sure I could speak for many others, who love to play the lottery for the chance and excitement of winning. Would really appreciate a new feature. 

It would be really great, if there was a subscription option. Where you could buy not just multiple tickets for one draw, but could also buy tickets for multiple draws. 

For example if you like to play one ticket or more every draw you could purchase:

1 ticket or more randomly selected or picked numbers for:

10 draws,  20 draws,  30 draws, etc.... 

It would cut down on transaction gas spent to play.

It would alow for people to enter more draws more frequently burning more cake.

Users like me could then not worry about missing rounds and wondering if that was the one lol

1097,"#### ABSTRACT

On behalf of [Encode Club 3](https://www.encode.club), I’m excited to put forward this grant proposal for Apecoin to co-sponsor our upcoming four-week virtual Future of Blockchain University Hackathon. This global event aims to introduce sharp university students to leading blockchain protocols, providing the space for a four-week deep dive into the Apecoin ecosystem.

We anticipate driving greater engagement with Apecoin and promoting its adoption across an ever-expanding community. Apecoin’s involvement would include interaction with hackers during two 60-minute technical workshops and setting up to three challenges with accompanying prizes!

#### OVERALL COST

We kindly request Apecoin to sponsor our Gold-tier package, entailing a total commitment of $25,000. This sum is split between event organization, targeted marketing, hiring support, and other related costs ($12,500), and prizes to incentivise participants ($12,500).
 This carefully balanced investment in event logistics and participant motivation will help to ensure a successful, dynamic hackathon that champions innovation and brings the Apecoin community closer together.

# Summary:

Enable a Balancer gauge for the PAR/EURA (ECLP-PAR-EURA) E-CLP with a 2% cap on Ethereum.

PAR is crypto-backed Euro stablecoin issued by the Parallel Protocol.

EURA is crypto-backed Euro stablecoin issued by the Angle Protocol.

The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP). E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.

# Protocol Description:

### Parallel Protocol

The Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol) is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon and Fantom. Stablecoins (PAR & paUSD) are decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro/USD fiat currency.

### Angle Protocol

Angle is a decentralized and over-collateralized stablecoin protocol composed of smart contracts running on open blockchains. It can be used to issue stablecoins designed to maintain the value of the assets they are pegged to.

EURA (previously agEUR), pegged to the value of the Euro - €. EURA holders can stake their stablecoins for stEUR in order to earn a native € yield.

# Motivation:

The role of the PAR/EURA E-CLP pool is to increase the stability of PAR, the on-chain liquidity of both PAR and EURA, connect the Parallel and Angle ecosystems.

The capital efficiency of E-CLPs will help to quickly increase the liquidity for PAR & EURA. This hub-and-spoke network will enable a more liquid secondary market for PAR & EURA to make it easier to exit from/ enter into PAR & EURA.

By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for PAR & EURA. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:

* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.

### A few notes:

* PAR (the Parallel EURO stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Polygon: [2eur (PAR)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x513cdee00251f39de280d9e5f771a6eafebcc88e000000000000000000000a6b)
* paUSD (the Parallel USD stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Ethereum: [e-cs-kp-USD ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x01536b22ea06e4a315e3daaf05a12683ed4dc14c0000000000000000000005fc)
* Mimo Labs has started building positions in AURA (±557k $vlAURA) & BAL and the Parallel [Protocol treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b) currently holds 23k $vlAURA.
* Mimo Labs is still buying AURA which will be locked to incentivize the liquidity.
* MIMO (the Parallel governance token) already gauges on Balancer Ethereum & Polygon: [p-MIMO/WETH 80/20](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x3dbb91bdd5fc74c49146819ed58d7d204cf5a016000200000000000000000cfb) / [MIMO/WETH 80/20](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xee3959fd00a0b996d801fc34b7ce566bd037f5f500020000000000000000063e)

# Specifications:

1. Governance:

* Parallel Protocol: none on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a ⅝ multi-sig (4 team members and 4 dao members [elected](https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/governance/dao-multisig) by vMIMO holders).
  * Polygon PoS: 0x2046c0416A558C40cb112E5ebB0Ca764c3C5c32a

  * Fantom: 0x174162ddecE9d0b7B68fd945e38c3372C4C818ba
* Angle Protocol: The Angle DAO is controlled by veANGLE holders through onchain votes. Angle governance enables the community of veANGLE holders to propose, vote, and implement changes through the administrative smart contract functions of the protocol.

2. Oracles:

* Parallel: PAR uses EURUSD chainlink price feed and mainly uses Chainlink price feeds for all its collateral assets.
* Angle: agEUR uses EURUSD Chainlink price feed.

3. Audits:

* Parallel: https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/ten-x-titan
* Angle: https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits

4. Assets & Centralizing vector:

* PAR has a debt limit on each collateral, is partially collateralized by USDC (≈ 30%) and the ownership of the Parallel protocol and is held by a 5/8 multisig with 4 signers from Mimo Labs and 4 signers [elected](https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/governance/dao-multisig) by vMIMO holders.
* EURA: is overcollateralized (details [here](https://analytics.angle.money/collaterals)). The Angle DAO is controlled by veANGLE holders through onchain votes and is responsible for parameters tuning, deploying new stablecoins, accepting new collateral types for a given stablecoin, for treasury management and for protocol upgrades and integrations
5. Market history:

* PAR has been live since April 2021 (on Ethereum); PAR is soft pegged to EUR
* EURA: (previously agEUR) has kept a tight peg since its launch.

6. Value:

* The PAR/EURA E-CLP pool will act as the main route for arbitrages and the use cases mentioned above (on-chain liquidity, etc.).

**Authors: Json**

**Background**

The bug disclosure made by Balancer [last week](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1694014645378724280) resulted in many pools being “killed” (i.e. no longer eligible to receive BAL rewards), this event coincided with the end of an Aura [voting round](https://gaugevotes.aura.finance/#/proposal/0x31a728854c1e6f16589d974515a14f88750d8990a926d54e6d9db43cb8d3955f). This proposal seeks to make whole projects who placed voting incentives or votes on affected pools, to a sum of $19.6k in USDC.

This event resulted in roughly $84k worth of voting incentives/votes being placed on affected pools, which would no longer be able to be honored by Aura/Balancer. Fortunately, Balancer contributors were able to swiftly create replacement pools/gauges with non-boosted pools to provide projects an alternative place for their votes to be cast. 

**Specifications**

Of the ~$84k affected votes, the final proposed refund amount stands at $19.6k, based on the value of provided incentives at the time and thanks to many projects opting to reallocate. This proposal is to refund the following amounts in USDC to the affected projects:

Therefore, the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` would refund the specified amounts to the corresponding refund addresses. The DAO Multisig will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing `transfer` passing each address above, and their corresponding amount.

**Summary:**

> This pool contains a boosted / linear stable pool token bb-am-USD - Balancer’s AAVE boosted stable pool token & the stMATIC-bb-a-WMATIC pool token. These pools leverage the yield bearing versions of stable coins, USDC, USDT, DAI and stMATIC-WMATIC pairing in a 50/50 weighted pool. This will make a highly capital efficient route for LPs to keep exposure to stMATIC and stable coins while earning yield through AAVE. The protocol will be earning yield on the boosted portion of this pool, making the token pairing more efficient for both parties. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.

ENS (Ethereum Name Service) is an critical piece of infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem with over 400,000 names registered and hundreds of intergrations across the ecosystem.

$ENS is the governance token providing ownership over the ENS protocol. $ENS governs the direction of the ENS treasury as well as controlling crucial protocol parameters via the ENS registrar controller.

This proposal looks to onboard $ENS as a collateral asset to Aave. 

## Motivation

Following conversations with Aave and ENS core team members, we've found that ENS is a prime candidate for Aave, already having gathered over $1B in circulating market cap and millions of dollars in liquidity across the ecosystem.

The addition of ENS to Aave lending markets will unlock additional liquidity and optionality for all ENS holders.

## Benefits to Aave Community

ENS is a highly reputable multi-billion dollar protocol with a significant amount of liquidity on Ethereum. The addition of ENS will provide Aave with an increase in bandwidth and utility for the protocol.

In addition, the Aave community should be aligned with the addition of ENS token given a significant amount of the Aave community also hold ENS names (and ENS tokens as a result of the retroactive distribution).

## Summary
This publication presents the community an opportunity to add gmBTC on the Arbitrum Aave v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Motivation
GMX Protocol is the largest DEX offering derivatives and one of the most popular DeFi’s today. The introduction of several new features and integration with Chainlink Data Stream in GMX V2 has significantly reduced the risks of front-running and price manipulation compared to GMX V1. gmBTC is a BTC-USD's Liquidity Token on the GMX V2 and earn fees from leverage trading, borrowing fees and swaps. 

Integrating gmBTC as collateral asset in the Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool has the potential to create new demand for borrowable assets on Aave V3.
