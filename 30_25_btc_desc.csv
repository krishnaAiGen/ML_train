2. **veCRV holders Distribution** - Current locked supply is around 10% which could result in APY of over 250% meaning rough calculations suggest distribution to veCRV holders will likely remove selling pressure more effectively as people vote lock for their boost and receive fees.

# Summary

## Problem

Uniswap's governance treasury will retain 43% of $UNI supply vested over 4 years, currently allocated 113 million in $UNI. Current value ~ ****$2.724 Billion USD. Max drawdown starting on May 3 2021, in 20 days $UNI lost 71% of it's value, a loss of ~ **$3.616 Billion USD.**
We need to manage this systemic risk and volatility for the long term success of the community treasury. 

## Solution

Partial divestment of Uniswap governance treasury by using UMA Synthetic KPI Options to create a win for the treasury, a win for the protocol and a win for the stakeholders. Long term goal would be to put together an actively managed portfolio for the treasury aka uniHOUSE.

TVL Metric is only an example. There have been suggestions on using other metrics to measure the KPI for this option. It is currently an open issue which  we can delve into more after the temperature check.

# Background

## Yam.Finance

[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has been leading the charge on treasury management for DAOs via our project DAO House: [https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a](https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a)

We've realized that there are significant systemic risks for DAO's treasuries. During the bear market of 2017 multiple projects were forced to sell their treasury at historically low values, which ultimately caused many of them to disband and shutter. 

Treasury management is mission critical for DAOs, yet the challenges and complexities are formidable. Sushi realized this systemic issue and collaborated with [Yam.Finance](http://yam.Finance) to build a custom treasury management solution called sushiHOUSE: [https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106)

The most difficult part of a treasury management solution for a DAO as large as UNI, is the first part, the treasury protocol token divestment. I present a novel solution that will benefit the treasury, the long term success of the protocol and also all stakeholders. 

## UMA Synthetics

A quick primer on UMA: [https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works)

By using UMA's platform, we are able to use battle tested UMA financial contracts to create KPI options. Here are some examples of current KPI options that are already deployed and distributed.

[https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4)

[https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa](https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa)

# KPI Options

## How do KPI Options work?

KPI options can be created by using UMA's battle tested UMA financial contracts. 

1. Determine KPI metric for the synthetic. For example, KPI metric is Total Value Locked (TVL), currently ~$1.5b. KPI Metric could be many different things like volume, total fees generated over 30 days ect. 
2. Determine target for KPI, value and expiry date. For example, we want to target 2x TVL start, $3b and want the option to expire end of 2021.
3. Mint KPI option by depositing collateral to be used at settlement. For example, collateralize 1 $UNI token for 1 KPI option. 
4. For our example above:
    1. TVL option starts at a value of .5 $UNI because current TVL is $1.5b
    2. If TVL > $3b before the end of 2021, the TVL option can be settled for 1 $UNI after it expires at the end of 2021. 
    3. If TVL < $3b at expiry it will be worth a fraction of 1 $UNI. For example at expiry TVL is $2b, the value of the synth expires to 2/3 $UNI = .667 $UNI.
    4. Synth is unliquidatable and fully collateralized. 

## How do KPI Options divest UNI's community treasury?

From example above, KPI Option is created by:

1. Collateralizing 1 $UNI token 
2. KPI metric tracked is TVL, starting at $1.5b
3. Target is $3b TVL by the end of the year. If it reaches $3b TVL anytime before expiry  

UNI's community treasury is able to utilize its treasury full of UNI tokens to create these KPI options. 

1. KPI Options would be minted by treasury and sold for stable coins via a gnosis auction or by various other means. Implied value of the option is .5 UNI (current TVL is $1.5b with target of $3b). 
2. The sale would fund the treasury with stablecoins which could then be used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options by using Uniswap's AMM pools. 
3. At expiry all KPI options could be settled and stablecoins withdrawn from LP positions. 
4. Treasury now has stable coins = WIN!
5. UNI stake holders have incentives to increase TVL = WIN!
6. Stablecoins are the cornerstone of long term success for UNI protocol = WIN!

Win - Win - Win

# Additional Details

[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has extensive knowledge on building synthetics on UMA's platform via our development of [degenerative.finance](http://degenerative.finance), V2 of site to be launched soon. Combined with our experience in DAO treasury management, it allows us to have a unique perspective to create this proposal.

# Summary

As a recap, on 13 April 2022, a [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-incorporation-of-the-balancer-foundation/2989) was brought to the BalancerDAO (or the “DAO”) to incorporate the Balancer Foundation (or the “Foundation”). The Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work, furthering Balancer’s decentralization goals, and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.

The Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate, and provides, among others, two primary benefits:

It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts. In addition, for example, it intends to establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto.

It encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, it could engage business development or tech providers.

In short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the BalancerDAO in the structure of the traditional business world.

The Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.

Running a Foundation Company comes with certain real-world costs and financial reserve requirements. These are laid out below, first in summary and then in detail for reference.

## Specification - Foundation Expenses and reserves

This proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2022 running through March 2023, and a self-insurance reserve.

### Foundation Expenses

The summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.

The Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, so April / May /June is the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, although it is the first quarter for which funding is requested.

1. Q2 FY22 - USDC 32,941 - actual expenses incurred through the end of May 2022 and forecast for June 2022 - immediate payment requested
2. Q3 FY22 - USDC 67,919 - for transfer 25 June 2022
3. Q4 FY22 - USDC 67,969 - for transfer 25 September 2022
4. Q1 FY23 - USDC 78,384 - for transfer 15 December 2022

The table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter. Descriptions for each line item are included under the “Detail” section further below.

![|624x417.174903581549](upload://vPqyfiEv162ngVFJ64ipxJDv5Ii.jpeg)

### Foundation Self Insurance Reserve

As part of this proposal, we are asking BalancerDAO to hold the equivalent of US$500,000 as a self-insurance reserve, earmarked for a year and to be revisited after a year. The reserve can be maintained in BAL tokens given current market conditions, but must at all times be available to the Foundation should it be needed, and must be maintained at an equivalent value of US$500,000. More on this reserve requirement can be found in the “Detail” section below.

Note: the proposal is for funding at the Balancer Foundation level, it does not include funding for:

1. Balancer OpCo Limited, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) subsidiary and operating company that will house the front-end development team for BalancerDAO,
2. Other third-party service providers to the BalancerDAO, such as Orb Collective and Kolektivo Labs.

Proposals for funding these three entities will follow separately.

# Detail

For reference, please see below descriptions of the individual line items.

## Annual Secretary Fee

Under Cayman Law, a foundation company must at all times have a secretary who is a 'qualified person' (i.e. a person licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services). The secretary has a duty to ensure that the company complies with applicable Cayman Islands legislation governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.

Neither the secretary fee nor the registered office fee includes the preparation of minutes and resolutions. The Foundation will prepare these for typical matters but might seek assistance from Campbells if complex matters arise.

These fees are due in January each year.

## Registered Office and Registrar of Companies fees (via Campbells Corporate Services Cayman)

Annual registered office and registrar fee – US$2,915.12, which consists of:

- Registered Office fee of US$ 1,495.00

- Beneficial Ownership Reporting and Register Maintenance Fee of US$225.00

- Economic Substance Notification Fee of US$125.00

- Registrar Annual Return Fee of US$853.66

- Supplementary Registered Office License Fee of US$91.46

- Sundry Disbursements of US$125.00

Includes:

- providing the registered office and registered agent

- maintaining the statutory registers

- preparation and submission of annual returns

- filing economic substance notifications

- maintaining the UBO register and reporting on the same

These fees are due in January each year.

## Additional Campbells Corporate Services costs

Any legal advice that may be requested from time to time will be charged on a time spent basis. Any additional corporate requests (for example, requests for certificates, certified documents, updates to registers, filing changes, mail forward, etc – these are all in addition to the annual fees) will also be charged separately.

## Governance/Supervisory Services

### Non-Executive Director and Supervisor Responsibilities

Under the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.

“Supervisor”, for a foundation company, means a person, other than a member, who under the foundation company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.

The non-executive director responsibilities are:

* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors
* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation
* To work with the wider board of directors to:
  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;
  * set an agenda for board meetings;
  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate
* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate
* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission
* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary
* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director
* Set the tone to involve the Balancer ecosystem in developing long-range programs to support and increase all types of contributions to Balancer projects
* Set the tone to harmonize the ecosystem working with the board, the service providers, and projects and adjacent foundations to find opportunities to collaborate and reduce confusion.

### Community Board Member duties

The Directors have ultimate responsibility for the management of the Foundation. In particular, the Director’s responsibilities will include:

* complying with all reasonable requests, instructions and regulations made or given by the Board (or by any duly authorized committee thereof) and give to the Board such explanations, information, and assistance the Board may reasonably require

* attending all meetings of the Board in person or by video/phone; provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary, as applicable, with reasonable advance notice; and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances;

* bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO, strategy, policy, resources, performance, and regulatory matters;

* providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, adherence to terms set forth in the Articles;

* planning, developing, and enhancing the future strategic direction of the DAO

* sharing responsibility with the other director(s) of the Company for the effective management of the Company

### CEO/Management duties

The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Foundation, which includes the following roles:

1. Liaising with the board on all budgets, project proposals, and matters particularly as it relates to service providers including the BVI subsidiary

* Reporting to the board in a timely manner on all matters of importance including financial status, funding projections, policy setting, planning, program operations, employee matters, and the long-term health of the ecosystem.
* Providing adequate materials and analysis to assist the board in making decisions on all matters of importance.

2. Manage Finances and Service Providers

* Overseeing all financial management of the Foundation, including budgets for Board approval, grant, and funding administration required by either the Foundation or other supporters. Possessing thorough knowledge of all funding sources and required records.
* Maintaining and adapting the organizational structure and systems capable of meeting the needs of the Foundation in carrying out its mission.
* Overseeing BVI subsidiary operations including staff and logins as needed (Twitter, GitHub, Discord). Contracts with BVI for service providers.
* Setting up and administering the Foundation’s bank account
* Setting up and managing token custodian

3. Involving the board, ecosystem participants, service provider staff as needed in developing organizational goals, a strategic plan, and projections for supporting the Balancer mission through service providers (Orb Collective Inc and BVI subsidiary) and the community.

* Overseeing vendors & others involved in actively seeking software and product developments and funds as needed.
* Ensuring that the Balancer projects delegated to service providers and the ecosystem have clear objectives that are within the scope of the resources and mission of the Foundation.
* Overseeing the gathering, analysis, and reporting of data illustrating the work accomplished by service providers to manage performance and deliverables
* Reviewing program evaluation results and developing and executing strategies for continual improvement.

4. Compliance

* Responsible for all necessary filings, responses to inquiries, management of AML Compliance vendor, and other Cayman Foundation compliance and risk-related matters

5. and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation.

## Legal Counsel

The Foundation may from time to time require advice on matters of Cayman law. It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item. We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter. For clarity, this refers to the legal team rather than the corporate services team.

## Self Insurance

It is typical for an organization to obtain insurance to protect itself against the legal, regulatory and operational risks, as well as to protect the directors and officers from personal liability for carrying out their duties. We have not seen reasonable insurance for organizations of this nature in the market, hence the need to self-insure.

We are asking for $500,000 based on the costs of defending Balancer in the event of a regulatory inquiry, class action or other lawsuit or vulnerability to the ecosystem. The self-insurance is based on recent DeFi matters within the last 12 months which have cost on average $100,000 monthly to defend. It is important to note, that we have excluded any reserve for payment of damages, fines, or impact on users.

Since this is a reserve and not an expense, the Directors may assess in the future that a lower reserve amount becomes sufficient and propose changes to the DAO. We are asking that the DAO bookmarks these funds to hold for self-insurance.

## Bank Fees

The Foundation is working to establish a bank relationship that we are advised could take approximately 6-8 weeks once the application is complete and submitted. This line item is an estimate/placeholder for monthly fees

## Accounting Software

Estimate for monthly software subscription fees.

12,"Symmetric as the official friendly fork of Balancer on Celo

This proposal aims to expand the Balancer ecosystem to Celo, managed by Symmetric,and make Symmetric the official Friendly Fork of Balancer on Celo.

Background:

Symmetric is a fork of Balancer that currently runs on the Celo and Gnosis Network, and will soft launch on Kava imminently. The project launched in 2021 and has since deployed a V1 and V2 fork of Balancer on both networks in addition to graduating from Celo Camp. Symmetric has close ties to the Celo community and looks to play a large part in Celo’s mission-based activity moving forward.

Symmetric approached BalancerDAO before launching V2, which did not result in an agreement. Symmetric has since shipped and operated their V2 on Gnosis and Celo in July, while BalancerDAO introduced the veBAL tokenomics, launched on Optimism in collaboration with Beethoven, and the bLabs team added a deployment to Gnosis to their roadmap.

Based on these changes, we think it’s the right moment to re-engage and find a mutually beneficial outcome.

Motivation

The Celo Ecosystem, despite relatively low usage, is seeing an increase in interest as the ReFi space native to the chain is growing fast, with projects such as Toucan protocol moving onto Celo recently. Another example is Uniswap moving to Celo with a $10M incentive package from the Celo Foundation’s DeFi for the People initiative focusing on Green Assets. Another significant point is that PrimeDAO is launching a ReFi Launchpad program on Celo in Q4 with $1M in funds available for project launches and liquidity rewards (bribes).

We believe we have the right knowledge, skillset, and network to successfully expand the Balancer protocol onto the Celo network and become one of the top three DEXs on Celo by the end of 2023.

Specifications

Friendly Fork Status

If this vote successfully passes, the Celo deployment of Symmetric will be recognized as the official friendly fork of Balancer on Celo.

SYMM token distribution mechanism

Symmetric plans on developing a system similar to veBAL by which SYMM token distribution is optimized and decentralized through holding of SYMM’s core pool on Celo (SYMM-CUSD) and voting via a simple gauge.

Tokens to become a FF

SymmetricDAO proposes distributing SYMM tokens to BalancerDAO and Balancer Stakeholders to become a Friendly Fork. In exchange for becoming the Friendly Fork on Celo, SymmetricDAO will distribute ~2.5% (12,500 SYMM) of the tokens to BalancerDAO and ~1% (5000 SYMM) to veBAL holders that engage with the deployment by December 31, 2022.",bullish
13,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas/1437). If approved, changes would take effect at **00:00 UTC on Monday, March 8**.

On behalf of the Balancer community, I’d like to propose significant modifications to the ongoing gas reimbursement campaign. We have heard some concerns that the campaign is confusing and that it isn’t clear how much BAL a user will receive for a given trade. During these times of network congestion and high gas costs, we want to provide everyone with an opportunity to trade on Balancer. With that in mind, it doesn’t seem fair to ask users to exercise blind faith and wait until “next Wednesday” to find out what they’ve earned from trading. We would like to make every effort to simplify the campaign and improve transparency; what you see is what you get, or at least as close as possible. We plan to accomplish this by removing various sources of uncertainty from the reimbursement calculations so that it is possible to get an estimate ahead of time and display it to the user at the time of trade submission.

# The Proposal
Allocate **30,000 BAL** from the Ecosystem Fund to the “BAL for Gas'' campaign. There is no fixed time period; the budget is consumed on a **first-come, first-served** basis. When the budget is exhausted, the campaign is suspended until it is replenished by BAL governance.

For **each eligible trade made through the Balancer Exchange Proxy**, award claimable BAL tokens to the trader. An eligible trade is a trade containing one or more eligible swaps, where an eligible swap is a **swap between any two tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json)**. Claims are made available at the [BAL claims interface](https://claim.balancer.finance/#/) on Wednesday (UTC time) following the close of the weekly period (00:00 UTC Monday - 23:59 UTC Sunday) in which the trade occurred.

The amount of gas to be reimbursed is predetermined by the number of eligible swaps within the transaction:

![table|690x185](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/dd83c24ba43bd36e91396a5b6296f4c92cc986c2.png)

For converting gas to BAL, use the **median gas price of the enclosing block** and the **BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko** closest to the block time.

# Motivation
The proposal above may seem familiar, but there are some very important distinctions between this and the previous reimbursement program. All modifications share the common goal of improving user experience, which we believe is a matter of simplification and transparency.

First, this proposed campaign makes no effort to account for the _actual_ expenses of the user. Both the amount of gas consumed by the transaction and the gas price ultimately paid are irrelevant. Instead, deterministic figures are favored: the amount of gas is fixed depending on the number of swaps, and the gas price is the block median, rather than the user’s own price. It is simply too difficult to accurately predict the parameters of a given transaction ahead of time, whereas it is much easier to predict block-wide parameters. Predictability informs transparency.

The second major shift pertains to the budget. The existing program allocates a fixed weekly budget, which can sometimes necessitate cuts to the reimbursements in order to avoid excess spending. Such cuts can only be known _after_ the weekly period has ended, and therefore the existence of a weekly budget renders any trade-time estimates useless. In contrast, here we propose a fixed total budget which is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. This allows us to add reimbursement estimates to the Exchange UI at the time of the trade. If there are still funds remaining in the budget, the user will see an estimate of the amount of BAL to be awarded; and if the budget is exhausted, then the user will simply be informed as such and the estimate will be zero. When the well runs dry, BAL governors can decide whether to replenish and continue the campaign.

Third, the BAL/ETH price model is modified. Whereas the ongoing campaign uses the median price for the whole weekly period, the proposed campaign uses the price as close as possible to the actual block time. Knowing the approximate price at the time of the trade allows us to make informed estimates about the amount of BAL to be awarded.

![image|690x120](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/e00a59183e29b37e29369999caccc6035028b810.png)

Finally, the fixed amounts of gas (130k, 220k, 300k, 400k) were chosen so that only 1% of all trades, on average, would be overcompensated. This should be sufficient to prevent gaming the system for profit, but nonetheless **we reserve the right to filter out suspicious activity**. The Balancer Exchange UI will never perform more than four swaps in a single trade, which is why only four numbers are provided; any transactions containing 5+ swaps must belong to bots, whereas the target audience is end users. We simply cap the reimbursement amount at 400,000 gas; any additional eligible swaps beyond the first four will yield no further benefit.

# Mechanics
Although every effort is made to be as transparent and accurate as possible, there is still a very small amount of room for error. Here we will detail how the BAL amounts are computed both at trade time (estimated) and at dispersal time (actual).

At the time of the trade:

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **estimated** gas price for display purposes is the median from the last few blocks according to the `getGasPrice()` function from the web3 provider. This should provide a good corollary to the median of the actual trade block, which cannot be known in advance.
4. The **estimated** BAL/ETH price for display purposes is queried from the large [80/20 BAL/WETH pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x59a19d8c652fa0284f44113d0ff9aba70bd46fb4/). This acts as a real-time oracle which isn’t worth manipulating because it is only used to display an estimate and not to compute an actual award amount.
5. The user will see, in one summary number, the final result of #1-4: the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for this particular trade, assuming there are still funds left in the budget. A USD estimate is also provided for completeness, with the BAL/USD price being queried from CoinGecko’s API.

The UI changes are still being finalized, but as a mockup consider the image below.

![image2|485x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/1174949f6ce920677d9102bbf6ee0a35627776b8.png)

At dispersal time (computed by the [open source mining scripts](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts)):

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **actual** gas price is the median from the block containing the trade. We will filter out artificially low-price transactions which are sometimes included by miners and can skew the median - these are typically 0-gwei or 1-gwei transactions.
4. The **actual** BAL/ETH price is queried from the CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

It should be clear that the only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are most likely quite small: the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block, and the 80/20 BAL/WETH price may not perfectly match CoinGecko’s BAL/ETH price. All in all, the user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time, and this improved user experience should bring more traders to the campaign.

A few months ago, [this vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmUS4xSkxLCyHzJmHruLcq4rfdm8tyJoXu2dvPpNEkDn6i) was passed to allow the Liquidity Mining Committee to allocate BAL rewards for the AAVE/WETH v1 pool. The BPT from this pool is staked in the [Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module) that secures the Aave Protocol. 

## Motivation

The pool currently [contains over $500M](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81) of liquidity. Fernando has been in touch with the Aave team and they have committed to migrating the pool to Balancer v2 later this year or January at latest. As a continued show of good faith in this important partnership, we should maintain the current rate of BAL rewards (12,500 BAL per week) until January 20th, 2022. Currently our commitment to this rate of rewards is set to expire on September 20th.

> Proposal to add gauge support for a newly created qETH/ETH pool on Ethereum.

**Protocol Description:**

>Tranchess is a yield-enhancing asset tracker launched on BNB Chain in June 2021. It launched its BNB liquid staking fund in January 2022 with its own validator node and is now one of the top protocols on the BNB Chain. 

>Tranchess’ fund structure comprises one main fund, known as the QUEEN token, and two tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. QUEEN tracks the underlying asset's price and earns enhanced yield with features such as yield farming and liquid staking. QUEEN can be split evenly into two sub-tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. BISHOP is a stablecoin-like token that earns a steady yield by lending its underlying position to ROOK. ROOK is a token with a built-in leveraged position to the underlying asset without the risk of forced liquidation.

>Tranchess currently runs three asset-tracking funds: BTC, ETH and BNB on the BNB Chain, and is launching its first ETH liquid staking fund on Ethereum on Nov. 25th. qETH is the liquid-staked ETH from the Tranchess Beacon chain staking system. For the convenience of future collaboration with other Ethereum protocols, qETH is designed so that the staking rewards of staked ETH is reflected as a change in the fair value of qETH, instead of a change in the number of qETH tokens. The qETH token amount would only change if users stake/unstake additional ETH with Tranchess. The proposed pool, qETH/ETH, allows users to swap between qETH and ETH, as redemption is currently not supported on the Ethereum Beacon chain. 

**Motivation:**

> The qETH/ETH pool is the cornerstone of the Tranchess ETH liquid staking product on Ethereum. Currently, the BNB liquid staking fund of Tranchess earns a total yield between 11.2%~27.9%, a combination of Tranchess staking earning of CHESS (Tranchess governance token) and PoS staking. With the ETH liquid staking fund, Tranchess aims to provide a similar enhanced yield for users on Ethereum, and the qETH/ETH pool is an essential feature to a smooth user experience.

>A veBAL gauge incentivizes users to participate and would help quickly build up the liquidity of the pool at the beginning stage for a smoother swapping experience. The pool would naturally grow with the protocol, and we expect to facilitate the incentivization with Hidden Hand and the Balancer bribing narrative.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Tranchess’ governance token is CHESS, which users earn by staking with Tranchess platform. CHESS holders can vote on various governance items, such as the staking earning split between BISHOP and ROOK, the weekly CHESS emission split among different funds, and can collect a weekly rebate of the protocol fees. CHESS holders also vote through Tranchess’s snapshot on proposals which are discussed and raised on the [TranchessForum](https://forum.tranchess.com/).   

2. **Oracles:** Tranchess adopts Chainlink as the price oracle.

3. **Audits:** Tranchess has done multiple audits since launching as we continuously develop and improve the protocol. The most recent audit report can be found [here](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-TranchessV2.1-v1.0.pdf). Additionally, Tranchess runs a [bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/tranchess/) with Immunefi.

4. **Centralization vectors:**
The token is not upgradeable or pausable.
The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract.
Tranchess ETH liquid staking is a decentralized ETH2 liquid staking product collectively runs by the Tranchess dev team and node operators.


5. **Market History:** Link to the pool: [0xC9C5Ff67bB2Fae526aE2467C359609D6BCb4c532](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC9C5Ff67bB2Fae526aE2467C359609D6BCb4c532)

6. **Value:** The qETH/ETH pool would be the primary source of liquidity for Tranchess ETH liquid staking fund, a first stop that all Tranchess users would visit when staking with Tranchess. The pool organically grows with Tranchess ETH liquid staking volume, contributing to the Balancer community.

25,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across five (5) Aave V2 assets. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

## Specification

Our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels.

## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. 

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

title: [ARFC] sDAI Onboarding on Aave V3 Gnosis Pool
author: @marczeller - Aave-chan Initiative
date: 09-10-2023
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain Pool. With the imminent deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain and the recent deployment of sDAI, we believe this integration will further enhance the utility and liquidity of the Aave ecosystem on Gnosischain.

## Motivation

- **Aave V3 Gnosischain Deployment**: The deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain is on the horizon. As outlined in the [Gnosischain deployment ARFC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-deployment-on-gnosischain/14695), sDAI was identified as a prime collateral candidate for Aave. However, at the time of the proposal's creation, sDAI had not been deployed.
  
- **Rapid Growth of sDAI**: Since its deployment, sDAI has shown significant traction, attracting $46M in just a few days. This demonstrates the community's trust and the potential of sDAI as a collateral asset in the Aave ecosystem.
  
- **Technical & Timeframe Considerations**: We propose the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain deployment, either as part of the initial deployment or through a subsequent onboarding AIP, depending on what's most optimal from both a technical and timeframe perspective.

## Specification

- **Asset**: sDAI
- **Contract Address**: 0xaf204776c7245bF4147c2612BF6e5972Ee483701

A Price sync adapter oracle considering both wxDAI value and sDAI exchange rate will be implemented as a Price feed for this asset.

### Risk Parameters

sDAI is intended to serve as a collateral asset. Given that there's minimal value in borrowing it, we propose its onboarding solely as a collateral asset, without borrowing capabilities.

| Parameter                  | Value   |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Isolation Mode             | NO      |
| Borrowable in Isolation    | NO    |
| Stable Borrow              | NO      |
| Enable Borrow              | NO     |
| Enable Collateral          | YES     |
| Loan To Value              | 77%     |
| Liquidation Threshold      | 80%     |
| Liquidation Bonus          | 5%      |
| Reserve Factor             | 10%     |
| Liquidation Protocol Fee   | 20%     |
| Supply Cap                 | 1.5M sDAI |
| Borrow Cap                 | N/A |
| Debt Ceiling               | N/A     |
| uOptimal                   | N/A     |
| Base                       | N/A      |
| Slope1                     | N/A      |
| Slope2                     | N/A    |

## Next Steps

1. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE approved, escalate to the AIP stage.

### Paragraph Summary

LUSD is stablecoin minted directly by the protocol users by opening a Trove and depositing ETH as collateral. Loans are interest-free, with a 0.5% base initiation fee. All the contracts of the Liquity protocol are immutable, which makes LUSD the most trustless stablecoin currently available on the Ethereum mainnet.

LUSD is overcollateralized by ETH with two main mechanisms helping it keep its peg: first, LUSD can be redeemed for ETH at face value (i.e., 1 LUSD for $1 of ETH). Secondly, there is a minimal collateral ratio of 110%. Both mechanisms respectively create a price floor and ceiling through arbitrage opportunities.

Since the protocol is immutable, no additional developments are planned, yet the Liquity team is working on another project that will prove synergetic with LUSD.

LUSD’s resilience makes it a highly sought-after stablecoin for DAOs and protocols looking to diversify their treasury and users looking for cost-effective leverage on ETH. The current focus is to grow the DeFi ecosystem around LUSD to enable more diverse use cases.

This proposal aims to add LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave v2 mainnet (0% LTV). If the current proposal is met with enthusiasm, other proposals will follow suit.

### Specifications

#### AIP author status

I, TokenBrice, author of this ARC [recently joined](https://tokenbrice.xyz/joining-liquity/) the Liquity team to help with DeFi strategy.

#### Overview of the project and token

Liquity is a protocol offering cost-efficient leverage using ETH as collateral. While its base design can be described as similar to Maker/DAI, there are several key differences:

* Only ETH is accepted as collateral to maximize the protocol's trustlessness and resilience.
* There is no interest fee on Liquity. Instead, the borrowers pay a predictable initiation fee starting at 0,5% — and ramping up algorithmically when needed to protect the protocol.
* Liquidations are close to instant, and enabled by a protocol-level backstop: [the stability pool](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations), a reserve of LUSD deposited by users.
* Just like Aave, Liquity uses ChainLink as the main price feed. However there is a [fallback system](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations) in place, switching to Tellor, if the ChainLink price feed data is deemed incoherent.
* Since the contracts are immutable, there is no governance. There is still a token associated with the protocol – [LQTY](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6dea81c8171d0ba574754ef6f8b412f2ed88c54d), but it’s used for incentivization and fee-sharing purposes only.
* The minimal required collateralization ratio is lower – at 110%, increasing the capital efficiency of the protocol. This is possible thanks to the stability pool and instant liquidation mechanism which also helps maintain the peg by acting as a liquidity buffer. A failsafe mechanism, called the Recovery Mode, is triggered when the total collateralization ratio of the protocol falls below 150%. Being an exceptional measure, the Recovery Mode enforces more substantial restrictions on the Troves, such as temporary minimal collateralization of 150%, until the total collateralization ratio of the protocol recovers. So far, it was only triggered once in the early days of the protocol.

#### Positioning within Aave Ecosystem

LUSD is a stablecoin offering some genuinely unique features, the leading one being the trustlessness of the whole Liquity protocol. In that sense, LUSD is one of the most resilient stablecoin and the most decentralized. Similar to the addition of RAI on Aave, having LUSD will help Aave diversify from the current dominance of centralized stablecoins such as USDC used for borrowing.

Furthermore, as mentioned above, this proposal is the first step. Several others could follow to nurture the relationship between Aave and Liquity further:

1. Enablement of LUSD as collateral (LTV>0%)
2. Enablement of efficiency mode against selected stablecoins once v3 mainnet is live.
3. Addition of LUSD on Aave/Optimism + potential enablement as collateral + again enablement of the efficiency mode.

I believe that LUSD as a borrowable asset will be met with a strong demand: it will be the first time such a resilient stablecoin could be borrowed on Aave and the first protocol where LUSD is borrowable.

#### History of the project and its components

The Liquity protocol was launched on the 5th of April, 2021. As the code is immutable, there has been no update since then. However, the team is still actively working on the protocol' DeFi integrations, such as supporting LUSD liquidity on Curve.

Since the demand for LUSD is directly dependent on the appetite for leverage on ETH, the LUSD supply had varied quite a bit since the launch, with the highest point around 1.5B LUSD when ETH reached a peak price of ~$4K. The following correction on ETH, with the lowest point around $2K, led to a drastic reduction in the LUSD supply – this episode is the first and so far unique time when the Recovery Mode was triggered. Since this episode, the supply has stabilized more and is now around 325M LUSD. This episode was the first massive stress test for the Liquity Protocol, which handled it gracefully – a recap is available here:

Since the protocol launch, various DeFi integrations have been built on top of the Liquity Protocol, here are some of the most notable:

* A Curve pool (+integration on Convex and Yearn) was created against the 3Pool and became the main liquidity source. It’s amongst the stablecoin pools with the highest base APR due to the trading volume it processes.
* DeFiSaver offers some automation features to streamline Troves management.
* B.Protocol delivered an auto-compounder for depositors of the Stability Pool who wish to keep a 100% LUSD exposure: https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity
* Some protocols, such as Olympus or Fei Protocol diversified part of their treasury to LUSD to shield themselves from volatility with an unstoppable stablecoin. Synthetix is also using LUSD on Optimism to stabilize the sUSD price.

#### LUSD usage

A sizeable share of the LUSD supply (~66%) is deposited into the Stability Pool, the liquidity backstop for liquidations: https://etherscan.io/address/0x66017d22b0f8556afdd19fc67041899eb65a21bb

The top LUSD holders also include other protocols, such as Olympus, DXdao or some treasuries.

LUSD is also present on Optimism, where Synthetix provided a wrapper contract to help stabilize the sUSD price (~45M LUSD) + to provide liquidity on Velodrome (the pool is ~9M TVL, against USDC).

#### LUSD Emission

The only way to mint LUSD is to open a Trove, while LUSD is burned through debt repayment, either directly (by the trove owner) or through redemptions (by an arbitrageur).

#### Token & Protocol Permissions

The LUSD token as well as the whole Liquity protocol are fully permissionless. There is no multisig and no governance, and no-one can interact with the contract underlying the protocol in an administrative manner: all users are the same in front of the contract, just like with Uniswap v2 for instance.

#### Market Data

As of June 03, the total LUSD supply is around 325M. There is about $90M of total liquidity in pools where LUSD is involved.

The main liquidity source for LUSD is the Curve pool with ~$65M TVL: https://curve.fi/lusd

There are also liquidity sources against FRAX, USDC and DAI on Uniswap V3: https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0

There is a 4-tokens pool on Saddle Finance (alUSD, FEI, FRAX, LUSD) with $25M liquidity: https://saddle.exchange/#/pools/D4/deposit

Finally, on Optimism, LUSD is the largest stablecoin pool with around ~$9M against USDC https://app.velodrome.finance/liquidity/0x207addb05c548f262219f6bfc6e11c02d0f7fdbe

The observed volume can vary depending on the market's activity (massive ETH price movements are usually followed by days with large volume), with a baseline around $3M daily volume (mainnet only).

#### Social channel data

The main channel for the community to gather is the Liquity Discord server, with around 6.5K members. For outward-facing communications, the main channel used is the @LiquityProtocol Twitter account with over 28.5K followers. We also regularly publish newsletter updates to subscribers (2.5K) and have recently become more active on LinkedIn (<1K).

#### Contract Related Information

Deployment of the LUSD contract - 05 April 2021: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x85cc9a6626ed080c909f768036c80bd02455c5dbd32a03aa1f16ba9575227599

Number of transactions on LUSD: 197,461 (+ ~2000 on Optimism)

Number of token holders on LUSD: 4758 (+ ~100 on Optimism)

### Risk Assessment

We followed [Aave's risk assessment methodology](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/methodology) to provide all the necessary metrics:

I'm not sure what the proper rating is for a stablecoin with no governance and immutable code should be when it comes to the ""Permission"" category, so I went with an A to reflect that in that regard, LUSD is almost as safe as ETH. Feel free to challenge me if you think that is not appropriate.

28,"*Polls and feedback were focused on the PancakeSquad community, but the ""Make Offer"" Button will be beneficial for all NFTs on the PancakeSwap NFT Marketplace.

3 reasons for to implement the ""Make Offer"" Button

(1) It's what the community wants.  A recent poll on Pancake Squad BSC Telegram Group and PancakeSquadBSC Twitter both show an overwhelming support for the ""Make Offer"" Button.  There are many times that there is a NFT that we would like to buy, but the seller has not listed it for sale or put an unrealistic sale price and there is no direct way to communicate between the seller and buyer.

(2) PancakeSquad sales will increase which will burn more $Cake.  Enabling the community to make offers and having more options and activity in the Marketplace will naturally lead to more sales.

(3) PancakeSquad Floor Price and overall Prices will increase which will burn more $Cake.  Compared to other top NFT projects, the number of PancakeSquads listed for sale in the marketplace is extremely high.  We are over 20% while other projects are all under 10%.  From the data we have been collecting, when the Squads listed for sale dropped from 25% to 24%, there was corresponding increase in the floor price from 3.6 BNB to 4.6 BNB.  The best way to get Squads off the Marketplace is to have an offer button.  The community will ""Delist"" their squads becuase the ""Make Offer"" button will still make it available and open to offers.",neutral

30,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes APX Finance ($ALP) to Syrup Pool on opBNB!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re excited to announce a new Syrup Pool with APX Finance, the partner for PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2!

APX Finance is a decentralized derivatives exchange that designed the Permissionless DEX Engine, which powers PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on BNB Chain and Arbitrum.

For an update on how the product has performed thus far, please refer to the section **“Performance of Perpetuals v2 on Arbitrum”** below.

#### The Syrup Pool on opBNB:

Stake ALP tokens to earn CAKE tokens!


Syrup Pool on opBNB:
  - **Total Tokens:** ~11,250 CAKE + 427,500 APX (converted into CAKE)
 - **Distribution duration:** 45 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1000 UTC on 20 Dec 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1000 UTC on 4 Feb 2024
 - **Token rewards per second:**  CAKE (will depend on final CAKE amount)


The CAKE tokens used to fund these Syrup Pools will be provided by PancakeSwap and APX Finance equally. The final CAKE amount will depend on token prices at time of conversion.

On PancakeSwap’s side, the CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from the Syrup Pool will encourage more users to participate in PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on opBNB, increasing liquidity, which will ultimately lead to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

There will be no cap on how much CAKE a user can stake in the Syrup Pool. This is to encourage as much on-chain ALP liquidity as possible.

#### Performance of Perpetuals v2 on Arbitrum

Since the launch on 28 Aug 2023, PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on Arbitrum has achieved impressive results, surpassing $1 billion in cumulative trading volume and attracting over 1000 users., With the support of liquidity attracted through syrup pools, our platform has consistently secured a prominent position among the leading derivatives protocols on Arbitrum in volume.

| Image taken from our [**Dune dashboard**](https://dune.com/apollox/alp-v2-arb) |

Our previous Syrup Pool proposal successfully incentivized liquidity provision, which is crucial for facilitating trading on the perpetuals platform. We have currently attained more than $2 million in liquidity value of minted ALP tokens, of which ~$1.5 million are staked in our Syrup Pool.

[During the period of incentivisation, how much CAKE was spent on the ALP pool? How much CAKE was burnt instead? This will allow your community to understand the value-for-money]

Our goal is to establish a dominant position in the derivatives category on opBNB. This proposal seeks to kickstart liquidity provision in the ALP Pool to facilitate trading for the perpetuals platform on opBNB.

#### What is Perpetuals Trading?

**Disclaimer: This information presented in this proposal does not constitute any form of financial advice or recommendation, please do your own research before making any investment decisions.**

Perpetuals, perpetual swaps, or perps are a special type of futures contract without an expiration date.

Futures trading allows users to enter positions on margin (leverage) using borrowed funds to optimize capital. Using leverage allows a user to enter a position with a size that is larger than their account balance. For example, using 10x leverage, a user could trade 100 CAKE for the price of 10 CAKE. In this example, the initial margin would be 10 CAKE which is used to collateralize the leveraged position.

In PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2, we've streamlined our interface by removing the order book and market depth displays. Instead, our partner APX Finance has introduced the ALP pool, which now provides liquidity for all trading pairs, maximizing your capital usage. The ALP pool will actively participate in the market-making process for our V2 perpetual contracts. 

More information can be found in the documentation pages of [**APX Finance**](https://apollox-finance.gitbook.io/apollox-finance/welcome/trading-on-v2) and [**PancakeSwap**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/perpetual-trading/perpetual-trading-v2).


#### What is $ALP?

From the team: “ALP is APX Finance’s liquidity provider token made up of a pool of assets (USDC, USDT, DAI, ETH, BTC). Users can become liquidity providers by using any of the specified assets to buy ALP. ***ALP pool is the direct counterparty of V2 on-chain perp traders.***

The initial issue price of ALP is USD$1. The price of ALP is influenced by the profit or loss of the pool and income from trading fees, funding fees and liquidations.

In the future, APX Finance plans to support more utility of ALP on the platform such as earning transaction fee rewards, using ALP as margin for perpetuals trading, and participation in DAO governance and voting.

34,"**Summary:**
FIAT DAO is seeking the preliminary approval of veBAL gauges for two yet-to-be-deployed stableswap pools.

- **FIAT-USDC-DAI**
- **FIAT-FEI-FRAX**

This comes after the successful migration of our governance token $FDT’s liquidity to the Balancer platform over the past month.

**References/Useful links:**

- **[App](https://app.fiatdao.com)**
- **[Docs](https://docs.fiatdao.com)**
- **[Dune](https://dune.com/1ab/FIAT)**
- **[Github](https://github.com/fiatdao)**
- **[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/fiatdao)**

**Protocol Description:**
The FIAT protocol is a DeFi-native repo market solution for providing liquidity to holders of fixed income assets. It allows users of apps like Element Finance, Notional Finance, and Yield Protocol to bring their proofs of liquidity to the protocol in order to collateralize a debt position in $FIAT, a stable value asset. Our v1 has just launched, and it’ll look and feel familiar for users who have previously minted DAI, RAI, or MIM. By utilizing proven stablecoin mechanisms, the protocol is able to offer competitive borrowing power to holders of such collateral assets, allowing them to releverage fixed yields or meet current liabilities as the locked assets mature. You can learn more about its primary use case via [this thread](https://twitter.com/wjvill/status/1527680960866705408) from Element founder Will Villanueva.

**The success of FIAT is predicated on its ability to attract secondary liquidity.** In its current iteration, it is pooling secondary liquidity around a singular asset, drawing forward demand for an otherwise fragmented universe of collateral backing. Unique to FIAT versus other CDP implementations is that fixed term collateral forces users to repay back their debt at a known point in time, lest they bear negative yields due to FIAT interest accrual on those positions thereafter - this allows for higher maximum LTVs and potentially more trading fees for LPs. Currently, only stablecoin-denominated collateral is supported by the protocol, so any risk premium is a function of smart contract concerns or changes in prevailing yields.

**Motivation:**
Over the course of its first month in existence, $FIAT has had its liquidity subsidized on Curve via a discretionary budget. Over the same time, liquidity for our governance token has been ported to Balancer. We’ve been very pleased with the migration and think it makes sense to follow suit with $FIAT here in its early days.

A number of items excite us about the opportunity:

- The presence of boosted staBAL and now FEI-FRAX-DAI pools will allow for user pathways that involve depositing into either, minting FIAT, and selling FIAT for more of the underlying in order to gain levered fixed exposure. **This results in locked TVL for Balancer and higher trading fees for Balancer LPs.**

- With Hidden Hand, it will become possible to have a larger consortium of projects actively subsidize FIAT LPs. We anticipate that all of our collateral partners with associated ERC-20 tokens will see the value in deeper FIAT liquidity for their protocols. And for other stableswap pools that exist on Balancer, deeper FIAT liquidity increases the odds of locked TVL in their pools.

- The user experience associated with veBAL and Hidden Hand is more clear than our current Curve → Rari Fuse flow.

**What we would like to discuss in this thread, however, is the deployment of the stableswap pools themselves.** Given the nature of FIAT (i.e. CDP architecture, stablecoin backing, audited collateral issuers), we would be interested to hear what members of the Balancer DAO have to say regarding their comfort with varying levels of potential [A coefficients](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/math/stable-math). If you have any specific thoughts regarding this topic, please share your opinion in the thread!

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** FIAT DAO is a completely on-chain organization, with no corresponding real world entity in place. The FDT token has been given away for free since November of 2021, and a DAO smart contract architecture has been live since December 2021.

2. **Oracles:** $FDT is a standard ERC-20 DeFi governance token that comes with the volatility inherent to the sector. $FIAT is a DAI-like asset that will come to be backed by less liquid derivatives, but at the moment only supports collateral types with existing secondary markets.

3. **Audits:** Audits of our protocol and our collateral oracle system can be found in the [Security](https://github.com/fiatdao/security) repo within our Github.

4. **Centralization Vectors:** $FDT holders determine which assets are supported as collateral and the parameters associated with each. A six of eleven guardian multisig currently holds certain emergency privileges.

5. **Market History:** $FIAT has been transferable since April 2022. It previously reached a high watermark of $1.3M deposited on Curve.

We would like to take this to a vote now that the FUD pool is live.

![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/f3247dda57bba19f253098e52d69c61a9ba9a762.png)

This proposal aims to establish a dominant presence for ApeCoin and ApeCoin DAO at the Non Fungible Conference (NFC) in Portugal, scheduled for May 28-29th, along with the wrap-up event on May 30th.

Planning involves securing a 20m² furnished networking lounge situated in a premium area of the conference. This lounge will include an interactive play-zone featuring stand-up arcade games designed to capture conference-attendee interest and generate opportunities to segue into ApeChain talks. The booth will also feature a large digital monitor playing ApeCoin-focused content, and a branded wall.

The conference’s primary WiFi network accessible for guests and other sponsors will be named ApeCoin. Attendee wristbands and staff t-shirts will display ApeCoin branding, and ApeCoin will be featured on various banners and screens during [Agoria’s](https://www.instagram.com/agoria/) final set of the opening night party, held at the event venue.

Two on-stage panels are being organized each with up to four speakers and a moderator. One discussion will focus on ApeChain, prioritizing members of the Special Council, Horizen Labs, and Layer Zero, while the other will cover ApeCoin DAO Working Groups.

ApeCoin will be announced as co-organizers alongside The Sandbox for the May 30th boat and beach wrap-up parties. The beach event will also serve as a pre-party for the [Moga Music Festival](https://www.instagram.com/mogafestival/) expected to draw between 10-12,000 jet-setters.

We will receive forty general access event tickets, access for forty general access allowlist spots, forty special-access boat tickets, and entry for up to forty people in the special-access area of the wrap-up event. Tickets will be distributed to community members in-person, and we will incentivize new Discourse signups with small amounts of APE.

The proposal also seeks approval to use the ApeCoin logo, and Powered by ApeCoin trademarks to be used for conference and wrap-up event marketing and physical conference-related branding. Provisions for promotional items include, but are not limited to, t-shirts, stickers, and educational materials have also been made. Any inventory produced under this allowance will be exclusive to conference attendees, on-stage panelists, and booth operators [not for sale].

Other conference features include a gaming startup competition with panelists Sebastien Borget (CEO Sandbox) and Robby Young (CEO Animoca Brands) helping judge, an AI Film and Fashion Festival, and a first-of-its-kind “Memecon” presented by OSF Rekt.

NFC speakers include Claire Silver, Punk6529, Deekay Motion, and John Knopf.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Participating in the NFC Conference offers ApeCoin, ApeChain, and the DAOs Working Group a prime opportunity for increased brand awareness and media exposure with over 200 Web3 speakers expected to attend.

Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of this plan compared to other events allows us to establish ApeCoin and ApeCoin DAO as one of the two dominant brand’s at the conference, alongside The Sandbox. Furthermore, Lisbon is known for its affordability in Western Europe, which helps business operations and travel.

Securing a 20m² area in a premium location with games and seating will enhance ApeCoin’s credibility, providing real-world exposure as a leading brand in the space. The conference also offers valuable networking and onboarding opportunities for ApeChain, serving as a platform for education regarding opportunities provided by the DAO.

##### OVERALL COST 
The proposal is requesting $155,000.00 USD denominated in APE with the full amount of funding required for conference and wrap-up sponsorship being provided in APE to the event.

If platinum-level sponsorships are unavailable when funding is provided, we will secure a gold-level booth in its place. Any difference in funding will either be not accepted or returned to the APE Foundation.

Title: [ARFC] Add UNI to Ethereum v3
Author: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@matthewgraham), ACI (@MarcZeller) and 3SE
Dated: 2023-02-18

---

# Summary

This proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard UNI to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

# Abstract

The UNI token is the governance token of the Uniswap ecosystem and is a DeFi bluechip. UNI was one of the first governance tokens to be integrated into the Aave ecosystem when it was listed on v1 and was included on Aave v2 when it was launched in December 2020.

This ARFC is a joint effort with ACI and 3SE to allow a selection of v2 listed assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Subject to a favourable Snapshot vote, Llama will submit an AIP for voting.

# Motivation

Uniswap is a DEX with $4.18B in TVL, second only to Curve Finance with $5.06B, according to Defi Llama’s data. Uniswap is deployed on five networks. UNI provides Aave v2 with $15.86m of TVL. Something to note, it is possible with Aave v3 to delegate Aave’s UNI reserve holding governance influence to an address which can be used for voting on Uniswap proposals.

The risk parameters provided here within are from Gauntlet’s original Aave v3 initial [assets listings and configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) forum thread. These parameters are to be revised by Gauntlet and feedback will be incorporated before progressing to a Snapshot vote.

The interest rate provided in the proposal mirrors the v2 deployment with exception of the parameters specific to stable interest rates. The stable rates proposed are the somewhat generic listing rates as stable borrowing is disabled. However, if stable borrowing was enabled, the suggested parameters are suitable and don’t create any undesirable dynamics between stable and variable rates.

We note that this proposal is to be reviewed by Gauntlet, with feedback to be incorporated, prior to progressing to Snapshot.

37,"The Venus community is publishing this Snapshot Vote in response to the (Venus Request for Comments) proposal submitted on the Venus forum several weeks ago. 

Rationale

We propose the cross-chain deployment of Venus Protocol to Arbitrum One. Arbitrum One is the leading Layer 2 most in line with Vitalik’s vision of a rollup-centric roadmap. The ecosystem has seen successful cross-chain deployment of projects such as Wombat Exchange, DODO, Gains Network, and Lyra, We look forward to the opportunity to welcome Venus Finance to its ecosystem.

Summary

Arbitrum is the leading optimist roll-up solution from a TVL perspective 1, number of live dApps 2, gas efficiency, and computational capacity with the Nitro upgrade. Arbitrum One currently has over $6B TVL, 1000+ dApp integrations, 9.7M+ unique addresses, and occupies 60%+ of the roll-up market share. As Venus Finance continues its 2023 product roadmap development, we believe that deploying on Arbitrum can offer a number of benefits.

Staked ethereum expansion has been a strategy for the Balancer protocol due to the yield bearing benefits and supporting as many ""flavors"" of staked ETH as possible is the logical step. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.

**Protocol Description:**

> cbETH is a Coinbase's staked ETH token, wstETH is a wrapped staked ETH token for Lido.

**Motivation:**

> Balancer is clearly pushing forward on all networks with staked assets as a key focus. By diversifying the staked assets Balancer opens up the door to liquidity providers to gain exposure to multiple providers, while facilitating trade routes for these assets. The protocol benefits greatly from yield bearing assets, and Balancer’s users do just as much. This pool will be a unique and diverse group of Ethereum assets making it exciting for everyone involved.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** [cbETH](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth/whitepaper) whitepaper linked as governance is not applicapable, [wstETH](https://research.lido.fi/).
2. **Oracles:** See each rate provider contract linked here respectively [cbETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7311e4bb8a72e7b300c5b8bde4de6cdaa822a5b1#code) , [wstETH ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768), 
3. **Audits:** See [cbETH](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/coinbase-liquid-staking-token-audit/) , [wstETH](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits).
4. **Centralization vectors:** cbETH is from Coinbase and therefore inherently has centralization risks, read the custodial risk section of the whitepaper [here](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth/whitepaper). For Lido and wstETH please read [here ](https://lido.fi/faq). 
5. **Market History:** See [cbETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/coinbase-wrapped-staked-eth) , [wstETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth)
6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on all assets in the pool and so will LPs. The BIP-19 flywheel will incentivize TVL to grow here with trading volume and our staked ethereum pillars will continue to have Balancer as their ideal liquidity destination.

title: ARC - Strategic Partnership with Balancer Part #2
status: Discussion
author: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham
created: 03-05-2022

# Simple Summary

Acquire 100,000 BAL tokens by deploying a Bonding Curve contract. The BAL tokens are to be held in the Reserve Factor until further details relating to Aura emerges and then the Aave community can determine if to deploy BAL to receive veBAL or auraBAL, [1].

# Abstract

Deploy a Bonding Curve to acquire an additional 100,000 BAL tokens on market at the chainlink oracle price +50 bps, for a cost $1,708,500 assuming a BAL price of $17. This is an additional purchase to the 200,000 BAL token swap being considered.

Aave will become one of eight token holders with 300,000 BAL tokens. All 100,000 BAL tokens are to be retained in the Reserve Factor until such time as further information on auraBAL emerges.

# Motivation

The original motivation for performing a token swap with Balancer can be found on the ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token, [2].

With the additional 100,000 BAL acquisition, Aave would transition from just outside the Top 50 BAL holder to inside the Top 30 holders, [3]. If an additional 75,000 BAL was acquired, totalling 375,000 BAL, then Aave would become a Top 20 holder and this includes three community wallets, one Polygon bridge pool and the main BAL liquidity pool. So really it would be more like the Top 15 holders if another 75,000 BAL was acquired.

With 300,000 BAL tokens, Aave would have the largest BAL holding of any strategic partner Balancer has partnered with. The largest strategic partnership holding to date is the 270,000 BAL position held by Tribe DAO, [4,5]. Having a larger BAL holding relative to Tribe DAO may become a competitive advantage as Tribe DAO seeks to direct TVL to Rari Fuse pools with the use of the new ERC-4626 vault, [6].

With the emergence of ERC-4626, a new type of vault, whereby Liquidity Providers (LP) can deposit their stakes BPT tokens into lending pools and earn BAL rewards whilst using staked BPT as collateral, [7]. This is particularly appealing for staked BPT holdings which have minimal Impermanent loss risk. An example would be to use the staked BPT token for the stable coin Balancer Boosted Pool which uses Aave V2 to generate yield and receives BAL rewards, [8]. Based upon the success of wstETH being listed on Aave V2, this may lead to significant Total Value Locked (TVL) growth for Aave which makes up more than 13% of Aave’s mainnet V2 market TVL, [9].

Having not yet entered in the Curve / Convex tokenomics play, Aave has an opportunity to be an early leader in the veBAL wars. With the emergence of Aura, the Aave community has a choice to determine if the 100,000 BAL to be acquired are to be deployed for veBAL or auraBAL. If Aura is like Convex, then being early and building an Aura holding is worth considering. The first step in both strategies is to acquire a sizable BAL position and as the initial 200,000 BAL is proposed to be deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year, the 100,000 BAL detailed within this proposal can be deployed into either veBAL or auraBAL contracts.

There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using either veBAL or auraBAL to vote for BAL rewards towards pools that create TVL for Aave is a strategic advantage. If Aura evolves like Convex did, then the voter locked AURA token will have more voting influence over BAL rewards than one veBAL token. Being prepared and ready for the Aura token launch is going to position Aave to maximise the upside from its investments as rewards often favour early movers.

# Implementation

A Bonding Curve deployment utilising Chainlink’s BAL/USD oracle feed with a 50 bps incentive for arbitrage trades to acquire BAL on market and deposit into the contract. Aave will provide USDC to fund the Bonding Curve contract. An example of this type of transaction occurred when Tribe purchased $10M of DPI on market, [10].

The 50 bps fee is to provide an economic incentive for arbitrage traders to attain BAL on market and deposit BAL into the contract profitably by more than offsetting gas costs. This mechanism enables everyone within defi to participate and essentially crowdsources the BAL tokens on Aave’s behalf. Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor.

46,"Greetings from Italy!

I suggest introducing a game challenge similar to UNO, which will not only entertain users but also provide an opportunity to earn rewards and utilize the native token, Cake.

1. PRIZE POOL

Each participating user would “lock” a predetermined amount set by the PancakeSwap team, such as 10 Cake, as an entry fee to join the game challenge. 
These “locked” tokens would contribute to the prize pool for the challenge.

2. TOKEN BURN

For every user participating in the game challenge, 1 Cake would be burned. 

This token burn mechanism helps maintain the scarcity of Cake and adds an element of risk to the game.

3. PRIZE DISTRIBUTION

At the end of the challenge, the remaining Cake tokens from the prize pool would be awarded to the first-place winner.

The winner can also choose to get back his inital entry and burn the remaining cakes!!

4. NFT, SKINS, BATTLE ANTHEMS

To make the game even more engaging, users can utilize their Cake tokens to purchase special skins and back designs for the game cards. These customizable options would allow users to personalize their game experience while also adding value to the Cake token.

Have a nice day!",neutral
47,"This proposal is also on [Balancer's Forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-sourcecred-engagement-incentives/684) but has undergone minor edits to include the results of forum polls.

🔥_ 🔥 ([Fire Eyes DAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao/hello-world-e3c9a409ea49)) has been working with the Balancer team to develop governance mechanisms that complement the launch of Balancer V2.

At the end of 2020, we proposed [Governance Mining](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-governance-mining/554) to encourage community members and liquidity providers to participate in governance, and to compensate these people for doing so.

One piece to this incentive program is the implementation of a [SourceCred instance](https://balancer-labs.github.io/balancer-cred/#/explorer) to track contributions to the Balancer Community.

**This proposal looks to leverage SourceCred to distribute 50 BAL per week based on the Cred and Grain scores accumulated by users across both the [Balancer Forum](https://forum.balancer.finance) and the #governance channel in the [Balancer Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7hWw6Us).**

Community members will need to opt-in to this program to be eligible for rewards, with specifics on the process to be finalized pending acceptance of this proposal.

# Motivation
The introduction of ‘soft’ incentives around governance in [Maker](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-sourcecred-trial/2551) and [Index Coop](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/the-index-flywheel/447) have improved the quantity, quality and diversity of contributions.

We aim to empower these contributions in the Balancer ecosystem via a suite of governance incentive programs. The [GovFactor](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-govfactor/589) addresses the incentivisation of liquidity provider participation, and we believe that there is a much broader space for participation in the Balancer community from people and groups who may not have the capital to become LPs, or who otherwise choose not to do so.

# Specification
The [Balancer SourceCred Instance](https://balancer-labs.github.io/balancer-cred/#/explorer) was set up in December 2020 and has been collecting contribution data for the past ~4 weeks.

We propose that BAL tokens are distributed to contributors based on the Cred scores recorded by SourceCred and the subsequent grain (or BAL) scores earned among active participants. For more on how this works, please see [this documentation](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/grain/).

The following specification details our proposed structure for these incentives. Inspiration for the allocations and configuration of this instance were modeled after the [MakerDAO SourceCred Trial](https://makerdao.sourcecred.io/#/explorer).

**Forum Incentives**
The Balancer governance forum is the home to the most important discussions and Balancer Improvement Proposals (BIPs).

This program looks to offer a fixed amount of BAL per month to those contributing in meaningful ways, measured using [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) to track aggregate likes, posts and engagement across all topics.

Balancer’s SourceCred instance is heavily weighted towards the amount of likes received across all posts, rather than the quantity of replies. This enforces a **‘quality over quantity’** approach, rewarding contributions that are deemed valuable by the community through engagement and signal.

**Discord Incentives**
We’ve noticed community members on Discord play an active role in educating new users as well as providing valuable feedback and discussion around protocol governance. Through this integration, we want to create mechanisms for those actions to be easily validated and rewarded.

The first instance of Discord incentives will track activity in the [#governance channel](https://discord.com/invite/7hWw6Us), rewarding participants for meaningful contributions in the same way as forum activity - focused on reactions as opposed to post volume to push towards a ‘quality over quantity approach’.

This program looks to serve as an ongoing medium for community members to be better rewarded for their discussion in Discord, with ambitions to boost the importance of BAL emojis and token-based roles using tools like [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/).

**Funding**
The proposed funding for SourceCred incentives is 50 BAL per week to start.

Please note that this program aims to ramp up in the event that it is successful, and we believe that starting with smaller allocations and building up as time goes on is the best way to approach these incentives.

**SourceCred has an opt-in revenue model of allocating 5% of all BAL tokens distributed through this program back to their community, and we are very much in favor of supporting this intiative.**

# Drawbacks
Some points to consider around the introduction of SourceCred incentives for contributions to the Balancer Forum:

* There is potential for this program to be exploited using bots or through collusion between actors.  We will be monitoring the rewards distributed by the instance and will take action if malicious activity occurs.",neutral

Abstract:

PR available for review. This is an adaptation of the y pool template to accommodate compound style c-tokens. This same format can be used for compound, cream, yearn, etc.

Motivation:

More pools allow for deeper liquidity, better trades, and greater arbitrage between pools. cy*tokens are currently idle DAI, USDC, USDT (and sUSD) that can be used for further trade depth, volume, and liquidity.

51,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BSC etc.

title: [ARFC] Add LUSD to Optimism V3 Market

Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative

Dated: 2023-01-31

- --

# **Summary**

This proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard LUSD to the Ethereum v3 Optimism Liquidity Pool.

# **Abstract**

LUSD is a decentralized stablecoin minted by the Liquity protocol. For more details about LUSD please refers to [Aave V3 ARC by ACI](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-lusd-to-ethereum-v3-market/11522).

# **Motivation**

Supporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform. The risk parameters provided are the same as those adopted on the ETH V3 pool.

The newly proposed risk parameters replicating the LUSD parameters on L1 are merely suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI is inviting Risk Service Providers to provide feedback on them.

LUSD is a growing stablecoin within the Optimism ecosystem, with liquidity mainly located in Velodrome Stableswap pools.

55,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-balancer-labs-to-emergency-pause/2399).

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable a multisig controlled by Balancer Labs team members to control the Boosted Pools emergency pause mechanism during its first 3 months.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) have an emergency pause period which is **hardcoded at 3 months** from the time the factories were deployed. During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. **Funds can always be withdrawn by users** , even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.

Since gathering 6/11 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also **authorizing a Balancer Labs controlled multisig to pause the system** . The [BLabs Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B) will be controlled by a handful of team members at Balancer Labs. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Governance Multisig nor the BLabs Multisig will have any pause power.

An important distinction between the pause mechanism in Boosted Pools and that of previous pool types and of the vault is that Boosted Pools are not supposed to be unpaused. In practice, after a pool is paused users should withdraw assets from the pool and a new pool should be deployed. In the event that the pause mechanism must be triggered, Balancer Labs will commit resources to draw attention from liquidity providers to the fact that they must withdraw their funds.

## Specification

The Balancer governance multisig on Ethereum Mainnet ( `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` ) would submit a transaction to the Authorizer ( `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` ) in order to grant the following roles to a Multisig controlled by Balancer Labs ( `0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B` ):

1. the ability to call the `setPaused` function on pools deployed from the `AaveLinearPool` factory ( `0xD7FAD3bd59D6477cbe1BE7f646F7f1BA25b230f8` )
2. the ability to call the `setPaused` function on pools deployed from the `StablePhantomPool` factory ( `0xb08E16cFc07C684dAA2f93C70323BAdb2A6CBFd2` )

### [ARFC-Addendum]  Update Boosters & diluters for Merit Round 2

### Author:  @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

### Date: 2024-04-03

---

### **Simple Summary**

This ARFC-Addendum proposes to make booster & diluters evolve inside Merit to adapt to the DeFi ecosystem landscape evolution, introducing new diluters & removing a booster action.

## Motivation

Merit wETH has been a clear success with nearly 200k ETH, leaving other protocols to join Aave V3. 160k ETH specifically left Morpho V3 to join aave, forcing a re-balance, and has made Morpho the second largest borrower & fee payer (>11%) of wETH in Aave, forcing them to pay north of 1600 ETH to the aave DAO per year.

https://etherscan.io/token/0xeA51d7853EEFb32b6ee06b1C12E6dcCA88Be0fFE#balances

Merit GHO has also been a success and reinforced our Safety module (17M$), secondary liquidity, and peg. It allows the DAO to restart GHO minting while keeping the peg in check.

GHO is expected to provide 10% of all DAO overall revenue by next week.

However, we have to witness less collaborative behavior from some ecosystem actors. In light of this, it seems suboptimal for the Aave DAO to reward uncollaborative protocols & behaviors.

This is why we suggest stopping any subsidies to the makerDAO ecosystem; the Aave DAO has already paid millions via the AAVE and third-party LM programs and has been repaid by creating competitive forks and activating D3M in a protocol that has stolen millions of revenue from this DAO with no safety track record using a market sensible collateral.

With this proposal, a single $ in Morpho Blue or Spark will nullify any Merit Airdrop for the user.
sDAI is considered a makerDAO product, not a Spark product; holding simply sDAI or having it in Aave will not dilute a user.

This proposal aims to be enabled for Merit Round 2 and all subsequent rounds.

## Specification

### Proposed Changes:

### Conservative Option

1. Remove ""MakerDAO fren"" Boosters. for the usage of sDAI as collateral

title: ARC: Extend the Safety Module Protection to Aave V2 Avalanche
status: WIP
author: Governance House, @MatthewGraham @ncitron, 3SE Holding & uhom 
created: 25/07/2022

---

# Simple Summary

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module (SM) protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested.

# Abstract

The Safety Module is a $700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users. It’s a unique mechanism within DeFi, that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users. At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market. As a result, not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection.

As new markets hold more risk at launch, they are initially excluded from the SM protection. Today, most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO, they seem fit for SM protection.

# Motivation

The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi. This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market. As new markets hold additional risk, these are not initially protected by the SM. However, once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months, the risks are significantly lower. Furthermore, the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process, with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2.

Overall, these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market, holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market. This implies that, in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market, the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market. Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks, as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers.

Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers (lps) on these markets. By reducing the risk for lps, it is expected to lead to further growth of the market’s TVL overtime. Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets, lps are treated more equally across the markets.

The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets. In the case of Aave markets on other chains, the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure, and not failures caused by the chains themselves (Polygon/Avax). With regards to the Aave Arc Market, Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAO’s stated risk parameters, should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update, the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance.

These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem. In particular, the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive. Today, most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon, while just about 100k on Ethereum V2. These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections, in a shorter time period.

The table below shows the Aave V2 markets, assets listed and ecosystem collections for the Aave DAO.

63,"## Summary

A proposal to whitelist Connext, a trust minimized cross chain protocol, for V3 Portals on 6 chains: Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony - with credit lines for USDC ($2m on each chain), USDT ($1m on each chain) and ETH (40 ETH on each chain).

## Reasonale

[Connext](https://connext.network) is a network for **fast, trustless communication between chains and rollups**. It is the only interoperability system of its type that does this cheaply and quickly without introducing any new trust assumptions. Connext is aimed at developers who are looking to build bridges and other natively **cross-chain applications**.
To date, over $1.3b in transactions have crossed the network.

Our network of liquidity providers only works with native assets, or the most canonical representation of a wrapped asset.

With our [Amarok upgrade](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4), a series of improvements are coming for users, developers and liquidity providers (routers): the latest will be tasked with providing capital upfront to the users, while getting refunded within 30 minutes when the slower confirmation, coming from the [Optimistic communication protocol Nomad](https://blog.connext.network/optimistic-bridges-fb800dc7b0e0), is completed.

Users’ transactions get confirmed in seconds, LPs get rewarded with a fee on the transaction for their service.

**Portals are therefore a perfect match for Connext as our LPs will need and want to access immediate extra liquidity to fulfill transactions, and our new architecture allows for this operation to be completed via the protocol in a trust minimized way**.

## Technical Specifications

Connext is much more than a bridge, it’s an **interoperability protocol**: it allows to build cross chain applications without adding trust assumptions.
One of these applications are bridges, others could be cross chain NFTs marketplaces or cross chain governance portals.

**51 routers are currently providing $40m+ of liquidity.**
The highly capital efficient architecture of Connext allows for higher volume (and therefore higher returns) with less capital compared to other solutions in the space.
The system is currently working on a whitelist basis. Once the [NEXT token](https://blog.connext.network/whats-next-d3044de49397) is live, the whole network will be permissionless.

## How does it work?

This is an overview of the Amarok architecture that is currently on testnet and planned to go live in a few weeks:

![image](ipfs://QmZVvSsU5ra6vFvMiu82iMAieP1LFuS44EjsbLJVkeUj8N)

The new flow heavily utilizes Nomad (and eventually other localized messaging layers) for its security model. Routers front capital and execute calls for a user’s transaction, and claim against funds going through Nomad.


A full overview can be found [here](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4).

This model fits with the Aave Portals. This is how the simplified architecture integrating Portals will look like - credits to Delphi Digital for the image.

![image](ipfs://QmYug4RrSW8SgjdtqQY21ALDk7gYS1HcH8mSa5Jo4v4sqk)

([Development progress deep dive](https://github.com/connext/nxtp/pull/1074)).

The logic for the execute and reconcile methods for the Aave portals has been completed and is ready for audit.

#### Is there a fee model for participants?
LPs currently take a 5bps fee from every transaction

Bridge for users: https://bridge.connext.network

Technical documentation: https://docs.connext.network

## Proposed list Credit Line request

The credit lines are requested for the following networks where both Connext and Aave are already present.

Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony

![aave.png](ipfs://QmbxAKskwg6caRq4j9ogFUA5xUqmHSLmT8WU8mwXbJdg56)

Note: Routers providers are charging 5 bps to complete cross chain transactions.
All outstanding loans are repaid within 60 min (avg 30 min), effectively paying a high interest rate: 0.005% / 60 min → 44% APR

#### Incentives
A Liquidity Mining program might be approved by the DAO once the NEXT token goes live.

64,"## Introduction/Abstract

On April 18th the funding of the Balancer DAO for Q2 was ratified [[1](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xe05bc1a898797cd8f78f86bed25bac84efade2df1a959daee09f8dd7c69d3b36)]. As part of the proposal 21,250 BAL and $127,500 USDC was requested for contributor compensation. With the recent market downturn the ops multisig does not have sufficient BAL to pay the expected June Balaries (See here how discounted veBAL compensation is calculated [[2](https://balancergrants.notion.site/Compensation-cb303e0241d94d96bed110929947029d)] ). The proposal is to:

* ops subDAO Multisig [[3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325#tokentxns)] swaps its remaining USDC (expected to be 76892 USDC) after USDC Balaries for June with the treasury for the additional BAL required to pay out June Balaries in BAL (expected to be 22805 BAL ). This amount of BAL was calculated based on a BAL price of $3,66 on June 18th. After June has commenced the remaining BAL in the ops subDAO multisig will be sent back to treasury.

## Motivation

Preservation of USDC available for the Balancer DAO can be the prudent choice in the current market conditions. Therefore a swap of BAL (from the DAO treasury) <> USDC (from the ops subDAO Multisig ) with the Balancer DAO treasury would retain USDC on the DAO’s balance sheet and manage to pay the Balaries for June for people who are looking to get their Balary as discounted $veBAL.

## Risks (if applicable)

* While the ops subDAO made best efforts to poll contributors for their expected Balary, the official determination will happen at the end of the month via our monthly health-check.
* BAL price falls below 3,66 by the end of the month and a new proposal needs to be voted on to request the additional $BAL due to the decreased price of $BAL.

## Specification

* ops subDAO ( 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325 ) sends 76892 USDC to Balancer DAO treasury.
* Balancer DAO treasury ( 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f ) sends 22805 BAL to the ops subDAO multisig.",bullish

67,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Bril Finance’s Integration to Position Manager on BNB Chain!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re excited to announce an extension for CAKE rewards on Bril’s vaults. 

Bril Finance offers a DeFi integration that helps users manage their assets, optimize their earnings, and reduce the effort needed for managing positions. 

Users can deposit single-sided assets into Bril's vaults which are managed by Bril's smart contracts. These smart contracts will allocate the assets into PancakeSwap's v3 AMMs with a range of automated liquidity strategies to earn CAKE yield for users.

The CAKE rewards on Bril’s vaults have been adjusted to ensure **CAKE is distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner for CAKE holders.**

#### Bril Finance’s Vaults & Liquidity Pools:

Deposit single-sided assets to earn additional CAKE rewards on top of LP rewards. (Please note that the deposit token is the **first token** in the pair).

For example, for the **USDT**-WBNB (0.05%) pair, users will deposit USDT ONLY, and the SC will execute strategies to utilize the deposited USDT for the USDT-WBNB (0.05%) LP.


Vaults with an additional 1,200 CAKE rewards:
- **WBNB**-CAKE (0.25%)
- **USDT**-CAKE (0.25%) 
- **BTCB**-CAKE (0.25%)

Vaults with an additional 500 CAKE rewards:
- **USDT**-WBNB (0.05%)
- **BTCB**-USDT (0.05%)
- **ETH**-CAKE (0.25%)

CAKE rewards will be distributed with the following criteria:
- **Distribution duration:** 14 days
- **Total tokens:** 5100 CAKE 
- **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 13 Nov 2023
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 27 Nov 2023

The CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from Bril’s vaults will encourage more users to deposit single-sided assets, increasing LP liquidity, and ultimately leading to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

| Image taken from our [**tokenomics page**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics) |

Before the Finish Time of 27 Nov 2023, we will evaluate the performance of the vaults, and if appropriate, determine whether further incentivization would benefit CAKE holders.

#### Bril’s Manager Fee

There will be a **7%** manager fee introduced on all LP rewards earned via Bril Finance’s vaults.

#### How do you deposit into Bril’s Vaults?

Deposit single-sided assets into Bril’s Vaults on PancakeSwap’s Position Manager:

https://pancakeswap.finance/position-managers

#### What is the difference between Bril Finance and ICHI?

Bril Finance and ICHI are partnering to provide users with the above single-sided asset vaults. 

Bril Finance will be the user-facing interface, while ICHI will handle the smart contracts for the vaults.

# Summary

This publication introduces @TokenLogic and @Karpatkey as the DAO’s Financial Service Provider for an initial period of 180 days, with a proposed budget of 400k GHO. The scope of contribution will span the following areas of the DAO’s finances:

* Treasury Management;
* Strategic Assets’ Liquidity; and
* Safety Module.

The combined karpatkey and TokenLogic team presents an unparalleled offering of specialized skills and proven technical expertise, with a network that spans most of DeFi.

# Motivation

## Treasury Management

Aave is the leading cross-chain lending protocol by all relevant KPIs i.e. TVL, supplied; and borrowed assets. With the latest version (v3) present on 10 networks, Aave Protocol currently generates revenue across ten networks and 18 deployments (v1, v2 incl. Centrifuge and ARC, v3 incl. Spark), consolidating a cross-chain treasury that’s currently worth around $130M.

![|576x335](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/63TVEW32fnDI7_Dg3E5Mzw1XnQJd8284sa4VJ_XfrFWfVLsiEH4lX134c-X5StL4qo7L5QZOQaId-a8MQURHy2Ml3eeDfuSe8DdXRwDF-wK9cMJm26NLZjw9Ys6PZRYCT3YeUl7m49HJo_5C_tt9NeI ""Chart"")

In spite of having a significantly sized treasury, the Aave DAO faces mainly three challenges with its current treasury composition and operational practice.

### Portfolio Volatility

A significant portion of the treasury is held in the DAO’s native token (AAVE) which currently has limited DeFi utility and introduces volatility in the overall treasury value. The following chart illustrates the treasury allocation across various crypto assets.

![|522x304](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MAvZlV6jGMF6UfYcfO54H761nqHULxFYABWN0b-et8UjKGF1T9ZhzphJZqwlT6r8RcvQ2q9ovKLmLddvKRSiwwUhsAtlFoYpJCimdbzf6bUI0JkRsxkfed0HGSfwvh646x_mVaJlLVIA1Lc9ZltgwKA ""Chart"")

### Asset Dispersion

Treasury funds are dispersed around multiple collector contracts deployed in different blockchains. These funds are a direct result of how the protocol captures value and are mostly denominated in aTokens (~61) according to market activity, which requires constant rebalancing to meet expense requirements. This activity has historically been carried out through the governance processes, lacking comprehensive and up-to-date data on portfolio composition and rationale for asset allocation.![|688x384](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TOGbL74wUrt6nMH83_jLP5kdJMQqX0Bnm4F0Qy3b605oaEz6z0xO1A3qw8ysj1hZdjzqm8MlSLP8hlesdTy3CegW3JEErznwfRdUX1YzgJS2ni8Cdb0btuuJE35VvcQi1KJVMB-Z3w7bVaSGVtlvn7U)

The DAO has only recently gained the ability to move funds between Polygon and Ethereum, while all other Treasuries are isolated, often leading to missed opportunities for leveraging the DAO’s funds. These opportunities are crucial for enhancing and capitalizing on synergies within the Aave ecosystem, including GHO management and the Safety Module.

### Runway

According to the latest [forecasted expenses](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/), the DAO’s 12-month budget is over $19M.

Note:

1. Certora only.
2. AGD figures based on discussions with the team.

While there are ongoing plans to secure part of this amount of stablecoins, most of it is allocated in high utilization Aave lending markets. Although reckoning the strategic rationale, holding most of the assets in the DAO’s own protocol exposes the portfolio to excessive risk in a volatility event scenario e.g. exploit.

![|669x363](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Aq6xqeeq_hr2ObgV9PFBiQrn6BFRk718dJywySHO4U7jRyUXSsMDyl7CdMhdf1cGOht1143KdBZy4mEagWkrum9CBeapl2HnDnSFfRbFNaPB4-3pZH0veEu8nMoo2cAw3-uohJYNq8s8zKUn-J45spg ""Chart"")

With the aim to support the protocol’s self-sustainability, treasury management should aim to reduce long tail asset exposure, ensure a 12-month financial runway and a stablecoins allocation that balances servicing Aave users and the DAO’s capital preservation.

## GHO Development

Aave developed [GHO](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/overview) as a stablecoin native to the ecosystem and controlled by Aave Governance that enables a new level of transparency and censorship resistance. Technically, [GHO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f#readContract) is a collateral-backed stablecoin minted by users who lock up collateral assets in Aave's v3 protocol. The protocol uses smart contracts to manage the issuance and burning of the token through allow-listed entities called [Facilitators](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/how-gho-works/gho-facilitators), whose capacity to mint GHO (bucket) is enabled by Aave’s governance.

Aiming to enable committed AAVE token holders to capture additional value, GHO’s [debt strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) introduces an innovative concept of [rate discount](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) by staking AAVE.

With an [on-chain vote executed in July](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/aave/proposal/268?chart=0), Aave launched GHO with two Facilitators (Aave itself and GHO FlashMinter), a borrowing rate of 1.5%, and a discount rate of 30% for AAVE stakers. Since then, the borrowing rate has been [increased to 4.72%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9789e054e29f63da5713368be2dd0b4006f4564ef5e48c9d5e994ec20e932e35).

![|690x391](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7UXzX05dWaMixQmE4B-lkjHuv4-fu2jIFs8bn03_gLYG8hjpIm2mPHK4uhWVcyetMgZPUlWekoavWr1pfc43F15YuXkIZPy1r1K71mtU6WxdBl4rdzw4zMiABAUsHgRDP4d-BdkW_E-EcFgA1qArif0)

![|691x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qdTC5Jy9o8-ciz62oGpAZDGq2KOMK7V2h1S8PL-G6oawfXSJMz02eQSaeIofbcvmatQBOGogKZSyVDeLZCHpbSLDRsiCATHipR5EGO0lzc4jwoaiB3VpInOtUgiypK9UTy6mIflJpvlS6yaAmcn4pHE)

As demonstrated by GHO’s price chart, the most immediate challenge the Aave community is facing is the persistent trading of GHO at a discount practically since deployment. This trend has been influenced by higher stablecoin-enabled market rates like MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate (DSR), creating a rate arbitrage opportunity. This cycle of borrowing and selling GHO harms GHO holders as it generates selling pressure, leading to a loss of value and eroding trust in GHO's stability. It also encourages a speculative pattern among GHO minters motivated to borrow and dump the asset, followed by repurchasing at a lower price, further driving down its value.

For the long-term health and success of GHO, two more enduring aspects require the community’s attention:

### Peg Mechanisms

There's a crucial need for robust peg mechanisms tailored specifically for GHO that go beyond tactical borrow rate adjustments. Such mechanisms should be designed to help maintain GHO's value relative to its peg, irrespective of broader market movements or temporary arbitrage opportunities. Effective peg maintenance strategies will provide the dual benefits of protecting GHO's value in turbulent market conditions and reinforcing its utility as a stable and reliable medium of exchange within the DeFi ecosystem, thus addressing the core issue of price stability head-on.

### Demand

The second one is generating organic demand that leads to an increased supply, mainly demand vectors external to the platform, but also including growth rooted in value-generating activities within the DeFi ecosystem. Without these value-generating flows, GHO faces the risk of remaining underutilized, hampering both its adoption and functionality as a stablecoin meant to facilitate economic activity.

Currently, external demand for GHO has predominantly centered around its exchange for USD tokens and liquidity provision. While providing liquidity has been the sole avenue for yield generation, there has been a noticeable decrease in the allocated GHO liquidity recently.

## Safety Module

The Aave Safety Module (SM) provides the DAO with an insurance-like fund expected to repay users of lost funds resulting from Aave’s smart contract exposure. The current composition of the insurance fund is overweight AAVE to the point where there exists a negative feedback loop between potential Bad Debt exposure and the AAVE token price.

![|657x294](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Haaciw-Es4QZS2QZBueQ1g1ar-L_e_Lp6MRd1neEqlzndAy5gha5PLUtYYo1QKy_k80ZGSP-cEGf-rVYbRrqZ3L0W_m6kcN3EZBcW2ciXFr5FZnQR-jPlKBHKgzQ20dOmlAVksGqlflbCk-At3Uq4d4)

If a Short Fall event was to occur, speculators could frontrun the AAVE auction, potentially even trigger liquidations on Aave Protocol, and cause the auction to occur at a lower than otherwise AAVE price. This unintentional feedback loop can be partially mitigated by modifying the safety module fund with the introduction of additional assets over time.

Furthermore, the previously outlined negative feedback loop involving AAVE's price, liquidations, and bad debt results in a high cost for utilizing AAVE tokens. Consequently, it is necessary to reevaluate the incentivization of liquidity in the Safety Module, aiming for a more efficient allocation of DAO funds.

![|693x410](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/675CMMvT7wcInW2NSWdJ11ByiOKa-aC627ziLQQ_WSVR_nRljGEgKdaxRZbS5RRiAQ5MSVuYC-_Vu2_5fSiWBLtmxBuENsf2GJnBVqkOnTdgH4BabaF680wEQkHSWK2OxkO87lQs9ncUOhb8yQEcyPk)

The daily cost of sustaining the SM is estimated to be approximately 100k USD per day at the prevailing AAVE distribution rate and market price. If all the AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH can be auctioned off at spot prices, the insurance funds coverage ranges from 1.7% to 3.2% of TVL over the last 18 months. For each $1 of coverage provided, the Aave DAO is paying approximately 31 cents each year. With a reduction in AAVE rewards, as proposed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-amend-safety-module-aave-emissions/14936), the costs of sustaining the insurance fund will be reduced.

## Why Partnering?

All of the topics mentioned above are deeply connected. Most of the assets contained in the treasury derive their value partly from their liquidity and the protocol’s security; the Safety Module’s effectiveness relies on attracting external capital through LP incentives; and GHO’s peg mechanism is dependant on liquidity, which could be incentivized using the treasury’s holdings.

There hasn’t been a holistic approach to these core activities of Aave DAO’s financials so far, which ultimately has led to [uncoordinated](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061/11?u=karpatkey) and inefficient decision-making processes.

TokenLogic and karpatkey are partnering to provide Aave DAO with a comprehensive financial service solution. This partnership leverages:

* Over three years of experience in advancing the Aave Protocol through a pivotal role in feature development and product adoption; and
* A distinguished history of contributing to the most respected DAOs in the industry through specialized financial services.

The combined expertise of our teams is deeply rooted in the Aave ecosystem and extends across its community.

### TokenLogic

We are a proactive team that puts our partners' needs first. Our developers are already actively contributing to the Aave Protocol, 23 AIPs to date. We believe in Aave’s incremental improvement process and building solutions that enable the DAO to manage its finances efficiently whilst minimizing external dependencies.

Our dedication was demonstrated when we presented a proposal to improve the Aave DAO’s runway and built a preliminary frontend for the community. Our analysis will continue to showcase the interactive and transparent theme of the GHO Analytics platform. The refined scope primarily focuses on Treasury Management, GHO Liquidity/adoption and the Safety Module.

### karpatkey

karpatkey is a DeFi-native organization specializing in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with [GnosisDAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkeys-weekly-report-on-gnosisdao-farms/6219), [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386), [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665), [CoW Protocol](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624), and [Lido](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xac31f800288c68e32d1eb3cea7a525022faae3eb3bf805d1b3d248cda5375a13) on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions. Check out our [values](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-values) to understand a bit more about our guiding and decision-making principles.

As DAO treasury developers, we contributed to some of the most reputable DeFi protocols in our industry. We supported the adoption of xDAI across Gnosis Chain, [paving the way](https://x.com/GnosisDAO/status/1673343419232526340) for the deployment of sDAI that [boosted chain TVL](https://x.com/DLNewsInfo/status/1714990022598787118) and consolidated a stablecoin hub with the integrations like Angle and Spark. Our extensive experience provided us with advanced practical knowledge on DeFi primitives like stableswap and concentrated liquidity AMMs, liquidity, and voting incentives, veTokenomics, leverage and lending platforms, and integrations with top protocols.

In addition to being an active [Aave delegate](https://governance.aave.com/t/karpatkey-delegate-platform/14417) with more than 90 governance votes since August 7th, we’ve contributed to the [development of an Aave fork](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2022-year-in-review-for-gnosis/6431#lending-protocols-5) project and historically deployed, borrowed, and staked a combined $26.51M worth of LP positions in both Aave V2 and V3.

We now believe we can meaningfully contribute to solidifying Aave’s position as the leading DeFi lending protocol, not only through domain expertise but mostly through pushing positive-sum initiatives with the DAOs we work with.

# Specification

This proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO's treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.

## Architecture for Asset Management Tooling

We aim to define and implement a robust architecture for asset management. At a high level, this architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s ""shortExecutor"". All designs will be aligned with Aave best practices, and will encompass required steps to update existing infrastructure (e.g. SAM).

As the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.

## Financial Security

A key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO's known budget and anticipated expenses as shared above. This approach guarantees financial stability and an operational continuity for Aave DAO.

Key components of this objective will include:

* Bridging Aave funds from other blockchains to consolidate them in Ethereum;
* Migrating primary stablecoin funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3 for improved experience in using aTokens as payments; and
* Swapping secondary stablecoins in mainnet prioritizing GHO.

Do note, Financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.

As it currently stands, all necessary preparation for incorporating financial statements as part of the earlier TokenLogic proposal has been paused due to overall Aave budget considerations.

## Formation of the Aave Liquidity Committee

This expanded committee will oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:

* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO's price movement towards re-pegging, while maintaining its utility across a full range AMMs.
  * Utilize Maverick's design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.
  * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.
  * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.
  * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility on their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave's AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.
* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token's value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:
  * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.
  * Enhance GHO's extrinsic demand by incentivizing stableswap pools, such as Balancer's GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.
  * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer's architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO's price stability.
  * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.
  * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.
* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it in",neutral

75,"[ARC] - UI/UX upgrade governance framework
The Aave protocol is a decentralized ecosystem of smart-contracts running on several EVM networks. This ecosystem is permisionless and anyone with the required tech knowledge can freely use 100% of the Aave protocol features.

That being said, for a more accessible user experience, the Aave companies created the Aave application 4 allowing the interaction with the Aave protocol without technical knowledge.

To reinforce the decentralization of the application, the Aave app is deployed on IFPS and considering Flux hosting to avoid centralization of hosting,

also, the Aave app, is fully open source 1 and allows any developer to contribute to the improvement of the application for the benefit of the end-users.

Proposal to add support for MAI (aka miMatic) on Aave V3 (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche)

### Summary

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom. It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.

All accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.

There’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.

### Risk Parameters

* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain

### Specifications

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Core team at QiDao Protocol.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.

MAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.

Despite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.

MAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.

3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
Being the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.

MAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.

MAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.
* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance
* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.

5. How is the asset currently used?

* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)
* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap
* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon
* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM
* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties
* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave

6. Emission schedule

Users can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.

7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

All funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users
There is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences
The multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.
Since the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.

8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

* Market Cap: ~$250M
* 24h Volume: >$40M
* Volatility: Low
* Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose
* Maturity: Launched 5/4/21

## Background
The [Child Chain Gauge Factory V2](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20230316-child-chain-gauge-factory-v2) is the Layer Zero replacement for the old Child Chain Streamer style gauges.  These new gauges will enable veBAL boost to be extended to non-mainnet chains.

Beyond emitting BAL, Balancer Gauges have the ability to emit other externally provided tokens.  Projects such as Lido and Polygon have used this capability in the past to provide direct emissions to stakers.

In for a token to be used in a reward gauge, the add_reward function must be called on the gauge with the specified token.  This BIP Grants the Balancer Maxis the ability to manage external rewards tokens on gauges, and authorizes them to make decisions about what tokens to add based on their best judgement and in collaboration with other Balancer Service Providers.

## Risk Assessment
The main risk to adding external tokens to a gauge are that it could be used to distribute spam coins or other mallicious tokens through the gauge system.  The Balancer Maxis have demonstrated themselves as well qualified being both permissive but sensible.

83,"## Summary

Chaos Labs proposes an amendment to our current scope of work and compensation structure accordingly. Chaos Labs is requesting a $400,000 increase, bringing our total annual compensation to $2M.

## Motivation

In November 2023, Chaos Labs’ engagement with Aave DAO was [unanimously renewed](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/360/), underscoring our ongoing commitment and the expanded scope of our engagement with Aave, which has evolved significantly with Aave's expansion now across over 10 deployments.

This renewal was done during the bear market, prompting us to propose a community-friendly deal at a lower-than-market cost, given the challenging market conditions and being mindful of the broader economic environment. This was aligned with the feedback from major Aave stakeholders and delegates. However, the expansion of Aave to multiple chains, in addition to the increased volatility and activity across DeFi and crypto, has significantly increased our scope and workload, necessitating additional resources to maintain the high level of service required. 

As dedicated risk contributors, Chaos Labs adopts a holistic approach to managing the spectrum of responsibilities within Aave's ecosystem, including V3, GHO, and the continued offboarding of V2. Our commitment encompasses risk management, data science, analytics, and parameter recommendation, among other critical functions. An amendment to our compensation is essential to reflect better the resources committed, the depth of our engagement, and the substantial value we bring to the Aave community.

Considering improved market conditions and Aave’s growth over the past several months, we believe the DAO is now in a position to revise our compensation to more accurately reflect the current scale and impact of our engagement and allocated resources.

### Enhancing Aave's Risk Management Framework

The proposed compensation amendment is not merely a financial adjustment but a continued investment in our collaboration. With additional funding, Chaos Labs will be poised to:

- **Deploy Additional Resources:** Enhance support for existing and future Aave markets, ensuring comprehensive risk management across all deployments.
- **Develop and Optimize Risk Oracles:** Focus efforts on the continued development of the Chaos Risk Oracle specifically for Aave’s needs, enabling more efficient and dynamic risk parameter adjustments. This will further streamline the risk management process, reducing the need for manual interventions and significantly boosting the protocol's operational efficiency and security.
- **Expansion of Risk Monitoring and Alerts:** Our real-time monitoring and alert services are delivered via the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). We're committed to enriching these services with more comprehensive analytics and alerts, enhancing visibility and enabling users to meticulously evaluate ecosystem risks and the health of the protocol through intuitive dashboards and data visualizations. The deployment of Risk Oracles will introduce additional data, providing the community with an improved grasp of risk levels and updates to protocol parameters.

### Collaborative Expansion with a Second Risk Service Provider

Following Gauntlet's resignation as the second-risk service provider, we strongly support the idea of bringing on another service provider to complement our existing scope of work. As part of our engagement, we are committed to dedicating the required resources to assist with the onboarding process and ongoing collaborations, ensuring a seamless integration that enhances Aave's risk management capabilities without duplicating efforts.

### Conclusion

The requested compensation amendment is key for Chaos Labs to sustain and expand its support for Aave. It will enable us to allocate additional resources effectively, develop innovative solutions like the Risk Oracle, and continue our mission to enhance Aave's security and efficiency. We are committed to our partnership with Aave and believe that with the community's support, we can continue setting the standards for risk management in the industry.

## Specification:

We request an additional $400K for the remainder of our current engagement, bringing the total annual compensation to $2M. 

If this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0) as the recipient.

In terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 400,000 aUSDC or GHO. 

## Disclaimer:

Chaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and more. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.

This proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.

### Length of Engagement & Budget:

Given the successful completion of critical infrastructure initiatives and the ongoing demand for development resources, the Maxis have adopted a flexible discretionary budget approach, managing funds conservatively. We will continue operating in a similar manner as in Q2, anticipating increased demand for automation work and partner support due to new product launches.

Our spending will be closely monitored, with clear insights provided in our monthly reports, as demonstrated in Q2 2024. We believe this setup will significantly aid Balancer DAO in achieving its goals of becoming the hub for LRT, LST, and LRT liquidity.

Overall, people costs in USDC terms will remain consistent with [previous quarters](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-568-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2024/5625). The Maxis will receive part of their compensation in locked BAL, vesting over one year. With an average of 56% of compensation taken as locked BAL, this demonstrates our strong commitment and alignment with the Balancer ecosystem.

**Length of engagement: 3 months**
**Budget: 172’500 USDC and 14’464 BAL**

### Cost Breakdown

|Position|Cost per month|
| --- | --- |
|People Cost (USDC), 4.7 FTE|46’500 USDC|
|People Cost, 4.7 FTE (BAL, with 1.25 multiplier) - Locked for 1 year|4’821 BAL|
|Discretionary Budget to fund freelancers (2 FTE) and infrastructure cost (USDC)|20’000 USDC|

For Q3 the Maxis have decreased the ask for locked BAL resulting in a decrease of ask in the budget by 24'000 USD while also saving 27'000 USDC in Q2 from the discretionary budget which rolls over to Q3. This results in total savings of 51’000 USD compared to Q2.

ETH Address to Receive Funds: 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325

#### Impact on the Treasury

**The Treasury wallets currently hold ~3.95M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q3 2024 would cost around 0.37% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.46% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold ~5.43M in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3.18% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to ~12.7%.**

#### Proposal to Launch veCAKE Gauges System on zkSync

As mentioned in our initial [**veCAKE proposal**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), we are launching veCAKE in phases, and are excited to share the next deployment - zkSync!

#### Recap: Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

As a quick summary, here’s quick recap of veCAKE, with the following utilities:

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders will be able to directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE managers and bribe markets, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE rewards and receive voting incentives for doing so. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to automate their voting and potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
#### Inclusion of zkSync in veCAKE Gauges System

Currently, the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum is **~0.99 CAKE/block**.  

With the inclusion of zkSync, the current **Trading Allocation** emission of 0.0131 CAKE per block directed towards zkSync Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions. 

As part of the voting gauges design, the Kitchen proposes to retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs, such as ETH-USDC on zkSync. 



There are two key reasons:
- To ensure a smooth transition for liquidity providers from farms managed by the Kitchen to farms which are managed by veCAKE voting, without affecting their APRs significantly in the initial rollout
- To ensure that core liquidity pools continue to receive sufficient incentives, so that liquidity depth and fee generation are not significantly affected. This will ensure the continuity of CAKE burns from trading fees, which drives deflationary CAKE tokenomics.

In the initial rollout phase, the Kitchen will distribute these votes based on the following principles:
- Ensuring core liquidity pools are provided a competitive return on their LP positions
- Ensuring that existing Syrup Pool partner arrangements are met before migrating them fully to the veCAKE gauge voting system
- Ensuring that any of the smaller farms which did not receive any votes after the launch of veCAKE will receive at least some allocation in the initial rollout, capped at their current emission levels.

With the proposed vote allocation, the Kitchen will distribute its share of votes at the end of each voting epoch after all voting participants have voted. 

In other words, the Kitchen will apply its voting share (at maximum, translating to ~0.4 CAKE/block) as far as needed to smoothen out any possible abrupt changes in the Farms, while allowing veCAKE participants to get used to the gauge voting mechanism. 

If the gauge voting results will not affect any core liquidity pools and trading volumes significantly, the Kitchen will abstain from voting in that particular voting epoch or vote in alignment with existing votes.

Over time, the Kitchen aims to reduce the portion of CAKE emissions directly managed by the Kitchen as all veCAKE participants become familiar with the process.

More information can be found in our [**docs**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/vecake/gauges-voting/faq). 

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE launched shortly on zkSync after this vote concludes.",bullish
90,"## **Summary**

- Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum. Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world.
- The Nomic Foundation's work will be focused on Ethereum's developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum's public goods support structures.
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams.
- The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum's dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components.
- Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.
- **We're proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**

## **Ethereum developer experience**

When it comes to Ethereum, which is primarily a software development platform to build decentralized systems, developer experience is a key strategic aspect for success. Ecosystem growth requires more developers to build more software on top of Ethereum. Developer adoption and learning speed, core contributors to this growth, are critically affected by developer experience.

The rate at which the ecosystem innovates, coming up with new creations and solving difficult problems, both at the dapp layer and EVM/Solidity/Vyper layer, is also directly affected by developer productivity.

Software development platforms aren't new, and playbooks established by the great developer experience success stories (Rust, .Net, TypeScript, etc) prove that achieving a quality developer experience requires a specialized approach paired with a long-term, big-picture strategy. The potential impact in executing a dedicated effort for Ethereum would increase the ecosystem’s pace of innovation and growth, building a powerful compounding effect over the long term for the entire industry.

The inspiration for our vision came from our experience building Hardhat, which allowed us to see how deeply challenging it is to build sophisticated Ethereum tooling. **These challenges must be alleviated to bring about organic ecosystem-led improvement of developer experience that achieves world-class quality.**

## **Nomic Foundation**

Nomic Labs has been fully dedicated to Ethereum developer experience since 2019, and we're [now pivoting](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/introducing-the-nomic-foundation-an-ethereum-public-goods-organization-31012af67df9) to a non-profit foundation formally dedicated to Ethereum. We're aiming to build a long-lasting organization that makes Ethereum's public goods support structures stronger by contributing to the Ethereum Foundation's existing efforts, and reducing the ecosystem's reliance on any one organization for development platform components.

### **Roadmap**

Given the size and innovation pace of the ecosystem, there's no way to foresee exactly what needs developers are going to have as things scale. However, we do know what engineering foundations the ecosystem will need in order to build its own solutions.

Our overarching engineering strategy is to empower the ecosystem to build its own specialized tools. This plan is based on four strategic pillars of the stack, each of which offers an opportunity to leverage a platform to empower the ecosystem to keep building open-source infrastructure.

For each of these pillars, we will build a platform. The four ecosystem pillars and platform opportunities we've identified are:

1. Solidity
2. EVM tooling
3. Local development environment
4. Ethereum connector library

## **The projects**

### **Slang & Rethnet**

Over the long term, these are our most important projects. Targeting the Solidity and EVM tooling pillars, Slang and Rethnet will serve as core infrastructure for the ecosystem to build new tools faster, cheaper, and better. We're essentially building the tools that would have let us build Hardhat a lot faster. We previously published a [Medium post](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/slang-rethnet-2ad465fd7880) with high-level descriptions of how both projects will complement each other.

**Slang**

A Solidity compiler designed as a platform for tooling development, an approach also known as compiler as a service. Its top priority will be servicing tools through domain-specific APIs. Much like .Net's Roslyn, it will feature a compilation pipeline made of distinct reusable components with standalone APIs. A completely modular design guarantees that others can build on top of it by replacing the part of functionality they need to, and reusing everything else:

1. Parser that is only concerned with producing trees from code. Usable on its own, for example, to create third-party formatters like Prettier plugins.
2. Semantic analysis (binding) is concerned only with building a type system and validating the produced trees. Usable on its own, to implement third-party type checking, security/threat models, and more advanced third-party linting.
3. Code generation. By replacing just this isolated part, the compiler can compile for different targets (e.g. non-EVM L2s).
4. Language services. These will receive an immutable representation of the above (syntax trees, bound trees, codegen settings), and will only be tasked with answering questions. Usable on its own to expose in different IDEs (same service for VSCode, IntelliJ, Vim, etc). Reusable to extend the functionality of other editor features (task runners, testing, deployment, CI, debugging).
5. Runtime observation APIs to support Rethnet.

All of this will be reusable to create entirely new EVM programming languages, since by replacing the parser and type system, one can get an entire high-quality toolchain working from the get-go.

**Rethnet**

To provide a simulated environment where developers can build and test their Ethereum software, tools need to replicate many of the components that make up a full Ethereum node implementation. This is a significant engineering effort, which given the complexity of Ethereum, represents a barrier to entry to tooling development given the depth of knowledge that is required.

Rethnet aims to make this easier by offering a native, flexible, extensible, fast, and language-agnostic EVM local development network, distributed as a Rust library, that is designed to be the underlying core in tools that provide debugging information to developers (like Hardhat, Foundry, Remix, Truffle, DappTools, etc). It will be a Rust library made to be consumed from other languages like TypeScript, Go, Python, etc as a native dependency. It will implement the baseline of essential functionality every tool should have like Solidity console.log, stack traces, and descriptive error messages, as well as implement code coverage, gas profiling, and a step debugger. At its core, it's an implementation of an Ethereum node with a layer of EVM runtime observation to provide development features.

Building a new Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, or DappTools using Rethnet will be a much more manageable project, and Rethnet will be completely reusable for any EVM language through adapters.

### **Hardhat**

Our flagship project targets the local development environment pillar, and it's currently at an advanced level of progress and adoption. While Slang and Rethnet mature and catalyze organic growth in the tooling space, developers still have needs to be met, positioning Hardhat as our immediate-term solution to empower developers to keep decentralizing the world.

Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment that developers use to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. Most importantly, it's highly flexible, extensible, and designed to empower the community to build their own solutions. This strategy has been successful, and there's already [a valuable ecosystem of reusable plugins](https://hardhat.org/plugins/).

Hardhat's roadmap is focused on becoming an extensible development environment with deep integrations across components in key areas of the tooling stack:

- [Hardhat VSCode](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/hardhat-vscode-9de29467fc26) — programming editor
- [Hardhat Ignition](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/hardhat-ignition-5a34a4e3d2de) — contract deployment
- [Hardhat Network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/) — local development network
- [Hardhat Runner](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview) — build/testing workflow

This roadmap leads to developers being well equipped to build powerful extensions to their workflow that increase their productivity according to their exact needs, and to then share them with the ecosystem in the form of plugins.

Hardhat will also eventually migrate to using Rethnet and Slang, increasing its feature richness, speed, and stability while enabling dogfooding at scale for our brand new building blocks.

### **Web3.js as a frontend platform**

The OG Ethereum connector library, Web3.js, is being revitalized into a high-value project. By focusing on community and ecosystem growth, supported by an extensible architecture, it can become a great source of value, much like React represents in the front-end world, but for dapps. A website hub connecting community spaces, support spaces, educational resources, extensions, and related projects, combined with an active ecodev effort (workshops, talks, contests, and incentives), will create a source of leverage for the ecosystem. This will provide better troubleshooting, faster developer training, more reusable code, and, most importantly, the possibility of extending the library. This effort is currently spearheaded by the ChainSafe team.

## **Funding**

The Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we’re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.

The Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we're aiming to raise $15M more.

## **Why Uniswap?**

Generally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we've approached and will continue approaching several protocols.

Currently, Uniswap [is built using Hardhat](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts). While this is a signal of Hardhat’s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We’ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:

1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).
2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.
3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.
4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.
5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.

We believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we’d love to have the **Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort**.",neutral
91,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-increase-aave-captier-from-cap5-to-uncapped-100m-uncapped/1353). If approved, changes would take effect at **00:00 UTC on Monday, March 8**.

This is a proposal to raise the liquidity mining cap from $100M to uncapped for $AAVE

# The Proposal

After the activation of the Balancer Based Safety Module 20 Days ago, the liquidity for $AAVE quickly grew to be the Largest Balancer protocol Liquidity Pool as new LPs join the AAVE/BAL incentivized Safety Module.

![image|690x101](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/464af158056f0a77cbf50195bfc2bb8a987826c1.png) 

Current APY by staking in the Safety Module is 29.34%, only considering the AAVE rewards, The Pool is still growing and Balancer is now the best protocol to swap AAVE onchain.

As BAL is a collateral option in Aave, aBPT stakers can use their BAL rewards to unlock more borrowing power in the Aave Protocol.

Uncapping the BAL rewards for the AAVE/ETH pool will allows even further incentive to bring more liquidity onchain and increase the synergies between the Aave & Balancer protocols.

# What is The Safety Module?

The Aave Safety Module acts as a collateral for the whole Aave ecosystem. AAVE holders, and now - with the new Balancer Based Stake - AAVE/ETH holders benefit from long term rewards for securing the protocol from insolvency, while at the same time bearing the risk of being slashed in case of shortfall events.
Having a very liquid onchain market and a consistent capital allocated in the Safety Module greatly increases the safety of the Aave ecosystem and the Aave protocol liquidity providers.",bullish

Authorize the PoolRecoveryHelper contract to put Weighted and ComposableStable pools in Recovery Mode
Authorize Balancer Labs Ops Multisig to manage the RecoveryModeEnabler contract


# Motivation

It has recently come to our attention that rate providers can cause some operations to revert if the call to `getRate` reverts. This goes undetected by most order routing algorithms, which assume rates change slowly and only use the pool's internal rate cache for estimating the expected outputs of a transaction.

In order to prevent pools with faulty rate providers from interfering with order routing algorithms, Balancer Labs has developed the [PoolRecoveryHelper](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20221123-pool-recovery-helper), a smart contract which performs checks on all rate providers of a given pool and puts the pool into Recovery Mode if one of the rate providers reverts.

The notion of Recovery Mode was introduced in recent pool factories. Only addresses authorized by Balancer Governance can put pools in Recovery Mode. 

When a pool enters Recovery Mode, any protocol fees it owes at that time are forfeited and a new exit kind is enabled, that bypasses updating the rate cache.

When a pool is put in Recovery Mode, this fact is recorded in the subgraph and order routing algorithms can ignore the pool.

The PoolRecoveryHelper contract is permissionless. Anyone can trigger a check, but the pool will only be put in Recovery Mode in the event that the rate provider required for that pool to work properly reverts.

The contract can only interact with pools deployed from a set of factories. The initial set includes the [ComposableStable](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220906-composable-stable-pool) and [Weighted](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220908-weighted-pool-v2) pool factories deployed in September. If approved, this proposal will also authorize the Balancer Labs Ops Multisig to add/remove factories to/from this set - but in addition to that safety mechanism, permissions will still have to be granted by Governance for each new factory individually just like in this proposal.

98,"Pancake swap has just announced that more farms will have reduced rewards. Those who understand PCS understand why this is being done. To reduce CAKE emissions. However over the past several months has only resulted in those projects getting less liquidity...and ultimately fizzling out of defi. 
This hurts PCS. This hurts defi.

A DEX needs liquidity. More emphasis needs to be placed on this. People don't understand that you make money even when there are NO Cake rewards. And PCS does not educate people in that regard.

However deincentivizing pools that have taken the time to be a part of the PCS ecosystem isn't the solution. 

As I've mentioned in a previous proposal...the only solution to keeping CAKE emissions as they are, yet still incentivizing more liquidity and pools is to create a token specifically for farming. One that is designed for the future. The current CAKE tokenomics does not support more liquidity. There is less than 0.5% of BTC on PCS...which speaks to how much growth potential there is...but if the BTC/BNB pool were to get 10X more liquidity the APR would be 0.9% at current prices. Taking what little CAKE reards from smaller projects to keep supporting the main pool s does not support innovation and long-term growth. 

Create a new token that requires you to
1. Hold a minimum amount of CAKE
2. Supports 10X liquidity growth while still giving compettive rewards
3. Support higher APR in ALL pools including the longterm pool

PCS is the best in the business at creating tokenmoics with burn mechanisms etc to prevent a dilution of the new token.",bearish

100,"**Summary** :

sUSD is a decentralized stable coin over collateralized by the SNX token. sUSD is already listed on AAVE markets as a lendable asset as well as SNX which can be used as collateral in addition to borrow/lending. There is significant liquidity for sUSD on both Mainnet and Optimism. I am proposing for it to be enabled as collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism with a 10 million sUSD supply cap.

**Risk Parameters**
- set sUSD max LTV to 60%
- set liquidation threshold to 75%
- set liquidation penalty to 5%
- upgrade the interest rate curve to that of DAI/TUSD
- Fixed lending is not enabled.

**Motivation**

sUSD market cap has grown tremendously over the past year, and the steady demand for decentralized stable coins has contributed to its growth. sUSD is highly over collateralized by SNX, the governance token, and backstop for the Synthetix protocol.

The rise in its liquidity on major dexes has contributed to sUSD stability over the past year, and allowing collateral use would promote its liquidity in aave markets.

**Rationale**

SNX stakers are incentivized to actively manage their debt relative to their SNX stake and sometimes cause spikes in demand for sUSD on markets including AAVE (especially when there are other Yield generating opportunities with sUSD), this may cause small deviations from the peg but with low volatility.

From a counter-party risk perspective, all underlying functions in relation to sUSD are fundamentally the same as that of SNX.

The SNX and sUSD contracts are fully upgradeable. Still, all changes must go through a formal governance process from SIP to deployment, which would be announced well before the upgrades are made and thus does not present a substantial counter-party risk.

The sUSDv2CRV pool has deep liquidity on L1, and with incentivizes, the L2 pool will soon have deep liquidity. 

In addition to sUSD, there are other synth pools on Curve with emission gauges to supplement sUSD liquidity (sBTC, sETH ). All synths are redeemable at their dollar value in sUSD at the ChainLink quoted price through the Synthetix protocol or Curve (via cross-asset swaps); thus they help facilitate the arbitrage sUSD peg deviations.

Proposal to add gauge support for the pool WETH/LUSD/LQTY on Ethereum with a 10% emission cap.

- WETH 33.34%
- LUSD 33.33%
- LQTY 33.33%

## Protocol Description

Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD - a USD-pegged stablecoin and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.

In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. User’s borrowing against their ETH use decentralized 3rd party front ends. 

LUSD has proved its impeccable resilience in time by getting through severe market crashes untroubled.

LQTY is the secondary token issued by Liquity. It captures the fee revenue that is generated by the system. 

Liquity is the only lending service available in DeFi that is unstoppable & likewise, LUSD is the only stablecoin capable of resisting all kinds of censorship. Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free. No person or group has any control over the protocol — it is “set in stone” in smart contract code and can never be changed.

Number 1 on DeFi Safety

Liquity is the DeFi product with the highest process quality in the space, according to DeFi Safety. 

## Motivation

To summarize, LUSD is the Liquity protocol stablecoin. It uses ETH only as collateral. And LQTY is the secondary token issued by Liquity, capturing the fee revenue. Furthermore, LQTY stakers earn ETH and LUSD as rewards. And LUSD Stability pool depositors that earn LQTY and ETH. 

So there is already an established demand for the WETH/LUSD/LQTY pool. And even during the bear current market, the demand for Liquity has not diminished. On the contrary, since the mid-June market crash:

* $LUSD market cap went up from $150M to $185M (23%+ increase)
* Troves went up from 473 to 852 (80%+ increase)
* The number of $LQTY and $LUSD holders is also steadily growing in time
* Liquity is now no. 14 in TVL for DeFi protocols on Ethereum

There are two main reasons behind the growing demand. The first one is the recent events with collapsing centralized lending entities that have lost users’ funds and trust. An increasing number of them now choose Liquity, which offers no counterparty risk. 

The recently introduced Chicken Bonds are the second main reason for the increased interest in Liquity. LUSD Chicken Bonds offer an amplified yield-earning and trading opportunity for LUSD holders while helping to reduce the stablecoin premium and improve its liquidity. It has attracted 50m+ TVL in its first 50 days. 

In conclusion, the WETH/LUSD/LQTY pool should attract significant interest in the Balancer community. Besides, the recent release of LUSD Chicken Bonds further increased the demand for such a pool.

## Specifications

1. **Governance**: Liquity has no governance. It is built to maximize trustlessness and decentralization. 
2. **Oracles**: Chainlink is Liquity’s primary oracle. They are the largest player in the oracle space, have an excellent track record, are sufficiently decentralized, and are constantly improving their systems. 

    Tellor is Liquity’s secondary (fallback) oracle. They’re fully decentralized — price data is requested, with a “tip” attached — and miners compete to push accurate data and win the tip. Inaccurate data is disputed, and the threat of stake-slashing incentivizes honest price reporting

3. **Audits**: Multiple security audits have been conducted by various auditors. All relevant documents are available in the documentation. Additionally, Liquity runs a bug bounty program with Hats Finance. 
4. **Centralization vectors**: There are no centralization vectors. Liquity is built to have maximized resilience. 
5. **Market History**: Over the last months, we have observed a premium on LUSD results from a structural unbalance between offer and demand. It was further aggravated by recent events leading more and more users to worry about the censorability of centralized stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) and decentralized stablecoins primarily backed by centralized ones (like DAI or FRAX). 

    The situation led to a considerable demand surge for censorship-resistant stablecoins that only LUSD can answer since there is no other alternative with a significant TVL. Thus, we have seen LUSD trading at a premium and slightly above the peg, partially caused by the increased demand for LUSD. Nevertheless, hard peg mechanisms are built into the system between $1 and $1.10, and soft peg incentives in between. Further, Chicken Bonds are already helping to reduce the stablecoin premium, and this effect will strengthen as the protocol grows. 


    You can check here the historical data of LUSD and LQTY

6. **Value**: There is a proven in-time demand for WETH/LUSD/LQTY and the pool will be stable and beneficial for the Balancer community.

### **Introduction/Abstract**

This proposal aims to bring the Snapshot strategy in line with the original expectations for space based snapshot delegation, by simply using the raw vlAURA balance instead of the voting power, which is delegated on-chain with the vlAURA contract. 

In plain English, it proposes using only one layer of delegation rather than two.

### **Motivation**

There are several reasons to make this change:

- It is simpler to measure voting power with one delegation rather than two layers
- vlAURA holders may choose to delegate to Balancer delegates rather than Aura delegates for Balancer proposals
- Many vlAURA holders are delegating with voting marketplaces such as Hidden Hand and may wish to override their vote on Balancer proposals

### **Risks**

This is a relatively minor adjustment to the Snapshot Space as vlAURA-veBAL is already supported, and the calculation for the underlying veBAL remains the same. The new strategy has been tested thoroughly. 

### **Specification**

**Current strategy**

The current Balancer voting strategy uses three sub-strategies:

1. veBAL balance (`erc20-balance-of`)
2. A delegation strategy (`delegation`) for the `balancer.eth` space using veBAL balance (`erc20-balance-of`) and vlAURA votes mapped to the underlying veBAL balance (`aura-vlaura-vebal`)
3. vlAURA votes mapped to the underlying veBAL balance (`aura-vlaura-vebal`)

In this strategy, vlAURA holders delegate their AURA through Aura's delegation system (i.e. not the Balancer delegation space), and cannot override the vote of their delegate. Given many vlAURA holders delegate with voting marketplaces like Hidden Hand, this is sub-optimal and complicated, since it involves two layers of delegation.

**Proposed strategy**

Change the vlAURA parts of the strategy to use a new strategy (`aura-balance-of-vlaura-vebal`) that maps the vlAURA balance (not delegated votes) to the underlying veBAL balance.

In this strategy, vlAURA holders can choose to delegate their vote via the Balancer delegation space. The vlAURA vote delegation does not affect voting power. Similarly to holding and delegating veBAL in this strategy, vlAURA holders can choose to override the vote of their delegate for a given proposal.

Recently a[ proposal was passed](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xbd025f8f5a0b1d748a8ad034f5a2b6fd50cc8ff7257cbee6b8344b2a70e9e2ed) to add various candidates to our replacement signers list for the DAO Multisig. These replacements have been completed on Ethereum and remain ongoing on Polygon, Arbitrum, and Fantom. You can see the most up to date list of signers [here](https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/governance/multisig). In order to ensure the activities of the DAO Multisig can continue uninterrupted we should replenish our list of available replacements. Thus, I propose adding the following people to the approved list of replacements:

* Lewis, Stablecoin Labs / Gyroscope (0xbcf751dBfe314Ee96A660EFA2Fcb259CBc364c29)
* Mounir, Paraswap (0x0951ff0835302929d6c0162b3d2495a85e38ec3a)

* Mr. Kind, BeethovenX (0xD876847533828bE6770D1dEdB6F8f5E91fed824e)
* Hubert, StakeDAO (0x28827186555d99d9eF9E1fdB97F65C93BA554F86)

As a reminder, the DAO Multisig can tap a replacement from the approved replacements list at their discretion whenever the need arises. Currently the only approved replacement candidate is:

* Evgeny Yurtaev, CEO at Zerion (0xcec0d1a31129af0b1088a3d8dfa6abb4bd1ecb45)

### Specification

If approved, the above listed candidates will be added to the approved replacement signer list and utilized if/when needed. Kain has signaled his desire to leave the DAO Multisig due to being too busy with his other activities and he will be replaced with Mounir from Paraswap immediately.

109,"I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CONTROVERSIAL BUT PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND THE LONG TERM EFFECT!

I humbly suggest we temporarily freeze both CAKE POOLS on PancakeSwap. As recently seen the entire crypto market has been booming but CAKE seems to be going in the opposite direction in terms of price. As seen many decisions have been taken that have not been beneficial to CAKE.

Buy NFTs using BNB = Why not buy using CAKE?

Reducing the block amount of CAKE whilst introducing lower APRs throughout POOLS has also not been of any benefit. 

The anount of CAKE being minted daily is reflected in the price of CAKE, which is steadily declining. Many other sites and DEXs are offering CAKE as rewards, there is currently 1 I am aware of offering over 300% APR in CAKE rewards, which definitely will not help boost the price considering the amount being minted, regardless of how much CAKE is getting burned, again which is not doing a whole lot for the price.

Instead I recommend introducing a wider variety of POOLS, with better APRs to stay competive.

Unless the dev team is able to chase down all these other sites from removing CAKE pools from their sites (reserving the right for only PCS to issue CAKE as rewards) the only way for the price is down. 

As a community it is of utmost importance we get minting down to reasonable levels, for CAKE to ever reach the top 10 list. If dev team are unable to control who offers CAKE as rewards I suggest freezing CAKE POOLS for 1 month. 

If after 1 month the price has recovered significantly, I suggest we unfreeze the CAKE POOLS and freeze again if and when necessary.

110,"Rationale

Matter Labs team proposes the L2 expansion of Venus Protocol to ZKsync Era (referred to as “ZKsync”). Through deploying on ZKsync, Venus can provide users fast and cheap transactions, without compromising on security or decentralization. 

Motivation

ZKsync is a Layer 2 rollup solution for Ethereum that provides high speed and low-cost transactions by using zero knowledge proofs. Scalability is achieved through processing and bundling transactions off-chain and then verifying the bundles on Ethereum, via validity proofs. ZKsync has one billion+ in TVL and millions of active users. Venus Finance can take advantage of ZKsync’s high performance, while tapping into its DeFi ecosystem and user base.

Benefits of Deploying on ZKsync:

- Fast and Cheap Transactions: Support more users with the high throughput and single cent gas fees offered by ZKsync.
- Ecosystem and User Base: Access ZKsync’s ~$1.1Billion TVL and serve 3.6Million monthly active users.
- Interoperability: Plug into the liquidity and user base of other blockchains using ZKsync technology with native interoperability and account abstraction (e.g., Cronos blockchain, from Crypto.com).
- EVM Compatibility: Refactoring will be limited considering ZKsync is EVM compatible.
- Partnership Support: Co-marketing, introduction to ZKsync Defi teams, and technical support will be provided by the Matter Labs team, a core contributor to ZKsync.

Risk Analysis

ZKsync has undergone numerous internal and external audits by OpenZeppelin, Halborn, and Spearbit. Over $8m has been spent on audits and bug bounties so far. Currently, there is a $1.1m bug bounty.

• [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/tangibleDAO)

**Protocol Description:**

Real USD (USDR) is a stablecoin backed by tokenized Real Estate that natively yields 8-10%. It was created by Tangible, a RWA tokenization protocol.

**Motivation:**

Following the successful launch of our Balancer Polygon gauge we're excited to expand to mainnet and reap the benefits of boost, the Aura ecosystem and core pool auto bribes.

We've been accumulating TetuBAL/VeTetu on Polygon and will begin to accumulate AuraBAL, vlAURA and VeBAL on mainnet. 

**Specifications:**

1. Governance: Real USD, the treasury composition and changes to the design will be governed by locked TNGBL token holders, this governance is not yet in place but will be soon.

2. Oracles: We have our own oracles for properties at the moment, but are working with Chainlink to get set up, then true property valuations via 3rd party [Hometrack.com ](http://hometrack.com/) can be reflected on chain in Real Time so the treasury values and the collateralization ratio are upto date, this also allows for “minting on gains” to work more effectively in real time.
3. Audits: https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/audits
4. Centralization vectors: The Real Estate obviously exists in the real world as is managed by an entity, Tangible Custody, this entity collects rent and converts to USDC and sends to the rent smart contracts.
5. Market History: In our short time since launch we have not lost peg.
6. Value: Post Shanghai there is a high probability that staked ETH percentage increases, leading to lower yield and therefore revenue on LSD TVL for Balancer. wUSDR has a native yield of circa 10% that scales with market cap, this could be a good source of longterm revenue for Balancer as USDR grows.

Technical Documentation: Bridging Bitcoin To Avalanche: A Technical Overview | by Michael Kaplan | Avalanche | Jun, 2022 | Medium
Support Documentation: Avalanche Bridge | Avalanche Support

## Summary

This is a proposal to list BTC.b as a collateral asset. BTC.b is the bridged version of Bitcoin from the Avalanche Bitcoin bridge.

## Motivation

The Avalanche Bridge has become a cornerstone piece of infrastructure for the Avalanche community, introducing an innovative security model that uses Intel SGX technology to usher in a new era of bridge technology. The Bitcoin bridge will allow users to directly on and off-ramp from the Bitcoin network and enable Bitcoin users the chance to participate in DeFi. It is a seamless, easy and secure process.

## Driving Factors

Secure: the bridge must be audited and built with security-first technologies.
Cost-Effective: the cost of bridging assets should be low.
Fast: the transaction should take the least amount of time possible.
Transparent: users should be informed of the transfer status at every step of the process.
Intuitive: users new to crypto asset transfers can easily understand the steps to use the bridge.
Specifications

### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
The author of the AIP is a representative of the Ava Labs team.

### Provide a high-level overview of the project and the token

Ava Labs is the servicing firm behind the Avalanche blockchain. Avalanche is a network that is EVM compatible and can scale both vertically and horizontally through the subnet architecture and rollups. Avalanche subnets can also support custom virtual machines and many programming languages.

BTC.b is the Avalanche bridged version of native Bitcoin and is non-custodial and permissionless allowing for one of the best and easiest on/off ramps to the Bitcoin network.

### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good asset to borrow or use as collateral?

BTC.b is redeemable for the native version of BTC and might be the quickest, easiest and safest way to get BTC on-chain. As we have seen in recent times CeFi carries its own risks and BTC.b allows another avenue to get BTC on-chain.

BTC.b is already integrated into multiple DeFi protocols within the Avalanche ecosystem such as Trader Joe, Platypus Finance, Pangolin, Benqi, and Paraswap.

### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Avalanche’s primary network consisting of its X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain went live a little over a year ago with on-chain protocols launching around that time and since then has not had any downtime. C-Chain is an EVM-compatible contract chain and Avalanche subnets allow for horizontal scaling into a variety of virtual machines and languages.

The Avalanche Ethereum Bridge is the most popular Ethereum bridge in terms of TVL and the network has become very popular for DeFi, peaking at 2nd or 3rd in terms of TVL only behind Ethereum. Avalanche initially struggled to gain liquidity and traction but Avalanche Rush, Avalanche’s liquidity mining program that took place in the Autumn of 2021, attracted both Ethereum bluechip protocols and thousands of new users. Avalanche also has native stablecoins ensuring some of the bridge risks are taken away.

### How is the asset currently used?

Currently, there is about $28M worth of BTC.b bridged to Avalanche C-Chain. Some of the top protocols with BTC.b integrated include $30M of liquidity deposited in Platypus Finance, the Avalanche native stableswap, $2.6M of liquidity within the Benqi lending protocol, and $14M of liquidity for the AVAX-BTC.b pair within the AMM Trader Joe.

### Emission schedule
No emission schedule

### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

The bridge uses Intel SGX with a total of 8 wardens and the approval structure of 6 of 8. The wardens include Ankr, Blockdaemon, Chainstack, Protofire, Avascan, Ava Labs, Bware Labs, and Halborn. BTC bridging with Avalanche Bridge is not supported with Metamask or any other wallet other than the Avalanche Core Wallet. This is because the Core Wallet Extension was custom built to support Bitcoin and the Avalanche Bridge and to handle the technical problems of linking Bitcoin and EVM chains within a wallet.

### How It Works/Technical Specifications

The Bridge can be broken down into two main parts: the SGX application and a set of third-party indexers and verifiers called “Wardens.” The Wardens are responsible for indexing the Avalanche and Bitcoin blockchains and submitting eligible transactions to the enclave for processing. The SGX application requires 3 of 4 Wardens to submit the same transaction before generating the signed transaction to process the Bridge transfer on the other network. For security reasons, neither the enclave nor the Wardens are directly accessible to bridge users. Instead, they’ll explicitly whitelist each other’s IP addresses for direct communication. In addition, all communication between the Enclave and Wardens will be encrypted and verified using TLS and include an HMAC signature. For relaying information to the Bridge user base, each warden hosts a JSON file containing the current bridge settings, assets requirements, and attestation report. The front end is set to disable itself if there’s any discrepancy within the critical information.

### Proposed Technical Parameters

BTC.b is proposed to start with a 70 percent max LTV, a 75 percent liquidation threshold, and a 6.5 percent liquidation penalty. With the level of on-chain liquidity and the ability to bridge from BTC.b back to native BTC quickly and exchange on centralized exchanges for native Avalanche stablecoins, these parameters are safe.",bullish

Here we add value and usage for the coin and a exponencial percentage to who make the liquidity and holds CAKE at same time.

The increase of the demand will appear just in the beginning of this idea, and forces market makers to holds the coin for more profit in the swap of the liquidity pools.

Travala.com has published a proposal for the Venus community to integrate XVS as a payment option on their website. 

This partnership would provide significant benefits for the Venus community by expanding the utility of XVS in the real world through travel bookings. The marketing support and exposure provided by Travala, along with the convenience of booking with preferred cryptocurrencies, would further enhance the integration's appeal. 

Travala's established presence in the travel industry, with major partnerships and a Best Price Guarantee policy, offers a strong foundation for this collaboration. 

By leveraging Travala's platform, Venus can tap into a large user base that is already accustomed to using cryptocurrencies for travel bookings. The proposal's focus on boosting XVS's utility and accessibility aligns well with the strategic vision of both the Venus community and Travala. 

The initial support from Venus DAO to cover integration costs and marketing expenses demonstrates a commitment to driving the success of this partnership.",bearish

128,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to BNB Chain v3 Farm Rewards

As we continue to optimize CAKE rewards across all of our deployments, we are able to gradually lower the overall CAKE emission, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate a smooth trading experience. Ultimately, this enables us to contribute a greater amount of CAKE towards the weekly burn. 

The previous round of [**Adjustments to Farm Rewards**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x3e68425e233875d0ed4d553e0da44bfe927f75d56714545c7a7c7ea4a9b4a35c) increased the overall CAKE burn by approximately **4,000 CAKE per day** with minimal impact to trading volumes.

Given the traction and overall market share shown on our BNB Chain v3 deployments, this proposal aims to decrease emissions to the farms listed below and increase the overall CAKE burn by approximately **1,700 CAKE per day**.

These optimizations will add up over the coming months to 1) improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across farms and 2) redirect CAKE rewards towards the highest growth farms, ultimately accelerating the path towards ultrasound CAKE.

#### Adjustment Details

With the above in mind, we are proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below. Note, all other BNB Chain v3 farms will continue to earn the same level of rewards and even with these adjustments, the farms below will continue to have a healthy level of liquidity, volume, and APR.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their average daily volume, 14-day volume, capital efficiency, and alternatives available.

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Add to rETH Holding
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & @DefiJesus + ACI - @MarcZeller 
created: 2023-10-14

---

# Summary

This publication proposes acquiring rETH with ETH held in the DAO's Ethereum Treasury.

# Abstract

This publication proposes converting a portion of the wETH, awETH and wEthWETH held in the Treasury to rETH.

A balance of 100 aEthWETH will remain in the Treasury to facilitate on going DAO expenses such as the [Quarterly Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680) and any other future expense that arise.

# Motivation

At the time of writing the Aave DAO has the following assets in the Ethereum Treasury:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 14.56 |22,543.32|
|awETH|530.39|820,829.60|
|aEthWETH|510.45 | 789,962.05|

The following assets are available to be claimed from the Paraswap Legacy Fees and Fee Claimer contract:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 4.53 |7,011.99|
|wETH| 10.8 |16,717.32|

This publication proposes converting all wETH, awETH and all but 100 aEthWETH to rETH. The 100 aEthWETH is to remain to support on going DAO funding. 

The table below shows the yield differential between the various assets:

|Asset|Yield (%)| 
| --- | --- | 
|wETH| 0.00|
|awETH|1.26|
|aEthWETH|1.97 |
|rETH|3.07|

Based upon current market conditions, the additional yield generated by converting the assets as outlined to rETH is $23,266.50. 

Upon implementation of this [ARFC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-aave-v3-eth-pool-weth-parameters/15110), the additional yield generated is ~$654.42, for the conservative and ~$2,782.86, for the aggressive approach due to the reduction in deposit rates of approximately 10.3 bps and 33.5bps respectively. This does not take into consideration how the market will then adjust after the ETH v3 interst rate parameters are changed. 

# Specification

The following is to be performed:

* Deposit all wETH into aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH)
* Withdraw all awETH (Aave V2 wETH) into ETH
* Withdraw all but 100 aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH) into ETH
* Deposit ETH into RocketPool's rETH
* Transfer rETH into collector

title: ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token
status: WIP
author: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham
created: 21-03-2022

---

# Simple Summary

Acquire 200,000 BAL tokens via a combination of performing a BAL for AAVE token swap. The BAL tokens are to be complemented with ETH and deposited into the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year. The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools, [1].

# Abstract

Perform a token swap with Balancer by exchanging AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve for 200,000 BAL tokens. The exchange rate to be used is the 90-day moving average price when the votes pass on both sides. 

All 200,000 BAL tokens plus the aBAL tokens in the Reserve Factor (redeemed for BAL) are to be paired with sufficient ETH and deposited into the Balancer V2 BAL:ETH (80:20) pool. The veBAL holding will then participate in Balancer's revised tokenomics that commenced on the 28th March. 

Initially, the veBAL will be used to vote BAL rewards to pools which support aTokens that create TVL for Aave and/or AAVE liquidity pools.

# Motivation

Aave and Balance have a long history of working together. The AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drive TVL to Aave markets, [2].

When the AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool is moved to Balancer V2 and integrated into Aave’s Safety Module, the veBAL tokens can be used to vote BAL rewards to the newly created AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V2 pool.

In addition, the veBAL can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [3]. There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using veBAL to vote for BAL rewards to pools that strengthen Aave is a strategic advantage of deploying the BAL tokens into the BAL:ETH pool.

By exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. The token exchange, plus additional acquisition, is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder, based on etherscan BAL holder rankings, [4]. Balancer will become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [5]. Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate.

Aave will likely be one of the first movers in the upcoming BAL wars and will gain a strategic advantage to bootstrap new Balancer Boosted Pools which lead to tokens being deposited in Aave markets to earn yield. This has the benefit of creating TVL and Revenue for Aave.

The initial sizing to acquire 200,000 BAL was something that was reached via discussions with the Balancer community and happens to be the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer token swap, [6].

The initial sizing was also determined by the ability to influence how the BAL emissions are to be distributed. If all BPT from the BAL : ETH pool are converted to veBAL, Aave will receive 3.3% of the 14,500 BAL emission schedule which is equivalent to 478 BAL weekly, or $8,126/week at $17/BAL or $422,552/year. If 100% of the current BPT were deposited into the veBAL contract, the yield is very close to 10%. Other deployments from the Reserve Factor will also earn BAL rewards over time, [7].

With 3.3% of veBAL supply, Aave will determine where 2,680 of the 81,200 BAL tokens are to be distributed each week via the Ethereum mainnet pool gauge. This is equivalent to 5% APR on a $47.40M pool without any compounding or other yield sources like swap fees or yield from Aave markets. This is sufficient to support bootstrapping new liquidity pools that support growing TVL for the Aave community. Given the size of the Aave community investment in the Balancer community, it is reasonable to think that Liquidity Mining Committee may also be voting to allocate a portion of there 14,500 weekly BAL emission to support Balancer Boosted Pools which drive TVL to Aave markets.

# Implementation

The token swap is to be performed by both Balancer and Aave by depositing tokens into a contract like how Tribe DAO swapped TRIBE for INDEX, [8].

The aBAL holding in the Reserve Factor, 1,890 aBAL at the time of writing which will be redeemed for BAL and deployed along with the 200,000 BAL tokens attained via the proposed swap, [9].

Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor from there the BAL and matching amount of ETH will be deployed into the BAL : ETH pool on Balancer V2. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year.

The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools

134,"## Rationale

This VIP proposes a new set of parameters for VAI based on this discussion 1.

## Summary

Increase the steepness of the interest rate curve of VAI to incentivize VAI close to $1.

## Motivation

- Harden the peg by making it expensive to borrow VAI when the VAI price is low.
- Provide a better rate for borrowers when VAI is at $1.

## Specification

Modification of this VIP:
- baseRate: 3% (from 4%)
- floatRate: 4000% (from 225%)

We provide an exemple of the implication of the changes in the forum post.

This VIP doesn’t enable VAI borrowings, this will be enabled in a following VIP contingent to having a significant healthy buffer in the VAI USDT PSM.

## Risk Analysis

- Reduction of earnings if VAI stays at $1
- Increasing the VAI borrow rate might reduce VAI borrowings and TVL

**Domains of Operation + Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**

As Balancer pursues its path for further decentralization, the Balancer Maxis workgroup presents community contributors aligned with the protocol's future and long-term sustainability. Whether proposing and executing innovative ideas, or gatekeeping the ecosystem and helping third-party projects, Maxis were proven to be a key component of Balancer.

Our Q4 proposal is effectively asking veBAL Governance the continuation of this decentralized collaboration group, and reading on previous [Q3 funding post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-18-fund-the-balancer-maxis-for-q3/3279) might bring some additional context to the present proposal.The following will be kept brief and at a high level with some reflections on Q3 and the path ahead of us. More granular metrics can be found in our monthly updates for [July](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-july-2022-update/3524), [August](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-august-2022-update/3638), and [September](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-september-update/3746).

*Multisig Management*

* Linear (boosted) pool settings
* Swap fee and amplification adjustments
* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL
* Adding new reward tokens to gauges
* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees
* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig
* Together with Balancer Labs we operate the Emergency subDAO Multisig

These are some of the basic functions required to ensure smooth operation of the Balancer Protocol for all its end users. We believe the best metric for success is that most users are not even aware that these tasks exist – they simply observe a new gauge being approved by voters then appearing on the voting list or find protocol fees in the claim section every week, etc. The Maxis ensure that the various multisigs and their relevant functions are used properly and promptly, and all transactions are verified for accuracy by at least two people. Our Q3 [track record](https://www.notion.so/Gauge-Creation-f3fb316c53724976a1d1da9c31265dbd) in this regard is excellent and we’ll continue in the same manner for Q4.

*Governance*

* We serve on the [Governance Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp/2324) and ensure continuity of Balancer’s Governance Process
* Active participants in Discord and the Forum on governance topics
* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)
* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process
* Manage admin of the Governance Forum
* We will pursue various strategic initiatives (such as BIP-19) at our discretion, either individually or as a group.
* In the cases that voting power in other protocols from tokens held in Balancer’s Treasury has been delegated to us, we will represent Balancer’s interest in these votes.

During Q3 Balancer governance was exceptionally busy. The Maxis ensured that proposals were put up for a vote according to the schedule in BIP-9 and followed through on execution of each approved vote. It is a testament to the resiliency of Balancer’s governance process that despite many proposals and long forum threads, the process of proposing, voting, and implementation continued unhindered. We believe active governance is a good thing for Balancer – we will continue to make proposals, engage in constructive dialogue, and represent Balancer’s interests both on our home forum and elsewhere.

*User/project support*

* We manage Balancer’s Discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed
* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions
* We often deploy new pools for other projects
* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists
* We help with UI testing for Balancer

The Maxis are involved in many chats with many projects seeking to use Balancer in some way. There are several success stories worth highlighting during Q3, perhaps most notably being the close relationship with Hidden Hand as a result of BIP-19. We continue to be in regular contact to ensure smooth operation of Balancer’s markets, and they even deployed to Optimism to support our growth there. Rocket Pool deciding to begin incentivizing Balancer liquidity is also a major milestone in Balancer’s push for yield bearing liquidity. During Q4 the Maxis plan to continue supporting projects and users, so they can have a positive and productive experience with Balancer.

The final point on UI testing is also worth highlighting. It is often a thankless job, but Zekraken leads the weekly testing effort and doesn’t compromise or cut corners. Not all heroes wear capes.

*Community*

* We manage a monthly Coordinape circle, open to all DAO contributors
* Onboarding framework for new contributors
* Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO or between SPs
* Regular health-check on SP and community contributors with recurrent feedback
* Study groups to invest in contributors growth

Having an open community for new contributors wanting to join the Balancer ecosystem is a great concern for us. By adopting an easy and seamless onboarding framework, every applicant is being reached through discovery calls and monthly follow-ups. We help contributors understand the DAO operating framework (BIP-1) and set in motion their ideas for Balancer. By keeping contributors engaged, we aim to retain talents in the Balancer ecosystem as Ballers, Grantees or shaping their own Service Provider.

*Record Keeping*

* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.
* Maintaining, updating, and improving official Balancer documentation as a bridge between the greater community and core development team.

**Length of Engagement & Budget:**

3 months.

Budget of 9,350 BAL per month for salaries (1,700 per person, Danko at 850) which will be max locked in veBAL by contributors. This represents $10k/mo for each contributor (Danko at half) at today’s BAL price (~$6). Additional monthly allocations of 100 BAL for gas costs and 4,000 BAL for Coordinape.

Total for 3 month engagement: **40,350 BAL**

Impact on the Treasury: The Treasury currently holds ~5M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q4 would cost around 0.8% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~3.2% of the treasury’s BAL.

title: [ARFC] USDT Risk Parameters Update Aave V3 ETH Pool
author: Marc Zeller, Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
date: 2023-06-06
---

## Abstract

This ARFC proposes an update to the risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, enabling it as collateral.

## Motivation

This proposal aims to unlock the potential of USDT as collateral within the Aave ETH V3 pool. By aligning the risk parameters of USDT with those of USDC, we anticipate an increase in borrowing power for users. This change is expected to stimulate borrowing volume on Aave, thereby contributing to the protocol's revenue. The activation of collateral power for USDT is a strategic move towards creating a more dynamic, efficient, and profitable liquidity environment within the Aave ETH V3 pool.

## Specification

The following table outlines the proposed risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, which will replicate the risk parameters of USDC:

139,"# Overview

This is a proposal to provide Balancer DAO with an automated way to collect the fees that the protocol has earned from its different layers, convert and bridge them if needed. Therefore, later on, an authorized party can withdraw and distribute them as bribes, to the DAO and to veBAL holders. The goal is to ensure that protocol fee collecting process is fully trustless and automated.

# 1. About Mimic

Mimic is a platform that allows you to deploy tailored infrastructure to automate (and/or delegate) access to DeFi, in a secure and 100% non-custodial way. Mimic is especially suitable to replace and speed up manual and centralized tasks while tracking and monitoring every detail. This is achieved through our innovative **Smart Vaults** concept: an automated and trustless solution that can be customized to suit your operation needs.

Deploying a Smart Vault is simple. We only need to figure out the best configuration that suits your needs and customize one for you. Moreover, Mimic provides you with lots of multi-layer flexibility, it can be easily scaled up by deploying and connecting additional Smart Vaults.

Our team members have a large experience in blockchain and especially in DeFi protocols. We have previously worked for many well-known projects like Aave, Balancer, Open Zeppelin, Aragon, POAP and The Graph.

# 2. Background

Currently Balancer DAO collects protocol fees in three layers: Mainnet, Polygon and Arbitrum:

Mainnet: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F

Polygon: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F

Arbitrum: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F

As documented in [[BIP-19] Incentivize Core Pools & L2 Usage](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329):

- All fees earned on Polygon & Arbitrum are used as bribes for core pools on those networks, weighted proportionally by TVL of those core pools - after the DAO takes its 25%.
- All fees earned by Ethereum core pools are used as bribes on those pools (each pool gets its own fees as a bribe), after the DAO takes its 25%.
- All fees earned by Ethereum non-core pools are sent to veBAL and the DAO (75/25 split).
- Protocol fee collection, distribution, and any subsequent bribing take place every two weeks on Monday instead of weekly on Wednesday.
- All fees earned are converted to USDC, except BAL and BAL-like assets which are converted to BAL
- All bribes are paid in USDC

# 3. Core Proposal

Our proposal is to provide Balancer DAO with a **solution to automate** how it collects and distributes its protocol fees. To accomplished this, Mimic will deploy three customized Smart Vaults owned by Balancer DAO, one on each layer.

All Smart Vaults will only be allowed to collect earned fees when they reach a pre-determined value in USDC. If fees collected are BAL-like assets they will be converted to BAL, otherwise they will be converted to USDC. Both Polygon and Arbitrum Smart Vaults will bridge all USDC and BAL accumulated to the Mainnet Smart Vault every two weeks (one period).

Finally, an authorized manager can withdraw those collected tokens from Mainnet Smart Vault to distribute them accordingly as bribes, to the DAO and to veBAL holders.

Also, it is important to mention that at all times the DAO has full ownership and control of all three Smart Vault’s assets. This means that, for example, at any moment it can remove permissions to execute an action or withdraw any asset by itself.

# 4. Technical Specification

There will be three Smart Vaults. One deployed in Mainnet, another in Polygon and the last one in Arbitrum. All Smart Vaults will have a single owner who has full control over them at all times. 

Each Smart Vault will be configured with a series of predefined actions, some of those will be automatically executed by Mimic network of bots and others manually by an authorized manager that Balancer DAO designates. Those actions are:

- **Gather and convert to USDC:** Gathers assets (expect from BAL and BAL-like assets) from Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector and swaps them to USDC (except from USDC itself).
- **Gather and convert to BAL:** Gathers BAL and BAL-like assets from Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector and swaps them to BAL (except from BAL itself).
- **Bridge:** Bridges USDC and BAL to Mainnet every two weeks.
- **Withdraw:** Withdraws any asset to an external wallet configured by the owner.

Note that all this behavior will be enforced by smart contracts code, actions won’t be allowed to perform any further logic.

In case external conditions change, the deployed infrastructure can be adjusted as necessary on an ongoing basis to reach the endowment’s objectives. Smart Vaults provide full flexibility to add new allow-listed actions, change permissions or incorporate new strategies.

# 5. Operational details

## 5.1. Reporting

Mimic offers a reporting site where users can follow all their Smart Vaults activity. Mimic also supports subscribing to a notifications service that can be easily integrated with some chat rooms like Discord. Additionally, users can subscribe to be notified with periodic reports that will be emitted by Mimic automatically. 

## 5.2. Maintenance

Mimic will be in charge of monitoring the Smart Vaults on a daily basis, making sure the reporting tools are kept up-to-date accordingly. Additionally, Mimic will make use of its own bots infrastructure to execute the automated actions when needed. 

In case a critical report is received, Mimic will act immediately in order to assess its severity and act accordingly. In case Smart Vaults assets are at risk, Mimic team will get in touch with the trusted committee either to pause the Smart Vaults operations until it can be migrated to a new implementation with the corresponding fixes.

## 5.3. Fees

Mimic will charge a 2% fee of the assets that are processed through the Smart Vaults with a 5K USD cap for every period of execution (two weeks).

## 5.4. Termination

As mentioned before Balancer DAO will be in full control of its Smart Vaults and the funds that were deposited into them. This means Balancer DAO is allowed to exit at any point in time. Neither Mimic nor anyone else, unless it was previously allowed by the Balancer DAO, will be never in control of those funds.

# 6. Timeline

Once the final details of the Balancer Smart Vaults are finalized, the Mimic team will take full responsibility to set up the required automated actions. Mimic already counts with infrastructure to deploy and test Smart Vaults that can be applied for this use case.

Assuming the proposed investment strategies and automated actions are accepted by Balancer DAO, setting three Smart Vaults for it shouldn’t take longer than a month. After that, we will schedule an audit process for the configuration before the deployment which shouldn’t take more than two weeks.

143,"#### ABSTRACT

After the vote against AIP-4&5, the community had meaningful discussions on the ApeCoin DAO forum and elsewhere. The essential feedback was that overall the framework was fine, but lacked the key element of caps.

This AIP proposes a staking system for ApeCoin and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT ecosystem: Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC). Staking participants will be able to stake ApeCoin and use the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem NFTs to receive ApeCoin from a preset pool over a set period of time.

145,"This proposal is a continuation of the topic from VIP-51. Previously, several VRT Swap & XVS Vesting architecture designs were proposed that differed from the original design summarized in the Venus Tokenomics 2 published in August of 2021. One of these alternative designs, referred to as “fixed speed vesting” proposed a vesting schedule that would have allowed all XVS to vest very quickly if VRT was separated into a multitude of accounts and deposited separately. This potential workaround required a countermeasure in the form of a global daily limit on all deposits. Many in the community pointed out concerns regarding this daily limit from a technical and user experience perspective.

We considered feedback regarding the daily limit and how this unfairly allows those with bots to consume the daily quota before everyone else each day. There is no technically feasible way to prevent this issue with the fixed speed model, so we are proposing deployment of the original swap & vesting design.

Check out the full details of the proposal here: https://community.venus.io/t/vip-52-vrt-swap-xvs-vesting/2378

The Vote will consist of these three different options:

**TL;DR**: Introduce an amendment to the Uniswap V3 Factory owner to allow the DAO to make future changes to the fee mechanism. This will prevent the DAO from being pigeonholed by a singular, immutable implementation, thereby enabling further experimentation and allowing the DAO to effectively respond to issues with the current setup.

To not significantly slow down the current process proposed by the Foundation, this Snapshot poll will be used to collect opinions via a vote from the delegates. There will be two options, “Accept amendment” or “Reject amendment.” If the “Accept amendment” is able to demonstrate a significant majority, then we would expect the onchain proposal put forth by the Foundation to include the change.

Title: [ARFC] Polygon v2 Borrow Rate Adjustments
Author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic & @ChaosLabs 
Created: 2024-04-04

---

# Summary

This publication proposes gradually revising the Borrow Rate on Polygon v2 to provide further encouragement for users to migrate to Aave v3.

# Motivation

Over the last [8 months](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/284/) the Reserve Factor (RF) on Polygon v2 has gradually increased from as low as 21.00% to 99.99%. As a result, deposit yield converged to zero and the capital efficiency of Aave v2 has been reduced on Polygon.

With the RF now approaching the maximum across all reserves, this publication seek to gradually increase the cost of capital via periodic borrow rate adjustments, every two weeks in a predictable fashion.

Based upon recent borrow rates behaviour, the market has demonstrated the ability to withstand periods of elevated borrowing rates. 

## Non Frozen Assets

For non-frozen assets, this proposal recommends increasing the Slope1 parameter by 75bps every two weeks, or 1.5% per month, to encourage further migration of users from v2 to v3. The outcome of this [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe2dd228640c3cad93f5418c40c4b5743b3c6c85aa0aae9eee53cbdbca2ed5c2d) has been taken into consideration when drafting the current IR parameters included in this proposal.

The Slope2 parameter is to be revised to discourage utilisation exceeding the Uoptimal value. Note, several reserves are experiencing utilisation marginally exceeding Uoptimal. 

As utilisation of each reserve decreases over time, the Uoptimal will be periodically lowered to discourage new debt positions emerging. Any proposed changes to the Uoptimal parameter will be presented via a separate ARFC. 

Upon implementation, this change will not trigger liquidation of any users funds and will gradually increase the cost for users who remain on v2. Please note, there is a Migration Tool that was developed by BGD to aid users migrating from v2 to v3. 

Assets in scope: DAI, MATIC, wBTC, wETH, USDC and USDT.

## Frozen Assets

Each frozen reserve contains a small portion of funds with a very minimal amount of debt. For these assets we recommend a more aggressive implementation: reduce the Uoptimal to 10.00%, revise Slope1 to 50.00% and Slope2 to 500.00% - with  the exception of BAL, which receives a Uoptimal of 20% due to current utilisation being around 15%.

Assets in scope: BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK and SUSHI.

# Specification

The following parameters are to be updated as follows:

| Asset | Current Slope1 | Proposed Slope1 | Current Uoptimal | Proposed Uoptimal | Current Slope2 | Proposed Slope2 |
| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---:  |   :---:   |

| LINK  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 402.00% | 500.00% |
| USDT  | 12.00% | 12.75% | 52.00% | 52.00% | 236.00% |   236.00% |
| wBTC  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 37.00% | 37.00% | 536.00% |   536.00% |
| wETH  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 40.00% | 40.00% | 167.00% |   200.00% |
| wMATIC|  6.00% |  6.75% | 48.00% | 48.00% | 440.00% |   500.00% |
| wUSDC | 12.00% | 12.75% | 77.00% | 77.00% | 134.00% |   200.00% |

Subject to approval from @ChaosLabs, a subsequent proposal will be submitted every two weeks.

154,"First, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to farms – the per block allocation to Farms and Lottery will remain at [**3.75 CAKE/block**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/Qme8aLLxh7UeAmiAxcUie7FWvSrBYdmNMFtHhGdMTFEFKX).

Importantly, the purpose of these proposals is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. In other words, redistributing farm rewards from the farms mentioned below will boost APRs for all other farms.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more capacity to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

This is a proposal to allocate some small portion of the Balancer ecosystem grant fund toward public goods.

We developers and community members of the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement recognize that, more often than not, we stand on the shoulders of giants. Decentralized Finance (DeFi), as well as the wider Ethereum and cryptoasset ecosystem, is a group effort and we can all do our part to make this technological revolution a reality. As a core building block within DeFi, the Balancer protocol directly benefits from any and all growth within the DeFi economy. As such, it would behoove us all to give back to the community that has enabled Balancer’s unparalleled growth over the last several months. Let’s help plant the seeds for some of next big Ethereum projects.

[Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/?) Round 7 began three days ago on September 15 and will run until October 2. Let’s get this proposal passed this weekend so that the Balancer community can become a matching partner for this round!

The following are the proposed options for a lump sum public goods contribution to Gitcoin Grants Round 7. The BAL tokens to be donated will be taken from the Balancer ecosystem grant fund.

THX Network requests to whitelist its Gnosis Safe multisig address to enable it to lock B-80BAL-20WETH into veBAL and participate in governance and gauge voting.

# Motivation

THX Network allows creators and communities to create and embed ERC20 and ERC721 tokens in their platforms and social channels. The project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under agreement No 82888 (Blockpool) and No 824509 (Block.IS).

$THX is the project’s governance token launched in dec. 2021 using a Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) and has its main source of liquidity on Balancer’s Polygon deployment (~$900k TVL).

Our emerging DAO is about to diversify its treasury into $BAL and participate in Balancer’s governance.

**The Proposal**

The DEXG liquidity on Balancer surpassed >3$M with a total liquidity of $3.8M currently pooled. Therefore we propose to increase the capFactor from cap1 to cap2.

**What is DEXG?**

DEXG is the governance token of the DEXToken Protocol. The DEXToken Protocol creates a unique DeFi infrastructure, featuring a revolutionary AMM and utilising the off-chain capabilities of the Flowchain IoT network.

163,"##### ABSTRACT
This AIP aims to build Apecoin DAO smart contract Wallets for GameFi NFts and establish a Lend assets & rewarding vault for the Game community.

Apecoin DAO Wallets wanted to implement active user engagement in a Game community by enabling GameFi Segment with the DAO and smart contract Wallets. With the rise of NFT-based P2E games, it’s crucial to build a community-driven ecosystem for NFT assets management in order to effectively rotate the assets among the active community members to Maximize the NFT DEFI potential.

DAO wallets are structured to exclusively enable active wallets to retain assets for continued participation in the game. On inactivity, The DAO will conduct votes on idle assets to withdraw them from the member wallet into the assets vault, reallocating them to other members. This approach increases NFT scarcity and price in the market which will eventually attract more buyers and investment in the DAO-driven community. Furthermore, the DAO will offer incentives to participating voters, creating a constructive cycle of engagement.

All the DAO processes will run on a predefined set of rules to streamline community governance. Seamless management of NFT assets through the DAO platform sustains the blockchain-based games ecosystem.

DZAR can print unlimited amounts of tokens at their sole discretion.

DZAR gets pooled in many 8 asset pools. These pools are as safe as the weakest currency, DZAR going to 0 will drain these pools to 0. There are millions in these pools. If DZAR prints unlimited amount of tokens, it will drain all these pools, generate large losses and bad publicity.

168,"**Summary:**

A proposal by the Mechanism.Capital 13 team to create a Curve Metapool for Empty Set Dollar (ESD) and the 3Pool stablecoins (USDC, USDT, and DAI).

ESD has been one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins launched to date. Its market capitalization has grown to over $65 million in the ~2 months since its inception (peaked near $100 million).

The unique mechanism design of the protocol makes it a strong candidate to become one of the largest stable collateral assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

Creating an ESD metapool would attract more liquidity to the Curve platform and lead to increased trading fees.

Learn more about metapools here: https://resources.curve.fi/faq/base-and-metapools 1

**Abstract:**

Empty Set Dollar (ESD) is a new algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin that utilizes fixed protocol rules on supply expansion as well as a unique coupon creation + redemption model to incentivize trustless coordination between selfish participants that maintain ESD’s synthetic peg 1:1 with the US dollar all on-chain. Unlike other algorithmic stable coins like AMPL, ESD does not rebase all balances using non-standard functions, but instead adjusts supply through other mechanisms, allowing ESD to have the same composability as other standard ERC20 tokens.

Currently, crypto lacks a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoin. While DAI and sUSD come close, they currently have vulnerabilities in their architecture. The goal of ESD is to create a truly permissionless, scaleable, stable store of value, that can be used as superfluid collateral in DeFi.

Note: ESD currently only incentivizes the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool. In order to motivate more liquidity to flow to this Curve metapool, ESD holders would have to vote to upgrade ESD to incentivize this new pool. However, various ESD community members have already expressed their support for such a prospective proposal to reward Curve LPs.

*Liquidity:*

Total Uniswap Liquidity as of 11/3/2020: $1.52 million

Avg. Daily Trading Volume (Last 14 Days ended 11/3/2020): $3.75 million

*Token Holder Distribution:*

As of 11/4/2020 there are currently over 853 unique addresses holding ESD. This includes 668 staked addresses.

Over 90% of ESD tokens were staked to the DAO as of 11/3/2020.

**Motivation:**

This is an opportunity for Curve to attract more liquidity to its platform and increase trading fees. It would also benefit the ESD community by increasing the efficiency of ESD turnover and accelerating ESD contraction & expansion cycles to further stabilize the price of the token around $1. Finally, accelerating the growth of ESD would enhance the antifragility of the entire DeFi ecosystem due to ESD’s unique characteristics relative to other stable assets.

**Specification:**

This metapool would include ESD, USDC, USDT, and DAI. It is likely that the ESD protocol community would vote to incentivize this Curve metapool. It already does this for the ESD/USDC pool on Uniswap: https://emptyset.finance/#/pool/

**For:**

This pool would bring more liquidity and fees to the Curve protocol.

It would also help accelerate and dampen the volatility ESD’s expansion/contraction cycles, which are currently delayed due to the limitations of slippage on the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool.

Successful passage of this proposal would show the Curve community’s willingness to support new, innovative protocols – specifically those focused on open and permissionless access to DeFi.

**Against:**

ESD is a relatively new and experimental protocol. There are both known and unknown risks to explore as the protocol matures. These include, but are not limited to:

ESD is expected to trade within a narrow band around US$1.00, but has experienced short periods of significant volatility

A downward spiral in the instance of zero demand for new coupons (though in the current contraction period, over 26m coupons have been purchased)

Smart contract bugs (code is currently under audit); and

A design flaw that leads to an economic attack (see the recent Harvest Finance attack 1).

**Title:** [ARFC] Onboard osETH to Aave V3 on Ethereum 
**Author:** ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-03-11

---
## Summary

This is a ARFC proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s new over-collateralized staked ETH token, osETH, on AAVE V3 Ethereum.

## Motivation

Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) have proven to be popular collateral assets on Aave, with Lido’s stETH the largest Reserve across all Aave deployments and rETH quickly reaching its supply caps. As productive assets, LSTs are high quality collateral to borrow against. Given their high correlation to ETH, LSTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.

osETH in particular is overcollateralized by design, providing in-built slashing protection and consequently an increased level of protection for the Aave protocol…

As StakeWise V3 provides solo stakers to ability to mint osETH against their own nodes, on-boarding osETH will benefit Aave, StakeWise, and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, and be an important step in the pursuit to diversify Ethereum staking and encourage staking from home.

The onboarding of osETH will consequently create increased osETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and StakeWise protocols, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of osETH.

## Chain to be deployed/listed

171,"The proposal is to switch Badger rewards from Boosted to Pro-rata on the Badger Locked CVX Sett with the open launch this week, and stop counting the blCVX deposits as the non-native balance in the Boost calculation.

This would mean that all depositors would be receiving the same APR in both Badger and cvxCRV emissions that are allocated to the Sett.

With blCVX not being counted as non-native balance, Sett depositors would still be able to utilize their Boost power on other non-native Setts, while getting the Badger & bcvxCRV bonus from being in blCVX. 
And it would also make the Sett more attractive for users with smaller Stake Ratios and to new depositors, all while ensuring that the DAO gets as much CVX voting power as possible to vote on Bitcoin pools rewards on Curve+Convex.

### Goal of the vote
This poll is to utilize Snapshot's ""Voter Privacy"" setting for use in future off-chain snapshot votes. (Disclaimer: voter privacy is turned on for this Snapshot temporarily as a POC and will be reverted if this vote does not pass)

### Context
Snapshot proposals are currently used to gauge community sentiment on serious topics under consideration for onchain governance votes that impact 0x protocol.

Currently, snapshot votes use the default voting privacy setting which shows the result of an ongoing poll in real time. As of October 2022, Snapshot integrated with ShutterDAO to enable an opt-in voting privacy setting which will encrypt votes while the poll is live and only review the result when the voting period is over.

### Why Opt-in to Voting Privacy?
While 1 token 1 vote has made participating in governance easier, there are some major shortcomings to it as talked about by prominent people within the blockchain space Vitalik (1, 2, 3). Highlighting two of the problems here are (1) plutarchy, or the ability for wealth/capital to heavily influence vote results, (2) bribery & collusion, or the ability for highly coordinated individuals/groups to heavily influence vote results. As a consequence of suboptimal governance, we also see (3) voter apathy or low participation.

While Opting into voting privacy does not solve all of these problems completely, I think that it would be a meaningful experiment and be a step in the right direction. In terms of how hiding the current result of a vote while it is still live could address each of those three problems above specifically

1. Plutarchy - increases the cost for an attacker to influence the result since it’s not clear how many votes they’d need to get their preferred outcome.
2. Bribery & Collusion - reduce strategic voting for non-basic voting systems (i.e. rank-based where people might not vote truthfully if it increases the change of their preferred option winning)
3. Voter Apathy - reduce the feeling that a vote doesn’t matter since it’s unclear what the current tally is

177,"# Summary

This proposal seeks to gather Balancer community support and approval for Solace DAO to launch and operate a new Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora chain, an EVM within the NEAR ecosystem. This newly deployed protocol will be called Holdr, with the governance token HLDR, and ultimately governed by Holdr DAO.

# Abstract

If approved, this proposal will result in:

- Solace DAO launching Holdr as an officially recognized Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora
- Balancer DAO Treasury receiving 4% of HLDR total supply
- BAL tokenholders receiving 1% of HLDR total supply
- Solace DAO and Balancer DAO research and co-marketing collaboration

# Preface

This proposal is shared by Solace’s team and was written by Nikita Buzov (founder). Solace has received a grant of $20,000-worth of AURORA tokens from Aurora to pursue this proposal and launch a Balancer V2 friendly fork. Also, back in summer 2021, Solace DAO has also received a NEAR grant worth of $30,000 from NEAR Foundation to develop Solace, a DeFi Insurance protocol (live across Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Aurora). Therefore, Solace has been well supported and integrated within the NEAR ecosystem community, which, along with successful experience operating DeFi protocols, makes Solace team a natural partner within the Aurora’s and NEAR’s ecosystems.

# Motivation

Both NEAR and Aurora ecosystems have been steadily growing and developing their unique technology. Over the years they have shown a strong commitment to innovation and user experience, developer community, as well as security! Because of this continued growth, Solace is excited to support their ecosystem and, together with Aurora, identified a need for Balancer V2 technology to become present there.

# Background

Solace is a DeFi insurance protocol, founded back in 2020 and first launched in 2021 on Ethereum, later expanding to Polygon, Fantom, and Aurora. Over the past years Solace team has been awarded grants from Polygon, Aave, NEAR, Celer, and Aurora, following successful completion of the specified goals. Additionally Solace DAO has been funded through a seed round in 2021 (raised $1.1M). The team has displayed over time a great track-record of shipping products, developing and setting up complex architectures, operating protocols on multiple chains. Solace’s team is currently composed of 10 people: 5 engineers, 1 UI/UX designer, 2 BD & marketing, 1 operations, 1 founder (also an engineer).

# Specification

Solace is set to launch Balancer V2 fork in the most current production deployment, including all the core technology. With security in mind, Solace will not make any changes or updates (unless explicitly requested by Balancer DAO, or an emergency response to a verified vulnerability is required) to the core smart contracts. This work has been complete and the contracts are live in production. I invite you to check and verify both the application and the deployed contracts following these links:

- Website (access the app through the link on there): https://holdr.fi/
- Smart contracts: [https://holdr.gitbook.io/holdr-protocol-overview/developers/deployment-addresses](https://holdr.gitbook.io/holdr-protocol-overview/developers/deployment-addresses)

Please note that LBP UI and the Bribe market functionality are still in development, but should be completed in the following weeks, ahead of the HLDR token launch (tentatively scheduled for December'22).

Holdr will also follow the exact same governance process and tokenomics design as veBAL, locking 80/20 HLDR/wNEAR BPT with a max period of 1 year to control the HLDR liquidity mining emissions across gauges.

# HLDR Supply and Distribution

The total supply of HLDR will be 100,000,000 HLDR tokens and distributed through the following allocations and schedules:

## 5% - Balancer

A portion of the Holdr protocol should be owned by both the Balancer’s treasury and BAL holders. This would be following a standard set by a previous Balancer friendly fork, Beethoven X. We propose, in a similar fashion, that 5% of the total supply of HLDR should be allocated as follows:

- 4% provided to the Balancer DAO Treasury (2y linear vesting, 6mo cliff).
- 1% provided as an airdrop to BAL holders as follows:
    - A backdated snapshot will be taken for all BAL holders
    - Only holders with a BAL value greater than $100 USD will be eligible
    - A 2x multiplier will be assigned to BAL and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders, including the holders of veBAL locking their BPTs, on Ethereum
    - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Arbitrum BAL and BAL/ETH 60/40 BPT holders
    - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Polygon BAL, USDC/MATIC/WETH/BAL 25/25/25/25 BPT, and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders.

To achieve a more equitable distribution of the airdrop tokens, they will be distributed based on the weights above, not based on the USD value of the holdings. Note, any qualifying address will need to have a Holdr LP position, worth at least $100, staked in incentivized liquidity mining. A snapshot date will be announced within a month after the launch, if this vote is passes. The distribution mechanism of the tokens will be defined collaboratively between the Solace team and the Balancer community and the requirements outlined here are subject to small revisions.

## 15% - Solace DAO

This allocation will be awarded across Solace DAO, Solace Launch DAO, and the active team members to compensate for the on-going work and to support Holdr protocol operations. The distribution will happen on a 2 year linear vesting schedule with a 6-month cliff.

## 15% - Holdr DAO Treasury

The Holdr DAO will be formed overtime by the community and will inherit this treasury to govern and financially support any future developments, grants, contributor compensations, etc. Solace team’s goal over the next couple of years will be to pass on the governance as the Holdr DAO matures. This treasury will be be vesting linearly for 5 years, with a 1-year cliff.

## 14.125% - Ecosystem Partners & Investors

This allocations will be utilized to effectively partner with various protocols within NEAR and Aurora ecosystems, as well as to raise some capital to finance any operational costs. Vesting will follow a linear schedule of 2 years, with a 6-month cliff, similar to the Balancer DAO and Solace DAO allocation.

## 2% - HLDR Liquidity Bootstrapping

These funds will be used to seed and launch HLDR token using Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool.

## 48.875% - Liquidity Mining Emissions

Similar to Balancer’s schedule, Holdr will adopt emissions halving every 4 years. The initial emissions rate will start at 150,000 HLDR/wk.

# Friendly Fork Agreement

If accepted by the Governance process of both DAOs, this friendly fork will start effective immediately. There is no expiry date to the agreement; however, both DAOs can override this Friendly Fork agreement through their governance process to remove the Friendly Fork title with a one-month notice period. If such decision passes a vote, Balancer DAO will loose claim to all unvested HLDR tokens granted to their DAO Treasury.",bullish

**Protocol Description:**
Olympus is building OHM, a community-owned, decentralized and censorship-resistant reserve currency that is asset-backed, deeply liquid and used widely across Web3.

**Motivation:**
As part of the Olympus RBS launch, the OHM-DAI-ETH pool has been equally split into two new pools, OHM-DAI & OHM-ETH as to simplify the conduction of  market operations by the Olympus Treasury under this new Range-Bound System. Since migrating the bulk its liquidity onto Balancer, the OHM pool has been one of the top pools in terms of volume generated, greatly contributing to the total revenues accruing to veBAL holders. Olympus DAO would like to explore different ways to attract additional and/or external liquidity for these two pools by enabling gauges. The gauge for the OHM-DAI-ETH pool should also be disabled as the Olympus Treasury is expecting to migrate fully out of it in the coming days. 

**Specifications:**
1. OlympusDAO is currently using snapshot for Governance: [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/olympusdao.eth)

title: Add stETH to Aave V2
status: ARC posted, pending snapshot vote
author: Jbeezy (@jbeezy1)
shortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for stETH
ARC discussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-steth-lido/5793/6
created: 2021-10-18
updated: N/A
---

## Simple Summary

Lido allows users to earn staking rewards on the Ethereum beacon chain without locking Ether or maintaining staking infrastructure. This is done through the stETH token. stETH tokens represent a tokenized staking deposit and can be held, traded, or sold.

Full ARC and discussion can be viewed here: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-steth-lido/5793

Proposed voting choices:
1. Yes: Add stETH as proposed (no borrowing)
2. No: Do not add stETH

## Abstract

There is strong interest in using stETH to earn additional yield without taking a lot of risk. This is evident through the growth of the stETH/ETH pool on Curve Finance, which has become the most liquid pool on Curve with a liquidity of $3.8 billion.

The addition of stETH on to Aave can work to attract a larger audience to both Aave and Lido. More ETH staked with Lido would subsequently benefit the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network, to the benefit of the community as a whole. stETH would likely bring new borrow demand to Aave as market participants look to borrow against their staked ETH or lend their stETH for a yield.

We want people who want to be responsibly long ETH (i.e. via taking leverage on AAVE) to be able to put some extra staking rewards on top.

## Motivation

stETH as DeFi collateral is beneficial for a number of reasons:

- stETH is almost as safe as ETH, price-wise: barring catastrophic scenarios, its value tends to hold the ETH peg well;
- stETH is a productive asset. Earning rewards on collateral effectively lowers the cost of borrowing. This could make borrowing more attractive on Aave and help to increase market utilization (and therefore Aave’s protocol revenue from stablecoin reserve factors).
- stETH is a very liquid asset with over $3.8 billion in liquidity locked in the Curve stETH/ETH pool.

## Proposed Risk Parameters
These have been modified since the last proposal. The reasons are described below. Generally, the functions of stETH have held consistent during growth and market volatility.

LTV: 70%
Liquidation Threshold: 75%
Liquidation Bonus: 7.5%
Reserve Factor: 10%

A LTV of 70% is higher than the 56% average LTV across non-stablecoin assets and 10% lower than ETH’s 80% LTV. This gives the protocol more room to safely liquidate stETH with a volatility profile similar to ETH.

Interest Rate Model (we plan to not have stETH borrowing available initially):

UOptimal: 60%
Base: 0%
Slope 1: 8%
Slope 2: 200%

As stETH is more suited as collateral instead of a borrowing asset we adjusted the utilization rate to 60% and doubled slope 2 in order to safe guard enough liquidity in the event of market consolidation and liquidation events.

stETH liquidity and risk considerations

- stETH inherits all of ETH’s market risk, so they should be considered together for the purpose of evaluating market risk
- stETH value is defined and backed by the value of Ether and expectations on the beacon chain withdrawals timeline. As the expected merge gets closer, stETH risk will drop down significantly.
- stETH is one of the most liquid tokens in crypto with low exchange volumes and extremely high liquidity
- stETH liquidity is ensured by Lido’s strategy incentivizing a consistent stETH peg

# Summary

This proposal is for the funding of the Balancer Foundation for year two. The year one Foundation budget started in FY22 Q2 to account for its earlier incorporation, as a result the renewal falls earlier than most other funding cycles.

As a recap, the Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work in a decentralized environment, and supports resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.

The Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate

It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts.

The Foundation and its operating subsidiary act as facilitators of the Balancer Ecosystem. This governance structure, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, the front-end team or other technology providers.

In short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the DAO and part of the DAO’s governance within the structure of the traditional business world. The Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.

As we are all aware, running a Foundation Company comes with certain real-world costs and financial reserve requirements. These are laid out below. For more detail, please refer to the initial funding proposal for the Foundation.

The budget identified for the Foundation is line-item specific and includes very few estimates. The Foundation has, however, assisted in achieving meaningful savings elsewhere in the ecosystem, as shared with the community [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-foundation-and-balancer-opco-cost-update-to-the-balancer-community-march-2023/4556).

The Foundation’s independent Cayman director reviewed these projections in comparison with a number of foundations similar in nature to the Balancer Foundation, and sees the Balancer Foundation achieving a material cost saving overall with its proposed figures.

## Specification - Foundation expenses and reserves

This proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2023 running through March 2024. This proposal does not request any change to the self-insurance reserve, currently covered by the approval of [BIP-198](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-198-creation-of-ecosystem-council-and-amended-self-insurance-fund/4409).

### Foundation Expenses

The summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, if approved, we propose that FY23 Q2 be funded from funds already held by Balancer OpCo due to savings achieved there, rather than additional funding from the DAO. Thereafter, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.

The Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, and one will see annual fees due around December/January that lead to higher funding needs in those quarters. This is the first funding cycle where four full quarters are budgeted. The other proposed changes from the previous budget are: timing of Cayman director fees aligning with the full calendar year per contract terms - this is a reset year and should only happen once; and a slight increase in allowance for legal counsel to deal with certain corporate administration matters and from a budgetary prudence perspective. The Foundation has no BAL requirements.

1. Q2 FY23 - USDC 99,094 - we propose this quarter is funded from existing reserves due to savings at the operating subsidiary.
2. Q3 FY23 - USDC 59,219 - for transfer 25 June 2023
3. Q4 FY23 - USDC 69,634 - for transfer 25 September 2023
4. Q1 FY24 - USDC 105,344 - for transfer 15 December 2023

The table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter.

# Paragraph summary
We would like to ask for your support in listing RSR (Reserve Rights Token) as an asset to borrow. RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both (a) insures and (b) governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol.

# Motivation
The Reserve team is launching the Reserve protocol in fall of 2022. From that point on, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token will serve the purpose of (a) insuring and (b) governing stablecoins created on the Reserve protocol (RTokens).

The Reserve protocol [GitHub - reserve-protocol/protocol](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/) is building on Aave by (a) integrating aTokens as collateral and (b) using the protocol oracle to determine price during valuation and auction functions (if listed on Aave as borrowable asset).

We would prefer to use the Aave oracles for the simplicity of our protocol’s design and the code has already been included in our ongoing audit. To do so, this requires RSR to be a borrowable asset on Aave.

When RSR is staked on a particular Reserve stablecoin (RToken), it may receive a portion of income from the respective RToken’s full collateral basket. Because of this, we anticipate demand to borrow RSR in order to stake or hedge staked positions. Aave would be the only platform where this would be possible as of now.

# Specifications
## Link between the author & the project: 
The Reserve team
## High level overview of the project: 
The mission of the Reserve project is to help people cope with the effects of high- or hyperinflation and aims to eventually eradicate it. The project does this by developing (a) stable+(**) cryptocurrencies, (b) a mobile application to exchange local currencies with the stable+ cryptocurrencies and (c) a protocol that insures & governs them.
 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiaxl7iig3h3eceftb6qulbqugv52vmwndiv6da44y7zb6lrre6ole)
The Reserve app is currently available in Latin American countries where hyperinflation has had the most significant impact: Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia & Panama. It currently has >600,000 registered users and ~120,000 weekly app visitors who use the Reserve stablecoin(s) for daily purchases such as paying for groceries, paying bills, etc. This video shows how some of our customers use our stablecoin daily (https://tinyurl.com/mudrhh4d).

The Reserve Rights (RSR) token is the governance token used to insure the stable+ cryptocurrencies against collateral defaults, and while staked, is also used to govern the RTokens (collateral changes, etc).

A key point is that when RSR is staked on a particular RToken, it will typically (% determined by governance) receive a portion of the income of the entire RToken’s collateral.

(**) We define an asset as stable+ if it never depreciates, and generally appreciates over time, relative to its backing asset(s).

## Why would RSR be a good borrow asset?
We anticipate that the yield on stRSR will drive demand to borrow RSR for two primary purposes: (a) to hedge against price changes on an existing stRSR position and (b) to borrow with intent to stake for the stRSR yield.

These are both well known strategies in DeFi and TradFi, and we don’t expect that to be any different with RSR. Furthermore, we have received a significant amount of requests from our community, but have delayed on making this request until we were closer to launching our platform.

Aave would be the first and currently, only, place to borrow RSR in DeFi and as a result, we anticipate there to be demand.

By listing RSR as a borrowable asset, Aave would become the first DeFi protocol that allows borrowing RSR and could therefore benefit from the borrowing demand from the RSR community and potentially other parties.

## Brief history of the project’s components
The main relevant components of the Reserve ecosystem are the Reserve mobile app and the Reserve Protocol.

The Reserve app has been fully open access to users in the aforementioned countries since September 2021. The full version of the Reserve protocol will be live sometime in 2022. We anticipate this happening in the early Fall, although as with all development work, this could be a bit sooner or later.

An initial concept of fully collateralized stablecoins was launched in 2019, and since then the team has been working on the fully decentralized and permissionless platform that will allow for the creation of fully collateralized, yield bearing, and insured stablecoins. Full details on this updated version can be found here: [Protocol description - Reserve](https://reserve.org/protocol/2021_version/).

## How is the asset currently used?
At this point in time the Reserve Rights (RSR) token serves as a placeholder token. From this year onward, the token will be used for two main purposes:
1. RSR holders can stake their RSR on any Reserve stablecoin (RToken) to insure it against default of one of the collateral tokens and in return, may receive a portion of the yield generated by the collateral backing RTokens.
2. RSR holders can govern Reserve stablecoin to help decide on its future (e.g. collateral assets, back-up assets, locking periods, etc).
## Emission schedule
The total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens, out of which there are currently 18.3b in circulation. The remaining 81.7b RSR tokens are locked. Out of these, 49.4b tokens belong to the Slow Wallet, 15.5b to seed investors and strategic partners and 16.8b to team members and advisors.

The [Slow Wallet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70?a=0x6bab6EB87Aa5a1e4A8310C73bDAAA8A5dAAd81C1) is a locked wallet controlled by the Reserve project, used to fund RToken adoption initiatives like listings, partnerships, marketing, etc. It’s under the discretionary control of the Reserve team. However, it has a hard-coded 4-week delay after initiating each withdrawal transaction on the blockchain. Upon initiating a withdrawal transaction, the team announces the purpose of the withdrawal either through a public on-chain message or on social media. If RSR holders do not agree with the purpose of the withdrawal, they are able to sell their RSR in the 4-week period before the project is able to sell what they have withdrawn. The team can only access these withdrawn tokens after those 4 weeks.

More details here: [Release schedule](https://reserve.org/protocol/rsr_release_schedule/#main-content)

## Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?
The total supply of RSR cannot be changed. RSR did migrate from a V1 contract in the past, and some RSR has not completed the migration yet. The only minting that occurs is from migration (which does not impact total supply).

The contract is un-upgradeable, however it is pausable. The pauser is set to the [Reserve team multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xA7b123D54BcEc14b4206dAb796982a6d5aaA6770/home), a 3-of-5 safe. Pausing will only be done in situations where the token or platform is in danger. Once the platform has reached steady state, the team intends to release pausing to a burn address.

title: [BIP-XXX] Migrate BAL to Aave Ethereum v3
status: Proposed
author: @Llama - TokenLogic & @solarcurve 
created: 2023-03-22

---

# Summary

The proposal presents the Balancer community the opportunity to migrate BAL depostied in Aave v2 to Aave v3 on Ethereum.

# Abstract

This proposal continues to builds on BIP-52 and BIP-163 by presenting the community the ability to migrate the Aave v2 BAL deposit to v3 on Ethereum.

[BIP-52](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-52-allocate-bal-liquidity-to-aave/3566) was the first proposal to suggest depositing BAL into Aave deployments to earn yield. [BIP-164](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-164-deposit-bal-into-aave-polygon-v3/4295) was approved by the community and an additional 44.5k units of BAL was deposited into Aave v3 on Polygon. This proposal is focuses on migrating the exisitng 102.75K units of BAL on Aave v2 to v3 on Ethereum, plus an initial 47.27k unit of BAL brining the total deposited amount up to 150k units. 

An AIP will be submitted this week to list BAL on Ethereum v3 with a Supply Cap of [700k units](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-bal-ethereum-v3/11523). By migrating, Balancer DAO would make up near on 1/7th of the Supply Cap and this would be extended to 21.4% upon depositing the full 150k units of BAL. 

# Motivation


After reading the Karpatkey proposal and learning that BAL falls outside of the defined remit, we would like to suggest that BAL be deposited into Aave v3 markets to earn yield. 

There is currently 102.75K units of BAL, valued at $668.14K, deposited in Aave v2. This Aave reserve is frozen, meaning users can not borrow any more BAL and they can only repay existing BAL debt.

The graphic below best respents our expectations of what Balancer DAO will receive by having funds deposited into an active Aave reserve. The below shows historical yield on Aave v3 on Polygon.

# Specification

Upon @Llama deploying the BAL liquidity pool on Aave v3 Ethereum, Balancer DAO is to migrate the full BAL holding on Aave v2 to v3 using the migration tool developed by Bored Ghost Developing.

Address: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` 

Deposit additional BAL into the Aave v3 BAL Reserve such that a total of 150k units is deposited into Aave v3 BAL Reserve. BAL is to be sourced from address shown above. 

Aave v3 BAL Reserve: `0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2`

The DAO Multisig at `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `withdraw` on 
`0x7d2768dE32b0b80b7a3454c06BdAc94A69DDc7A9` with arguments:

asset: `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` BAL token contract
amount: `102947018282743658528243` current amount of BAL our aave v2 position has
to: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` DAO Multisig

This will withdraw ~103k BAL back to the DAO Multisig from Aave v2.

Then to deposit 150k BAL to Aave v3, the DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `approve` on `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` with the following arguments:

spender: `0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2`
amount: `150000000000000000000000`

This will approve aave v3 to spend 150k BAL from the DAO Multisig.

The DAO Multisig will then call `deposit` on `0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2` with arguments:

asset: `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` BAL token contract
amount: `150000000000000000000000`
onBehalfOf: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` DAO Multisig
referralCode: `0` doesn't matter

This will deposit 150k BAL into Aave v3.

186,"As we continue to optimize CAKE rewards across all of our deployments, we are able to gradually lower the overall CAKE emission, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate a smooth trading experience. Ultimately, this enables us to contribute a greater amount of CAKE towards the weekly burn. 

Given PancakeSwap’s positive market growth across our v3 deployments as well to keep our Farms’ APR competitive against other liquidity venues, this proposal aims to decrease CAKE emission to Farms across all chains.

The previous round of [**Adjustments to Farm Rewards**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0xc3c48f2e4de3916bb5ad4d54681658b4a3940525dd1bf23eadc82aa3f3fa8ae0) increased the overall CAKE burn by approximately **1,150 CAKE per day** with minimal impact to trading volumes. This proposal aims to decrease emissions and increase the overall CAKE burn by approximately **4,000 CAKE per day**.

As time passes, this optimization will help to 1) improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across Farms and 2) continue to make CAKE deflationary.

#### Adjustment Details

With the above in mind, we are proposing to apply the following adjustments:
1. Reduce Farm emissions by 12.5% across all 8 chains (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Aptos, zkSync, Base, Arbitrum, Linea, and Polygon zkEVM)
2. BNB Chain’s core Farms will have their CAKE emissions reduced by 17.5% instead (including: BNB-USDT, BNB-BUSD, BUSD-USDT, USDC-USDT, USDC-BUSD, CAKE-BNB, CAKE-USDT, BTC-BUSD, BTC-USDT, ETH-USDT, BTC-BNB, ETH-BNB, and BTC-ETH)
3. Direct all the reduced CAKE emissions to increase our weekly burn

The purpose of this adjustment is to further turn CAKE deflationary while keeping our Farms’ APR more or less unchanged.",bullish
187,"So many Proposals take up unneeded space in the voting area, that distracts from proposals that may hold some value.

I proposal it cost a small amount of cake that is then burned to create a proposal.  I think by doing this only people who are serious with proposals will do this.  And if you proposal or part of your proposal is adopted you get your cake back.  Other wise cake is burned to make a proposal.  This would also stop duplicate proposals that essentially say the same thing, because it will be time stamped the first proposal.

Cost to make a proposl a could be equal to 1 cake.

Title: [ARFC] Onboard USDC.e to Aave V3 Gnosis Chain 
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-11

---

# **Summary**
This proposal aims to onboard USDC.e into the Aave V3 pools on Gnosis.

## Motivation

Gnosis will be deploying a new version of USDC, following the Bridge Token Standard. The migration from the older version of USDC allows for more flexibility and paves the way for deeper integration with Circle and native USDC implementations.

This proposal aims to onboard USDC.e into the Aave V3 pools on Gnosis in support of this migration, allowing Aave users to transition to the new version of USDC.

## Specification

Token Symbol: USDC.e

Address:

Chainlink oracle:

Minter Allowance Transmuter:

https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x2a22f9c3b484c3629090feed35f17ff8f88f76f0#readProxyContract#F15

**Details**
* Remove the **aura-balance-of-vlaura-vebal** strategy from Balancer Snapshot voting.

* Extend all Balancer Snapshot votes by an additional 24 hours (96 hours total) to provide additional time to run a meta-snapshot.  This also ensures that Balancer governance ends during the week in all timezones.  Future votes will therefore start on Thursdays and end on Mondays.

191,"The Foundation Board would like to propose Danko be appointed as director of the Balancer Foundation, representing the community, effective 1 December 2022. According to article 5.3 of Balancer’s Foundation Articles of Association: “The Token Holders have the power, by Governance Resolution, to appoint or remove Directors.”

As previously mentioned on community updates, Mkflow is stepping down as director of the Balancer Foundation to take up other roles in the community. Firstly, the Foundation directors and management would like to thank Mkflow for his services, which have been a great addition in the early stages of establishing operations. The Board also notes they have accepted Mkflow’s resignation effective 1 December 2022.

The Foundation board has screened candidates for the role and has identified Danko as the best fit for the current needs of the Foundation.

Danko is well known in the Balancer community, and I’ll include some background here for those less acquainted. Danko has been a Balancer DAO community member since Q2 of 2022, when he first joined the Operations and Partnerships subDAO as a Baller. As the DAO's framework began to shift in Q3, Danko joined the Balancer Maxis workgroup, being responsible for onboarding new DAO members and helping contributors and third-party projects navigate the protocol. During this time, Danko has proven himself a reliable and trustworthy member of the Balancer community, representing Balancer in several key meetings, events, and conversations.

Danko is a Founding Member of BanklessBR DAO, a Brazilian community that helps people enter the web3 space, where he was a core-team contributor until last July, publishing and translating several articles, specially on the topic of DAO communities. He was also an active member of numerous NFT communities and supported local artists with web3 education.

IRL, Danko has more than 13 years’ experience in law enforcement as a forensic scientist and investigator. His formal academic background includes a Bachelor’s degree in law and a Masters degree in Public Policies. This drives Danko’s interest in the DeFi space in general, and the future of our industry.

As there will be no overlap of directors, there will be no additional cost to the Balancer DAO and no funds are requested under this proposal.

196,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-polygon-authorize-batch-relayer-v2-for-usd-boosted-pool/2655).

This proposal aims to authorize an updated version of the Batch Relayer which adds (un)wrapping capabilities for [ERC-4626 tokens](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) and [UnbuttonTokens](https://github.com/buttonwood-protocol/button-wrappers/blob/main/contracts/UnbuttonToken.sol#L18). For reference, the [original Batch Relayer](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0xedff802a4ffb1ba0e131c7d4126fa669648a9333860a74de57c9e5971b9ec541) enabled atomic sequences of `swaps`, `joins`, and `exits`, as well as (un)wrapping of stETH and Aave aTokens. Batch Relayer V2 retains all of those features from V1.

This proposal seeks authorization for Batch Relayer V2 **only on Polygon**, as it is anticipated that a Batch Relayer V3 will soon be available on all networks. This intermediate release is targeted specifically at a new USD+ Boosted Pool on Polygon.

The relayer would be granted authority to perform the following tasks on behalf of users **who have opted into using it**:

* Leverage the user’s existing Vault allowances and internal balances to avoid duplicate approvals.
* Swap on the user’s behalf.
* Add and remove liquidity on the user’s behalf.

## Motivation

The team at [Overnight](https://overnight.fi/), who created the USD+ yield-bearing stable coin, played a significant role in the development of the new [`ERC4626LinearPool`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/pool-linear/contracts/erc4626/ERC4626LinearPool.sol). This pool supports tokens implementing the recently finalized [EIP-4626 Tokenized Vault Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626), and the Balancer Integrations Team believes it has the potential to open up Boosted Pools to a plethora of yield-bearing tokens. We thank Overnight for their patience throughout the integrations process and would like to add relayer support for their new pool as soon as possible.

The relayer will enable trades involving the rebasing USD+ which is incompatible with the Balancer Vault. It does this by (un)wrapping from/to the StaticUsdPlus token, which is an ERC-4626 token wrapper that removes the rebasing component. This will effectively create direct markets for USD+ on Balancer, not only via DAI, USDC, and USDT, but also via multihop to any other connected token within the Vault. For example, the relayer would enable the following atomic DAI->USD+ trade:

1. perform a multihop batch swap from DAI to StaticUsdPlus through the USD+ Boosted Pool;
2. unwrap the StaticUsdPlus tokens from step 1, receiving plain USD+ tokens;

## Risks

This proposal would only grant the required roles to the `BalancerRelayer` contract. Each user would still be required to opt into the relayer by submitting an approval transaction or signing a message.

The code is a simple wrapper over existing Balancer pool interactions, and it has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the Balancer Labs team.

The addresses of the `BalancerRelayer` and `BatchRelayerLibrary` mentioned in this proposal can be found in the [official repo](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/pull/1182/commits/cc113a4aaa9f3869a5accfdf236eafd6528a74d2).

## Specification

The Balancer governance multisig **on Polygon** would submit a transaction to the `Authorizer` in order to grant the following roles to the `BalancerRelayer`:

1. `manageUserBalance` : Utilize existing Vault allowances and internal balances so that a user does not have to re-approve the new relayer for each token.
2. `joinPool` : Add liquidity to a pool on the user’s behalf.
3. `exitPool` : Remove liquidity from a pool on the user’s behalf.
4. `swap` : Trade within a single pool on the user’s behalf.
5. `batchSwap` : Make a multihop trade or source liquidity from multiple pools.
6. `setRelayerApproval` : Approve the relayer on the user’s behalf (user must still provide a signed message).

The Gnosis Safe at `0xd2bD536ADB0198f74D5f4f2Bd4Fe68Bae1e1Ba80` would send a transaction to the Vault Authorizer at `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` with the following data to authorize the BalancerRelayer at `0xF537dDd7f4cc72C6C08866b62EAe9378f1F62da8`:

198,"# PancakeSwap Welcomes TitanSwap to Syrup Pool!


CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from TitanSwap, a decentralised exchange (DEX) that offers cross-chain swaps between Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.


# The Syrup Pool:
Stake CAKE tokens to earn TITAN  tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 154,000 TITAN
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start block:** 9001200 (approx. 9am UTC on July 9th)
- **Finish block:** 10729200 (approx. 9am UTC on September 7th)
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.08912 TITAN


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.


# The Farm:
In order to host the TITAN Syrup Pool, we will need to provide a TITAN-BUSD farm that will have 2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours and then 1x CAKE rewards after that. 


# What is TitanSwap?

TitanSwap is a decentralised exchange (DEX) that offers cross-chain swaps between Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. It is designed to be a competitor to Uniswap, by offering higher rates to liquidity providers paid out in its native token TITAN. 

TitanSwap offers its own liquidity pools, but also provides traders access to other DEX liquidity pools such as SushiSwap and MDEX, which makes it similar to 1inch. The TITAN token is used for governance and a range of features, and is paid out to liquidity providers with 90% of the total 1 billion coins reserved for this purpose.

As of July 6th, TitanSwap went live on Binance Smart Chain! 

### To learn more about TitanSwap, the chefs advise you to visit their official communication channels:

- Visit this webpage: [**https://pancakeswap.finance/syrup** ](https://pancakeswap.finance/syrup )
- Click “Approve CAKE” on the TITAN Syrup Pool 
- Click on the stake button.
- Confirm the transaction.

BEP20 TITAN will also be circulating and transferable on BSC when we start the Syrup pool, so you will be able to harvest your TITAN tokens and trade on PancakeSwap at any time!

Any other TITAN token will be a scam and will result in a financial loss for users. Do not buy tokens from any other token address. Always verify the token address before purchasing tokens. If you receive airdrops from another address for TITAN tokens, they will be rotten tokens (but not the cool kind!), and we advise you to ignore them.",neutral

 The Balancer Maxis are a passionate group of Balancer community contributors. A center of excellence that keeps the Balancer ecosystem operating at a first class level. As the protocol grows, this team's responsibilities will likely grow with it. We have picked up maintenance tasks from other organizations in the Balancer ecosystem as it continues to decentralize and would expect this to continue (see examples below).

### Leader(s)

Solarcurve - joined by Zekraken, Mike B, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, and Danko8383.

**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct (or link to your own)**: Yes

**Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines:** Yes

### Domains of Operation

*Multisig Management*

* Linear (boosted) pool settings
* Swap fee and amplification adjustments
* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL
* Adding new reward tokens to gauges
* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees
* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig

**Expertise:** Besides setting swap fees, this group has done all these tasks from day 1. Soon after we took control of swap fees from our friends at Gauntlet, the protocol broke the previous record of 24h fees earned. We believe our track record justifies our continued management of these multisigs until such time as governance approves another SP to take them over.

*Governance*

* We serve on the [Governance Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp/2324) and ensure continuity of Balancer’s Governance Process
* Active participants in discord and the forum on governance topics
* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)
* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process
* Manage admin of the Governance forum
* We will pursue various strategic initiatives, either individually or as a group, at our discretion such as deploying to Optimism or the new Operating Framework
* In the cases that voting power in other protocols from tokens held in Balancer’s Treasury has been delegated to us, we will represent Balancer’s interest in these votes.

**Expertise:** We helped to design Balancer’s governance system and are very active users of it. It is safe to say our group has the strongest working knowledge of Balancer’s governance system outside of Balancer Labs. For now it does require active management to ensure votes are carried out in an orderly fashion then properly executed. We believe our track record here again speaks for itself and we will continue to operate in the same fashion we have been until governance approves a new governance framework or approves another SP to take these tasks over.

*User/project support*

* We manage Balancer’s discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed
* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions
* We often deploy new pools for other projects
* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists
* We help with UI testing for Balancer

**Expertise:** If you come to discord we’ll likely be the ones helping you out. We are also spread out in many chats with projects offering advice and performing routine necessary tasks as described above. It is safe to say almost all projects that have used Balancer over the last year have spoken to one of us at some point. We will continue to operate in this support capacity and offer any assistance we can to the community and the efforts of other SP’s.

*Community*

* We manage a Coordinape circle open to all DAO contributors
* Onboarding framework for new contributors
* Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO, or between SPs
* Regular health-check on SP and community contributors with recurrent feedback

**Expertise:** These initiatives were pioneered by some of our members over the last six months. We will continue iterating and exploring these both with our in house knowledge but also in collaboration with the broader community.

*Record Keeping*

* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.
* Maintaining, updating, and improving official Balancer documentation as a bridge between the greater community and core development team.

### Key Objectives & Success Metrics

*Multisig Management*

* Transactions are vetted for accuracy and executed in a timely manner
* Public discord channels are used for swap fee discussion so the community can provide input and feedback.

*Governance*

* Balancer’s Governance system continues to operate in a fair and transparent manner.
* We will continue being very active participants and leaders

*User/project support*

* Discord/telegram chat questions will be answered in a timely manner

*Community*

* Coordinape will pay out promptly each month
* We will act as a touch point for any interested contributors to Balancer DAO

*Global*

* We commit to undertake all activities in public where reasonable. We aim to responsibly grow the Balancer Maxis and this can only be done when the community is able to interact and engage with us. There must be more opportunities for this in the future.
* We will continue to facilitate the weekly Treasury meeting (Tuesday 11am EST in discord) open to the public. This is a good opportunity for anyone in the community to talk to us about the Treasury or any other relevant topic.
* We will facilitate a monthly community call where all SP’s are welcome to join for their monthly updates. This eases the burden on the community to attend many calls. Again, optional participation by other SP’s.

### Length of Engagement & Budget:

3 months.

Budget of 6,875 BAL per month for salaries (1,250 per person, Danko at 625) which will be max locked in veBAL by contributors. Additional monthly allocations of 100 BAL for gas costs and 4,000 BAL for Coordinape.

**Total for 3 month engagement:** 32,925 BAL

**Impact on the Treasury**: The Treasury currently holds ~4M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis would cost less than 1% of the treasury’s BAL holdings.

**ETH Address to Receive Funds**: 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325

**Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation):** N/A

*As a final note, if this proposal passes Zen Dragon will be replacing mkflow on the Governance Council as he voluntarily steps away and into other roles in the ecosystem. We thank him for his service. The members of the council will now be Solarcurve, Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, and Zen Dragon.*",bullish

The Balancer gauge space has become quite cluttered.  This BIP proposes to remove a number of gauges that have been around for a while but are not receiving any votes.   The purpose of this governance is not to remove a gauge that is in use by a DAO, but simply to clean up gauges that seem to be abandoned.  Any DAO managing one of the tokens in the gauges listed below is welcome to request it is removed from the list of gauges to be removed so long as there is a clear plan to either obtain vote weight to trigger emissions from it or promote significant volume in the near future. 

### Specification

This BIP recommends the the removal of gauges for the following pools, all of which have received 0 or very minimal voting in recent rounds, and also are not generating significant activity in the form of trading volume or fees. Note the accompanying gauge address for each pool.

205,"Title: [ARFC] Add sFRAX on Ethereum V3

Author: @0xlide, @SaucyBlock and ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

Date: 2024-01-18

# Summary
This publication presents the community an opportunity to add sFRAX to the Ethereum Aave V3 Liquidity Pool.

# Motivation
Staked FRAX (sFRAX) is an ERC-4626 staking vault that distributes a portion of the Frax Protocol yield. sFRAX APY attempts to roughly track the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate of the United States Federal Reserve.

Integrating sFRAX as collateral asset in the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool has the potential to create new demand for borrowable assets on Aave V3, such as stablecoins and FXS.

206,"### Background:

Uniswap’s [genesis liquidity incentive program](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) ends on Nov 17. The existing program distributed 20 million UNI to LPs over 2 months, split evenly between the WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, and DAI/ETH pools. This works out to 2.5 million UNI per pool, per month.

#### Benefits of UNI distribution to LPs:

* Ongoing incentives allows UNI to be distributed to those providing value in the form of liquidity
* The incentivized pools are likely to remain the most liquid DEX pair on Ethereum, providing a venue to trade against ETH at virtually any size with zero slippage.
* Reduced incentives prevents UNI from being distributed ‘too fast’, marked by all tokens being distributed before the Foundation’s four year vesting has passed.

#### Drawbacks of UNI distribution to LPs:

* Ongoing incentives result in UNI largely being ‘farmed and dumped’ to earn yield. See ETH USD Yield Farm, Pickle, Harvest and Alpha.
* Reduced incentives means UNI is distributed slower.
* Incentivizing the same pools can be seen as choosing ‘winners’ by selecting WBTC as THE Bitcoin on Ethereum and favoring certain stablecoins over others.

### Proposed new distribution:

Distribute UNI for an additional 2 months from the time this proposal is adopted and executed by governance. Distribute to the same 4 pools, but at half the rate of the genesis distribution. This works out to 1.25 million UNI per month to each of the 4 covered pools (WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, DAI/ETH), for a total of 5M UNI per month, or 10M UNI total over the next 2 months.

Please see the liquidity incentive [governance plan document](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590) for full details and timelines.

### Temperature check question:

Should Uniswap distribute UNI to liquidity providers per the specifications outlined above?

### Next steps:

The snapshot poll will be live for 3 days. If the poll passes with a minimum of 25,000 UNI in support, this proposal will move forward to the consensus check phase.

# TLDR:

Proposal to have 45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity between BAL and uncapped tokens (WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC). Wallets flagged as Balancer Labs shareholders don't qualify for this ""liquidity staking"" extra incentive.
The main goals are to significantly increase liquidity on key BAL pairs and to allow non-shareholders to compound their BAL holdings at a much faster pace, accelerating protocol decentralization.

![image|621x500, 50%](upload://5S3GvpjON1hNGnO7wuSfqNd3smk.png)   


# Motivation

The **importance of BAL liquidity** can't be overstated:

* *TRUER PRICE DISCOVERY*: it improves trading conditions for all market participants (lower spreads and less slippage for both buyers and sellers), allowing for a more transparent and effective price discovery process;

* *SUPERIOR LP INCENTIVES*: a stronger token (with higher price inertia) results in a higher quality for the incentives given to LPs (liquidity providers) via liquidity mining;

* *SHARPER GOVERNANCE*: it opens doors to a new class of invaluable stakeholders and protocol governors (e.g. larger investors, especially those heavily involved in and experienced with DeFi protocols);

* *BROADER GOVERNANCE*: with no participation from Balancer Labs' shareholders (more on that later), liquidity staking will accelerate BAL distribution and protocol decentralization by giving all other BAL holders the opportunity to compound their governance rights at a much faster pace;

* *SAFER GOVERNANCE*: pools are non-custodial and BAL in them retain full voting power (i.e. no need to withdraw liquidity to vote), such that high liquidity and a healthy governance are not in conflict;

Balancer itself being a DEX, it feels only natural as the ideal venue for high BAL liquidity to be incentivized. Finally, it's worth noting that allowing a high portion of the token supply to be concentrated on *centralized* exchanges could expose the governance to significant risks, as illustrated by the episode with STEEM.


# Recapping: how liquidity adjustment currently works

The 145k BAL [weekly distribution](https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/bal-liquidity-mining) to LPs on Balancer is calculated proportionally to the *adjusted* liquidity contributed by each LP. This adjustment is made by applying (i.e. multiplying) a few *factors* to their liquidity measured in dollar terms.

Naturally, the value of those factors can be:
* equal to `1`, having no effect;
* less than `1`, acting as a penalty (when the liquidity is deemed less useful);
* greater than `1`, acting as an extra incentive.

A `feeFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-feefactor-toward-reducing-the-mining-penalty-for-high-fee-pools/103)) applies a small penalty to pools with higher fees.

**For each pair inside a pool**, we apply:
*  a `wrapFactor` of:
   * `1.0` for uncorrelated pairs (no penalty),
   * `0.2` for [soft pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-wrapfactor-applying-a-0-2-factor-to-soft-pegged-pairs/138),
   * `0.1` for [hard pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/wrapfactor-penalizing-pairs-of-equivalent-tokens-in-liquidity-mining/28); and 

* a `BRF` (BAL & Ratio Factor), which is the combination of a `ratioFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/introduction-of-a-weight-ratio-factor-in-liquidity-mining/15)) and a `stakingBoost ≥ 1` (described in [this proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102) and with further calculation details specified in its [ammendment](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102/4)). 
`BRF = stakingBoost * ratioFactor`
  * If the pair is **not** of type `{BAL & uncapped_token}` (uncapped tokens currently being: WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC, BAL), then its `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. the incentive doesn't apply to this pair).

The current `BRF` will only depend on the characteristics of the pool (its tokens and weights), and may have a maximum value of `1.54`. It looks like this:

![image|690x455, 75%](upload://xqztRzplangZYzS0j70jlwfgc7P.png) 

After looping through all possible pairs in a pool, we combine their factors (via [weighted average](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/master/lib/factors.js#L111)) and the result is a `wrapFactor` and a `BRF` for the whole pool. 

Finally, we calculate and apply a `tokenCapFactor` adjusting down the liquidity of a token when it exceeds a predetermined maximum. Except for the 5 uncapped tokens already mentioned, all tokens eligible for liquidity mining are currently capped at $10M each. See more details on [how to calculate it](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56) and the [recent changes](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217) to how token caps will evolve.

# The Proposal

This is a proposal to have **45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity staking**.

This extra incentive is:

> all BAL distributed as a result of applying a `stakingBoost > 1` to the liquidity of `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs, from wallets which are not flagged as shareholders of Balancer Labs.

The remaining **100k BAL would be distributed to all LPs** in all eligible pools, disconsidering the effect of a `stakingBoost` (i.e. all liquidity being subject to `BRF = ratioFactor`).

The constant value now would be: `STAKERS_SHARE = 45000 / 145000`, and we can then calculate the unique value for `stakingBoost` that satisfies this target distribution. 

The intended result is for BAL liquidity on Balancer to increase substantially, **but in a self-regulated way**. 

The simple yet powerful idea is: as BAL liquidity gets higher the extra incentive to staking gets **diluted among stakers**, so that our constant target for `STAKERS_SHARE` is met.

In a more visual approach:
 
* when non-shareholder BAL liquidity is low, the `stakingBoost` will be high, resulting in a high `BRF` (a hypothetical scenario being the **orange** curve in the graph below, in which `BRF` peaks at `12`), so there will be a *very strong* incentive for BAL liquidity to increase;

* when non-shareholer BAL liquidity is high (the desired scenario), the `stakingBoost` will have come down to lower levels, resulting in a lower BRF (a hypothetical scenario being the **green** curve below, in which `BRF` peaks at `3`).

![image|621x500](upload://oI5XnPgsZE1VcQWDyeJCWovr1IV.png)  

# Calculating the stakingBoost: a practical example

We first calculate the `liquidityPreStaking`: the total adjusted liquidity from applying all factors, but with `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. `BRF = ratioFactor`). Let's say the result was $200M.

We will need to apply a yet unknown stakingBoost so that:
```STAKERS_SHARE = (finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / finalLiquidity```

... which can also be stated as:
```finalLiquidity = liquidityPreStaking / (1 - STAKERS_SHARE)```

In our example:
```finalLiquidity = $200M / (1 - 45000/145000) = $290M```

We may apply any temporary `tempStakingBoost > 1` to `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs from non-shareholder LPs, resulting in a `tempLiquidity`. Let's say our result was $230M. This would mean the `tempStakingBoost` increased the adjusted liquidity in $30M, while what we actually want is an increase of $90M.

Now to get the desired `stakingBoost`, we only need to ""stretch"" or ""shrink"" the `tempStakingBoost` according to the ratio between the two liquidity adjustments (desired & temporary):

```
(finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / (tempLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
```
... which in our example would result in:
```
(290 - 200) / (230 - 200) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
stakingBoost = 3 * tempStakingBoost
```

# Shareholder Addresses

An important aspect of this proposal is that Balancer Labs shareholders (investors, advisors and founders) seem aligned with the spirit of the proposal: to accelerate governance rights distribution. In order to achieve this goal, their wallets will be excluded from participating in liquidity staking. This restriction doesn't apply to eventual BAL they hold that are unrelated to their shareholder allocations, for instance BAL bought on the market or earned through being LPs with tokens other than their BAL shareholder allocation.

[Here is the complete list of shareholder addresses to be excluded from liquidity staking](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/liquidity-staking/src/users.ts).

Note: wallets currently tagged as ""Balancer: Shareholder XX"" on Etherscan are actually *vesting smart contracts* which hold mostly locked (i.e. yet unvested) BAL. Vesting happens continuously and linearly over a period of 3 years which started at token launch (2020-06-20). When finally vested (i.e. free to transfer), BAL can only be withdrawn to the respective beneficiary address of each vesting contract. The addresses listed above are the 51 unique beneficiaries of the 51 vesting contracts. All the BAL balance they already hold is vested.

The community is willing to tolerate up to about 10k BAL per week per shareholder being sent to centralized exchanges as they are cognizant of shareholders also seeking to deleverage their BAL positions over time, without attempting to subvert the exclusion list. In case some large BAL balances move to third-party custody solutions held in segregated addresses or to multisig wallets (both situations are likely to happen), the current list may be updated to reflect those new shareholder addresses as also excluded from liquidity staking.

The community will have the prerogative to update this list so that changes are effective already before any still pending weekly distribution.",bullish

**TL:DR**

As outlined in the [new whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the MKR capFactor from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). MKR has exceeded $10m adjusted liquidity for a period of time. MKR bring good liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem.

---

**The Proposal**

This is a proposal to increase the MKR cap Tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). MKR currently has $16M in adjusted liquidity and has probably surpassed it's $10M cap for a month.

MKR brings useful liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem. Before, Uniswap used to be the most popular DEX for trading MKR.

---

**What is MKR?**

MKR is a DeFi large cap, it currently has a $600M market cap. There's currently $1.5B locked in MakerDAO, and 425M DAI has been minted.

SCD (Single Collateral DAI) was launched in December 2017. MCD (Multi Collateral DAI) was launched in November 2019.

MakerDAO is a decentralized credit platform on Ethereum that supports DAI, a stablecoin whose value is pegged to USD. Anyone can use Maker to open a Vault, lock in collateral such as ETH, BAT, or WBTC ... and generate Dai as debt against that collateral. Dai debt incurs a stability fee (i.e., continuously accruing interest), which is paid upon repayment of borrowed Dai. DAI is collected as system surplus, and then used in FLAP auctions to burn MKR.

MKR can also be used as a governance token to govern the system. MKR holders also act as the last line of defense in case of a black swan event. If system-wide collateral value falls too low too fast, MKR is minted and sold on the open market to raise more collateral, diluting MKR holders.

212,"Summary:

dForce proposes to add a dToken pool (dUSDx/dDAI/dUSDC/dUSDT). dToken is a yield aggregator launched by dForce, featured by harvesting the highest underlying yield in the market (USDT 12.1% APY, USDC 6.1% APY, DAI 12.1% APY, as of 31 Aug), as well as gas optimization through a set of strategies that is anticipated to save at least 60% of gas consumption associated (compared to direct interactions with underlying lending protocol for asset supply and sale of governance token mined).
Currently, dToken pool participants can farm DF token by staking through dForce Staking Portal (https://staking.dforce.network/) (mining APY 109% for USDx/USDC on Uniswap), by adding a dToken pool on Curve, LPs could provide liquidity and have the benefit of mining both DF and CRV, (i.e with projected combined yield of 170%), which is a great additional yield incentive to LPs on Curve.

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V3 Ethereum. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-aave-v3-eth-pool-weth-parameters/15110).


## Motivation

The current yields of stETH and reth have been observed at 3.3% and 3.07% respectively. By adjusting the slope1 parameter of WETH, we aim to:

- Enhance Profitability in Leverage Loops: The proposed adjustment will make leverage loops more profitable for users.
- Align with stETH and reth Yields: The adjustment aims to set the slope1 slightly below the current yields of stETH and reth, ensuring Aave remains competitive.

Increased utilization of ETH reserve is expected to partly compensate for the slight loss of protocol revenue due to lower interest rate equilibrium.





## Specification

We propose two options for the weth slope1 parameters:

- **Option 1 (Conservative)**: Set slope1 to 3.2%. 10 bps below stETH yield but above rETH yield
- **Option 2 (Aggressive)**: Set slope1 to 2.8%. 50 below stETH yield & 23bps below rETH yield allowing both to be profitable.

Additionally, we propose reducing the optimalRatio to 80% to mitigate liquidity risks.

**Summary:**
Whitelist the gauge for the pool [50% FOLD / 50% WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xa9f3692ab025400ddcf212542302190cad83b6300002000000000000000002c8)

**Protocol Description:**

Manifold Finance enables and provides access to high-value transaction pools on EVM compatible chains, through our infrastructure: *SecureRPC* . They aggregate multiple endpoints along with maintaining direct access to disparate mining pools/validator nodes (Flashbots, Eden, Miners).

**Motivation:**

Current onchain liquidity is sitting at only 300k while generating in the past few days over 4m$ in volume incentives & bribes to deepen liquidity at this stage of growth is key for Manifold.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** 

Governance utilizes an architecture of elected dictator. By staking FOLD tokens, you delegate protocol control to one address (the dictator). The dictator offers a tribute (rewards) for your support. Accounts that are participating in the dictator regime may elect to vote for a new supreme dictator (operator/management for the protocol) by removing their support and reallocating it towards a new address.  
Source : https://github.com/manifoldfinance/majordomo

A known attack vector involving sandwich staking is mitigated by manually disbursing tributes. This attack vector will be mitigated by a time-dependent withdrawal period in our V2 Vault upgrade. 

> Note that this attack vector has never been actually realized, as it was caught beforehand

Protocol Fees are immediately collected in a vault which then distributes it over time (the time withdrawal is to prevent MEV attacks against the protocol in which accounts enter/exit during certain periods of time). 

A Multisig address is available. The multisig only holds tokens for the purposes of voting in governance proposals of other DAO's. This will be migrated to a vault-based permissive action list structure in which the tokens are held in-vault, with certain permissions enabled for the operator address only. 

2. **Oracles:** 

Not Applicable. 

3. **Audits:**  

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/pki#security-bug-handling-process

https://www.manifoldfinance.com/.well-known/security.txt

Additionally they maintain the DeFi Threat Matrix which is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations on decentralized finance

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/defi-threat/security/advisories?state=published



4. **Centralization vectors:** 

They utilize a concept of Permissive Action List to enable a two-step ownership process for any partner integrations. 

Centralization risks include but are not limited to:

GitHub - we perform off site backups and coordination in the event of GitHub deleting the manifoldfinance org (see LMDBX event for an example).

Google Services: We utilize a domain name not administered by Google for internal services such as user registration, etc. This is not the manifoldfinance.com email address.

Governance Discussions occur on a centralized service, Discourse. [see forums.manifoldfinance.com](https://forums.manifoldfinance.com)

There are also certain account addresses with a large amount of FOLD tokens. However we feel that due to the 'unique' governance regime that this is not in practice a risk factor as it would normally be under traditional DAO governance structures. 

5. **Market History:** 

Pool has been activated in the past 14 days and saw over 225k volume since inception on approximately 84k$ BPT with a current APR of 256% & fees of 1200$ in the past 24h.

217,"Few days ago i've got a lottie NFT reward, for buying lottery ticket some time ago. And it gave an idea. 

To get the NFT i had to buy something, which is not ideal for people that can't afford wasting money for tickets. Its kinda Pay2Win right now. 


My idea is about making NFTs rewards open for everyone and giving out to all people for random actions such as:


+ NFT reward for people that held their cake for 15days, 30days, 60days, +++ on staking. 
+ NFT reward for people that clicked on Pools button the most.
+ NFT reward for people that made the most trades on pancakeswap.
+ NFT reward for people that voted the most times.
+ NFT reward for people that downvoted the most times.
+ NFT reward for people that made the most proposals.
+ NFT reward for people that made the most right predictions.
+ NFT reward for people that made the most wrong predictions.
+ NFT reward for people that staked in the biggest numer of pools.
+ NFT reward for people that visit PCS the most.
+ NFT reward for people that already been holding their NFTs for a long time.
+ NFT reward for people that been using PCS since specific time.
+ NFT reward for people that bought CAKE at specific price, ex. $10.00
+ NFT reward for people that been making such good ideas like this one :D jkjk


I know, there will be bots, random proposals, downvoting for no reason, spammers. I know!

Thats why i think it could not be a visible ""achievement"". Just devs randomly deciding what they will give the nft for. Also i think there could be made verifications, what i mean by that, website visits only count once a 5min, and you need to spend atleast 2mins on it. Proposals can be made only when your wallet is some time old. 


Whole proposal and the ideas were made for the bigger picture, and for the whole idea of making NFTs open for people that cant afford spending alot of money.",neutral
218,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-gauntlet-and-the-ballers-multisig-to-manage-pool-parameters/2400).

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable Gauntlet and a multisig controlled by Ballers to control certain parameters of the Boosted Pools so as to increase their capital efficiency and returns to liquidity providers.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) contain a series of parameters that affect their efficiency and can be tuned depending on market conditions:

* Boosted Stable Pools ( `StablePhantomPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * amplification parameter
  * token rate cache duration
* Boosted Linear Pools ( `AaveLinearPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * lower target
  * upper target

Gauntlet has been managing fees and amplification factor in weighted and stable pools, and would be able to do so for Boosted Stable Pools if this proposal is approved by the community.

The duration of the token rate cache can have an impact on a boosted pool’s capital efficiency. If the duration is too long, the pool can be arbed for all the interest accrued on Aave since the last update of the cache. A short duration mitigates this risk, with the downside of increasing gas costs for trades.

On Linear Pools, swap fees are not collected by liquidity providers, but rather act as an incentive for arbitragers/keepers to:

1. withdraw main tokens from the pool, deposit them in Aave and deposit the aTokens in the pool when it has main tokens in excess;
2. withdraw aTokens from the pool, withdraw the underlying from Aave and deposit the main token to the pool when it has a low balance of main tokens;

The lower and upper targets determine a range within which no fee in imposed on trades between main tokens and Aave tokens. A trader moving the balance of main tokens away from this range pays a fee to the pool, which the pool then returns to traders that move the balance back towards the range.

While we’re confident that Gauntlet can hit the ground running with respect to optimizing the swap fee and amplification factor of Boosted Stable Pools, there’s still much to be learned when it comes to the other four parameters described above. For this reason, this proposal would authorize a multisig held by Ballers to set those parameters. Balancer Labs would monitor the activiy on the pools and the market conditions and advise on the the best course of action, but Ballers would be the ultimate decision makers, acting on behalf of BAL holders. All updates would be announced in Discord beforehand.

**Summary**

This proposal enables a Gyroscope gauge for a R/sDAI Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP) on Ethereum Mainnet. The pool will be seeded with liquidity in the 0.9 - 1.001 range and two other pools with liquidity in the 0.95 - 1.001 and 0.98 - 1.001 range will follow soon. By deploying these new pools, users will be able to trade between R and sDAI at extremely low price impact in the 0.9 - 1.001 R/sDAI range. The deployment of this pool builds upon the release of the Peg Stability Module (PSM), aimed at stabilizing the R peg and providing a source of yield for R Savings Module depositors through the accumulation of sDAI.

**Protocol description**

Raft is a DeFi protocol that lets you generate $R, a leading decentralized USD stablecoin, by opening a CDP (collateralized debt position), or by depositing stablecoins into the Raft protocol reserve.R is backed by high quality collateral assets such as[ stETH](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth) (Lido Staked Ether) and[ rETH](https://stake.rocketpool.net/) (Rocket Pool ETH) and reserve assets such as[ CHAI](https://chai.money/), the yield-bearing version of the DAI stablecoin. R aims to be the stablecoin of choice within the decentralized ecosystem, with deep liquidity across many trading pairs, a high yield, and a stable peg. As more use cases for $R develop, users will be able to spend, swap, and earn with $R. Users will also be able to leverage up to 6x on different LSD tokens in a single atomic transaction.

**Motivation**

The R/sDAI pool on Gyroscope is a natural progression from the PSM, offering swaps from R to sDAI with the best price impact conditions compared to other uniform liquidity pools. The pool will receive incentives that will be distributed based on the PSM's ongoing usage and the development of the R peg over time. Liquidity providers in such pool will benefit from earning the DAI Savings Rate and from being depositors in the most capital efficient pool where to trade R.

The pool will have 5 bps swap fees, an amplification coefficient of 700 and a 10 bps upper price bound that enables the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.

**Specifications**

1. Governance: The Raft governance model focuses on being efficient, transparent, and community-driven, while maintaining a governance-minimized approach. The governance model will be strengthened further by the launch of a native token that confers governance power to its holders.

2. Oracles: The pools rely on price feeds from Chainlink and Tellor

3. Audits: Raft is audited by Trail of Bits and Hats Finance

4. Market History: Raft was launched on June 5th 2023 and has attracted approx $65m TVL at its peak. The Raft team has worked with the Balancer community to launch two successful pools (see $R here, the R/DAI pool on Balancer[ here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x20a61b948e33879ce7f23e535cc7baa3bc66c5a9000000000000000000000555) and R/wstETH pool[ here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x380aabe019ed2a9c2d632b51eddd30fd804d0fad0002000000000000000005547c47f942beea)) . We would like to continue working within the Balancer ecosystem going forward.

5. Value: The R/DAI pool deployed on Balancer has been among the top 5 pools on Balancer by trading volume in the last few weeks, exceeding $ 1 mln daily trading volume. We expect the R/sDAI pool on Gyroscope to generate a consistent amount of volume due to the capital efficiency embedded in the concentrated liquidity model and in the choice of pairing R with a yield-bearing asset like sDAI

**Centralization vectors**

1. Liquidations are permissionless (anybody can liquidate)
2. The key parts of the Raft protocol are immutable
3. The Liquidity Committee includes 3 Raft team members. More to be added in the future as the Raft governance evolves

222,"A clarion call for the reduction of cake mission per block, it is now clear that even with cake burn and the buyback of cake, that cake is still highly inflational and this is negatively harming the price of cake as most whales that get a lot of cakes always crash the price once there is a little rise, even if new investors keep buying cake the high emission will keep crippling the price. 
             
						 it is quite obvious that the cake community are clamouring for further  reduction in the emission as a vote for emission reduction has never failed before, even in the various telegram groups, members are always complaining about the negative influence of high emission on price, the community clearly understands that reduction in emmision will also reduce the farm and pool rewards and i can bet that a higher percentage of the community will be in affirmation with emission reduction, even if emmision is further reduced the apy for pools will still be attractive to investors as you can count how many trusted defi protocols that can offer such huge rewards 
						 
						 It is therefore pertinent that the emission of cake per block be drastically reduced in order to battle inflation, the chefs have been working hard to device so many means to tackle inflation but even at that, millions of cakes are still added to the total supply of cake which in turn negatively affects the price.

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module (SM) protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested.

# Abstract

The Safety Module is a $700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users. It’s a unique mechanism within DeFi, that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users. At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market. As a result, not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection.

As new markets hold more risk at launch, they are initially excluded from the SM protection. Today, most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO, they seem fit for SM protection.

# Motivation

The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi. This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market. As new markets hold additional risk, these are not initially protected by the SM. However, once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months, the risks are significantly lower. Furthermore, the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process, with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2.

Overall, these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market, holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market. This implies that, in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market, the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market. Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks, as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers.

Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers (lps) on these markets. By reducing the risk for lps, it is expected to lead to further growth of the market’s TVL overtime. Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets, lps are treated more equally across the markets.

The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets. In the case of Aave markets on other chains, the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure, and not failures caused by the chains themselves (Polygon/Avax). With regards to the Aave Arc Market, Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAO’s stated risk parameters, should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update, the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance.

These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem. In particular, the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive. Today, most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon, while just about 100k on Ethereum V2. These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections, in a shorter time period.

226,"This proposal has two principles to empower Ultrasound CAKE.


1. Increase the MAX CAPS (proposed weight gauges) for the CAKE pool from 35% to 60%.


Pros - This will undoubtedly encourage more CAKE staking, consequently strengthening the entire community and reducing selling pressure.


2. Develop a new aggressive reduction plan (around 50%) of emissions to take place over the next 4 months.


Pros - It is crucial to signal greater scarcity of CAKE to the market. All holders stand to gain from this measure. And this could happen until the BTC halving to take advantage of the bull run - THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TIMING.


Cons - This two proposals may decrease CAKE reward in farms. However, perform an analysis. There are two types of suppliers:


1. The holder
2. Those who sell CAKE to increase their APR farm.


The holder will not be bothered by these measures as they will benefit from them. However, those who sell CAKE will have two alternatives. Either they will start to become holders, which is beneficial for the community, or they will lose some selling CAKE rewards. But okay, they can continue selling, as the selling pressure will decrease significantly, and soon they will realize that selling CAKE is a bad deal.


I have been with CAKE since day 1. I saw CAKE go from $0.29 to 13, then 22, and reaching 44. 


Today, the protocol built by the devs, who deserve ENORMOUS RESPECT AND CONGRATULATIONS FROM THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY for their work, is much better than when it reached above 40. So, we need to instill more confidence to holde CAKE and to reduce the constant ""every day selling"" from farm´s by those who are only interested in increasing APR. Even these individuals should benefit because with a higher CAKE price, the supplier's CAKE reward will be greater.


Devs... it´s all about CAKE!! Let's empower Ultrasound CAKE with more deflation.",bullish

228,"## Goal of the vote

0x Labs would like to gather signal from the community on whether or not there is support for on-chain governance as proposed in [ZEIP-95](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/95).

## Scope

The forum discussion on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-95-migrating-0x-protocol-to-on-chain-governance-process/3513](https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-95-migrating-0x-protocol-to-on-chain-governance-process/3513)

As described in the forum discussion, there would be a three-step process to the full transition to a new governance mechanism:

1. Deployment of the new governance smart contracts for initial calibration and testing
2. Migration period: ZRX holders can start registering to the new system
3. Vote to switch governance systems: 0x is fully controlled by new smart contracts

This snapshot vote will only give signal on the community’s sentiment with step 1. 

If sentiment is favorable, 0x Labs will continue to develop and deploy the system of smart contracts that define a new governance mechanism — the technical implementation can be found open sourced [here](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/95).

A subsequent vote (ZEIP-95) will be required to officially switch ownership of the `exchangeProxy` contract to a new governance mechanism, completing the transition.

231,"## Summary:

Proposal to add gauge support for a newly created wstETH/ACX pool on Ethereum.

The Across team and community have decided to coordinate around using Balancer as the primary liquidity hub, want to establish strong initial liquidity, and keep the Balancer pool as the core liquidity–as well as encourage communities to be long term LPs. In addition to the Across treasury providing some native ACX rewards to LPs, we are optimisticly establishing this gauge and enabling Balancer and Aura emissions will help this become a strong sustainable liquidity solution for the protocol and community.

## Protocol Description:

Across is an optimistic insured bridge that relies on a decentralized group of relayers to fulfill user deposit requests from EVM to EVM networks. Relayer funds are insured by liquidity providers in a single pool on Ethereum and refunds are processed via the UMA Optimistic Oracle.

Designed by the engineers who built UMA, Across was the result of approaching bridging not only as a technical concern but as a financial engineering concern.

## Motivation:

Across’ goal is to become the most-used bridge in Web3. Previously we have listed BAL as a bridgeable asset on Across and this is another step in strengthening the relationship between the two protocols. In addition, this pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for Across and its ACX token. Overall, this will further the relationship between protocols and create a great liquidity solution for Across.

Specifications:

1. Governance: The Across governance model can be found here: https://docs.across.to/governance/governance-model. The current multi-sig setup will be replaced with an optimistic governance tool that was created by UMA and Snapshot in the next few months, provided that it is in production as planned.

2. Oracles: Across is secured by UMA’s optimistic oracle. More information can be found here: https://docs.umaproject.org/protocol-overview/how-does-umas-oracle-work#optimistic-oracle

3. Audits: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/uma-across-v2-audit/

4. Centralization vectors: Across’s rebalancing is done by a bot that is run by the foundation. Presently the bot is not profitable to run, so we would not expect anyone else to run it. However, there is no chance of money being inaccessible as a result of the bot stopping–Just that the bridge would run less efficiently.

Otherwise, no other centralization vectors listed apply to Across.
5. Market History: ACX has recently launched and doesn't have much market history at this time. Gauge address is 0x89F65570Ac019f86E145c501023e2ef7010D155B. Pool address is 0x798b112420AD6391A4129Ac25eF59663a44C88bB.

6. Value: This pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for Across and the ACX token. In addition, Across sees value in alignment with others in the ecosystem and sees potential and value in doing so with Balancer",bullish

## Protocol Description:

Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a DAO and started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.

Inverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;

* On the supply side of money markets, such as DAO-owned protocol FiRM, by Inverse Finance’s “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.
* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA/FraxBP through our Convex Fed, DOLA/USDC on Velodrome, and previously DOLA/bb-a-USD on Balancer.
* Via purchase with DAI stablecoin using The Stabilizer.

DOLA is not “algorithmic” and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.

## Motivation:

This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the DOLA/USDC stable pool. Inverse has previously obtained a veBAL gauge for the [INV/DOLA](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x0678e2094fa6b3adf61e319c3000b6080f84d43d7555552510dfd2949fa8c4c0) 50-50 pool and DOLA/bb-a-USD 50-50 on Balancer and this proposal aims to build on this momentum. Following the recent unwinding of the DOLA/bb-a-USD LP due to a vulnerability with the implementation of our pool with the bb-a-USD pool; we are once again looking to build deep DOLA liquidity on Balancer. Platform BAL incentives would also help deepen DOLA liquidity as we seek to further alleviate our dependence on the Curve ecosystem for DOLA liquidity. If approved, we expect to continue what was previously done for DOLA-bb-a-USD for our new veBAL gauge and are in coordination with various bribing platforms to facilitate the incentivization and drive the Balancer bribe market narrative.

The Inverse Finance Team plans to continue being a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Once the DOLA/USDC stable pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would once again begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer.

## Specifications:

You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.

Governance:

Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to pools such as the DOLA/FraxBP[ Curve](https://curve.fi/factory/27) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.

Oracles:

Inverse Finance’s new fixed-rate money market, FiRM, uses Chainlink price oracle for its wETH market. Inverse Finance’s old lending market relied on both Chainlink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable.

Audits:

As part of our renewed smart-contract review process, Inverse Finance hosted [a bug bounty contest](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-10-inverse-finance-contest/) on the Code4rena platform to conduct a comprehensive audit of our fixed rate lending protocol, FiRM. Inverse has also recently expanded its bug bounty program by [launching a vault](https://app.hats.finance/vaults) on the Hats.finance platform. FiRM contracts were also reviewed by boutique auditing firm DefiMoon, who have been our [official security partners](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/new-security-layer-a-welcome-to-the-defi-moon-team) during Q4. In addition to providing security consulting and auditing services for FiRM, DefiMoon has also played a role in our recent deployments of [FraxBP Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/66), [Aura Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/71), and [Velo Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/68). In the immediate aftermath of our price manipulation incident, Inverse had hired leading security firm PeckShield in Q3 to perform an audit of our renewed INV oracle, as well as our [bad debt repayment product](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/How%20Inverse%20Is%20Thinking%20Outside%20The%20Box%20on%20Frontier%20Debt%20Repayments). Their report can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWNG08mib2GcI1WqnMt5IdFoW73QU2F8/view).

The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. An announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).

Centralization vectors:

Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:

* Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.
* Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.
* Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 9 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.
* Fed Chair: 2 of 6 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts.

Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).

Market History:

Inverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the “Feds”, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLA’s Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. Please see our graph below of DOLA’s peg YTD.

# Summary

The purpose of Balancer’s locked vlAura should be to augment our successful revenue driving pools while also giving us the flexibility to target particular narrative strategies so that we are able to compete with protocols that have a centralized emissions direction framework.  

Balancer DAO currently has 1,423,058.93 vlAura as a result of BIP-481 https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-481-claim-and-lock-balancer-dao-aura-allocation-into-vlaura/5319
This represents about 5.74% of vlAura voting weight and represents 2-3% of total veBAL votes.  

I propose we utilize this voting power to forward the strategic initiatives of the Balancer DAO according to the following framework.

**40% Revenue Producing Pools**
**40% Facilitating Core Liquidity**
**20% Discretionary Business Development**

### Revenue Producing Pools (40%)


40% of the vlAura will be used to vote for sustainable revenue producing pools.  We define a sustainable revenue producing pool as a pool with predictable revenue production that does not depend on volatility to earn protocol revenue. This would be inclusive of major LST stableswap pools with fee on yield (Lido stETH, rocketpool rETH, frax sfrxETH) and pools with >=50% composition of major interest bearing stablecoin pools (sDAI, sFRAX).  

The allocation strategy will be simple, first we will designate a list of pools to be considered as “core revenue producing pools” which align with the composition described above. This vote weight will be distributed pro-rata according to the revenue earned relative to other core revenue producing pools.  So if pool A earns 30k, pool B earns 10k, and pool C earns 20k, the vote weight distribution will be 50,16.6, 33.3.  In order to simplify voting and minimize dust amounts, we will initially restrict this to the top 6 pools.  

These pools should not be used to further business development efforts and should solely be utilized to promote DAO revenue.  


### Facilitating Core Liquidity/Bootstrapping (40%)

A very important part about being a multichain dex is ensuring there is enough core liquidity to facilitate routing through the most important major assets such as WETH and USDC.  Having a Stablecoin<->WETH route allows us to structure liquidity in a way that allows us to route to nearly any asset, assuming there is liquidity connecting them.  The issue with a pool like WETH/USDC weighted is that there is very little incentive for veBAL or vlAura holders to allocate vote weight towards as there are no external incentives and are purely fueled by core pool bribes. Having this vote weight will allow us to spin up liquidity that is strategically important for routing and future revenue potential without relying on philanthropic veBAL voters to vote for it.  Note that there may be some overlap between revenue producing pools and core liquidity, especially as LST’s and sDAI/sFRAX grow their presence on L2’s. 
In the interest of getting this initiative live in a timely fashion, this allocation will have some discretionary components initially but a transparent objective methodology will be put into place.  

### Discretionary Business Development (20%)

This portion of vlAura should be used to vote for strategic partner initiatives that are likely to grow beyond the initial vote weight we assign.  In the modern dex landscape we are competing against projects that have an entirely centralized emissions allocation strategy and this gives them the ability to be nimble in regards to bootstrapping narratives.  We hope that this vote weight will help attract important partners to build their liquidity on Balancer for the long-term by giving an initial boost needed to bootstrap. 
These vlAura votes should not be used to sustain any particular BD initiatives for over 6 weeks and will fall back on revenue producing pools should there be no current BD initiatives. 

#### Miscellaneous:
There is no easy way to automate vlAura voting on chain because it uses offchain snapshot voting.  vlAura also requires submitting votes for every biweekly period, and there’s no ability to “lock in” votes to roll over epoch to epoch.  This means that there will have to be some entity capable of executing on vlAura votes.  We propose that we delegate our vlAura voting power to a Maxi controlled multisig that will then be used to vote according to the above criteria.  All allocations and methodology will be posted on github which will be used as the data source for submitting votes. 

Additionally, Balancer will recycle 70% of bribes collected back into vote incentives on the that generated them.  30% will be sent to the DAO treasury as USDC.

This is a living framework and can be refined in the future to better suit the ongoing needs of the protocol, subject to a governance vote. 

No project can request vote weight as part of their gauge proposal/governance vote.  

### Specification:

Balancer DAO multisig() on mainnet `will:
1.  call the `delegate(address)` function on the vlAura locking contract `0x3fa73f1e5d8a792c80f426fc8f84fbf7ce9bbcac` with the parameter newDelegatee set to `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e`
2. call the `setRewardForwarding(address)` function on the hidden hands BribeVault `0xE00fe722e5bE7ad45b1A16066E431E47Df476CeC` with the parameter setRewardForwarding set to `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e`

`0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e` is a new vlAURA voting multisig deployed across all chains on which Balancer operates.  It requires 3/7 Maxi Signers to sign, with @gosuto being added as the 7th signer.  Details about the setup of this multisig can be found [HERE](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/pull/163).  This multisig is hereby granted the mandate and authorization to:

1. Vote with it's delegated vlAURA in accordance to the guidelines proposed above.
2. Claim all earned vote incentives, sell them for USDC, bridge them to mainnet, and process the proceeds in accordance with the guidelines laid out above:
   -  30% to Treasury `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`

This proposal is adapted from [its original](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-for-a-1m-cap-for-rpl/250) just so that the change would be a valid one according to the current rules described [here](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217).

======

RPL appears to be a coin with a purpose and a real use case.
The $26,465,785 70 RPL - 30 WETH pool is one of the biggest on Balancer and earns BAL at a rate of $10m worth of BAL/year.

Unfortunately it generates very little volume with 24h volumes oscilating in low tens of thousands of USD, last 24h volume: $30,891

A $2m pool would be enough to facilitate low slippage trading for such volumes so I propose reducing the BAL rewards cap to reduce from 10m *to 3m*. I think that the $10m yearly worth of rewards could be used to encourage other, more useful liquidity.

On top of the low trading volumes and low interest from traders, my subjective opinion is that the valuation is artificially inflated, I’m not happy about heavy concentration of this pool in hands of a single liquidity provider (90% single LP, recently >97%). CMC shows that this coin trades >$900k on Bilaxy and >300k on LBank within 24h which I find hard to believe. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rocket-pool/markets",bullish

**Title**: *[ARFC] BGD. Security budget request - December 2023*

**Author**: *BGD Labs (@bgdlabs)*

**Date**: *2023-12-8*

---

## Summary
Request for a budget of $121’200 for 2 security review procedures on Aave, together with a refund of $30’000 to BGD for the Aave Governance v3 extra voting tokens audit.A


**Amounting a grand total of $151'200**.


## Motivation
Part of [our scope Aave <> BGD Phase II](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-bored-ghosts-developing-phase-2/14484#scope-6) is the planning, engagement, and coordination with security partners of the DAO.

During the previous year and a half, Aave was in a pretty intensive delivery phase (Aave v3 improvements, GHO, Aave Governance v3, a.DI), and we thought it was appropriate to have continuous engagement with 2 security firms like Certora and SigmaPrime.

Even if this worked well, and [we still think that Certora should stay with a continuous engagement](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-continuous-security-proposal-aave-certora/15732/4), we also think that there is room for optimisation, and it is a good idea to do more ad-hoc requests for the security budget, depending on the needs.

This ARFC is an initial request, for budget required in the short term on item part of our development services scope, together with another more general we consider pretty important.

## Specification
This request has 3 components, which we want to explain to the community:

---

**1. Compensation for Mixbytes review of Governance v3 tokens**

During the activation of Aave Governance v3 on October 17th, we detected a problem with the voting assets, which required the cancellation of the proposal, the development of a fix, and re-apply security procedures.

Given that it was already audited code, we also decided to do an extra security review by another security firm, Mixbytes.

For the sake of speed and reducing bureaucratic blockers, **BGD paid for the cost of said security review of $30’000, and now we will include on this proposal a refund request for that amount**.

---

**2. Compensation for security review on a feature of Aave 3.1**

Also part of our Phase 2 scope is to do a series of improvements to Aave v3, in order to reach a 3.1 version, from the current 3.0.2.

Generally, we are confident with Certora reviewing all the planned items until now, but there is one exception (an specific feature) to which we thought an extra review was required, and we engaged Emanuele Ricci (@StErMi), a top-level security researcher with knowledge of Aave to do it.
We will be publishing soon everything to be included into v3.1.

Same as with Mixbytes, BGD has paid the cost of said security review of $12’000, and now we include the refund request on this proposal.

---

**3. Engagement with Spearbit for Aave v3 ad-hoc review**

Aave v2/v3 is a production system with billions of dollars in size, and one of the most evaluated protocols security-wise.
However, security is a continuous process, and always worth it to improve whenever it feels necessary.

During the last 1-2 months, we have noticed different security exploits in the space following similar patterns. None of them affected Aave, but apart from our continuous analysis of the system security-wise, we think it is necessary to do an extra round of review in critical parts of Aave, for additional assurance.

We have coordinated an engagement for this review scope with Spearbit, one of the leading security firms in the space, that will involve 3 of their top researchers checking in-depth different components that we identify as critical on Aave.

This engagement is scheduled to start in the second part of December, and different from the others, the payment requested in the proposal will be direct to Spearbit, for an amount of $109’200.

---

From a technical perspective:
- The proposal will send $42'000 to BGD as compensation for the expenses of part 1) and 2).
- $109'200 will be sent to a Spearbit wallet, to compensate for the services to be provided on part 3).

*The final addresses and stablecoins of the treasury to use will be included in the AIP stage, previous coordination about the last with contributors to the financial area of the Aave DAO*",bullish
247,"title: Aave V3 Harmony - Freeze Reserves
status: Proposal
author: 3SE Holdings

Simple Summary
This ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmony’s Horizon Bridge.

This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts.

Motivation
The Aave DAO Community, through the governance forum, has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users, Protocol, and DAO. (Harmony Horizon bridge exploit. Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1

This proposed action is a first step that will protect users.It will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue, by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop.

Specification
If passed, this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze() function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony. In addition, passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change (disabling supply and borrow) as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony.",neutral
248,"Summary:
Proposal to introduce an admin fee. This would introduce a new admin fee to be distributed to veCRV holders.
This ensures all Curve stakeholders benefit from an increase in volume on Curve and it brings an additional valuable feature to being an active member of governance and CRV holder.

Specifications:

Introduce an admin fee
The admin fee would then be directed to veCRV holders, a discussion with two options on how to do so will be added in the coming hours which will then also be voted on the signalling tool.
The maximum current admin fee is 50% of the current trading fee of 0.04%.

Selecting 50% means you wish to see an admin fee of 0.02%
Selecting 25% means you wish to see an admin fee of 0.01%
Selecting 10% means you wish to see an admin fee of 0.004%
Selecting 0% means you are against the introduction of an admin fee

1. Scrap 2% flexible - waste of cake

3: Revenue earnt goes to users who lock up 1year minumum on staking up to 4 years plus staking cake rewards
4. No more minting or very minimal to pay cake stakers only 
5. Launch on zksync. Next arb! Forget polygon, Sandeep has a 50% equity in quickswap, it won't ever succeed.
6. 6. Reduce supply total or change tokenomics. 500m supply is more than enough. Could get away with 300m

252,"Current parameters:
Supply cap: `500k sAVAX` → `1m sAVAX` (proposed increase of supply cap)
Borrow cap: 0 sAVAX
DEX Liquidity: ~$40m

Normal mode:
LTV: 20%
Liquidation threshold: 30%
Liquidation penalty: 10%

E-mode:
Asset: AVAX
Max LTV: 92.5%

**Proposal: Increase of supply cap by 100% to 1m sAVAX (~$23m)**

The current sAVAX supply cap on v3 is 500k sAVAX (~ $11.5m) and has been reached within two weeks of listing.
Due to the efficacy of E-mode, where sAVAX can only be used as collateral to borrow AVAX, protocols built on top of aAVAsAVAX (AAVE Avalanche sAVAX) have seen extensive growth with deposits at max supply cap.
The proposal’s goal is to suggest an increase of 100% to 1m sAVAX supply cap via the fast-track process as outlined here (https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-v3-supply-borrow-cap-management-fast-track-process/8045).

Reasons for increase:

**DEX Liquidity and Conversion Rate**: Despite market conditions, DEX liquidity has remained around $40m across Platypus, TraderJoe and Pangolin. This can facilitate healthy liquidations if ever necessary. However, at the time of writing, there has not been any necessary liquidations of sAVAX on AAVE.

As Liquid Staked AVAX, there exists a pseudo peg to AVAX on secondary markets such as Platypus. Due to the nature of the asset, the conversion rate of sAVAX:AVAX has been quite closely maintained due to natural price arbitrage and a 15-days redemption window.

**LTV and E-mode**: sAVAX has a modest LTV on normal mode, at 20%, where there exists a healthy spread of price deviation to facilitate liquidations if necessary. On E-mode, only AVAX can be borrowed against sAVAX, which is a highly correlated asset with healthy liquidity on DEXs.

**Maturing Asset**: The cap was initially set as it was a deployment of a new pool. sAVAX has been listed for more than 2 weeks (listed 30th June 2022) and has been near supply cap since. As an asset, sAVAX is relatively mature, having launched in February 2022 and having undergone tumultuous market conditions and stress testing.

At its peak, there were over 4.27m AVAX staked within the BENQI protocol, with users claiming over 2.05m AVAX (> 46%) from the protocol on multiple occasions within days as documented by DefiLlama (https://defillama.com/protocol/benqi-staked-avax?denomination=AVAX).
