21," The proposal discusses the use of KPI Options on UMA's platform to divest UNI's community treasury. Here's a summary:

1. A KPI Option is created by collateralizing 1 $UNI token, with the KPI metric tracked being TVL (Total Value Locked). In this example, the starting TVL is $1.5b and the target is $3b by the end of the year.

2. The UNI community treasury can create these KPI options and sell them for stablecoins via a Gnosis auction or other means. The implied value of the option is .5 UNI (current TVL is $1.5b with a target of $3b).

3. The sale funds the treasury with stablecoins, which can then be used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options using Uniswap's AMM pools.

4. At expiry, all KPI options can be settled and stablecoins withdrawn from LP positions.

5. With this strategy, the treasury would have stablecoins (WIN), UNI stakeholders would have incentives to increase TVL (WIN), and stablecoins are beneficial for the long-term success of the UNI protocol (WIN).

The proposal is based on Yam.finance's experience in building synthetics on UMA's platform and managing DAO treasuries. Links to relevant resources are provided for further reading.",,bearish

The legacy StkGHO safety module cooldown is set to zero, and the Merit Program continues as it exists today to incentivize user migration.

2. End of the StkAAVE GHO discount, introduction of the anti-GHO system, and closure of the LEND chapter. This will occur when the GHO supply reaches 175M and secondary liquidity allows a 10M swap size at 1% price impact.

3. Activation of the Umbrella Atokens Safety Module and initiation of the ""Buy and Distribute"" AAVENomics. This will happen when Aave Collector net holdings are equal to 2 years' service providers' recurring costs for the past 30 days, and Aave protocol annualized revenue is at 150% of all protocol expenses YTD, including the AAVE acquisition budget and Umbrella budgets. This will finance secondary liquidity for AAVE, end the Legacy Safety Module, create aUSDC and aWETH Umbrella Safety Modules (if validated by governance feedback), and initiate a buy and distribute program for AAVE.

Key aspects of this proposal include:

1. Diversification of asset categories to reduce dependence on AAVE as a backstop and explore the inclusion of GHO LP assets for rewards from other protocols.
2. A 90-day emission forecast for community feedback, with iterative emission cycles to target specific asset categories and improve correlations between bad debt potential while maintaining a base level of insurance.
3. Capital efficiency improvements through optimizing emission schedules to balance attracting and retaining new deposits for each respective category.
4. Creation of an analytics dashboard to track the effective coverage of the insurance fund under various market conditions, promoting transparency and providing insight into the performance of the Safety Module as an effective insurance fund for the DAO.

   Curve #1 focuses on setting a higher optimal utilization rate and a maximum APY that reduces the potential for extended periods at 100% utilization while maintaining a more gradual increase in interest rates above the optimal utilization rate.

   Curve #2 adjusts its parameters to have a maximum APY similar to the intended APY in AIP-26, resulting in a higher likelihood of periods at 100% utilization compared to curve #1. This curve is designed to mimic the intended APY mentioned in AIP-26 more closely.

   The charts show how the APY changes based on the utilization rate for both proposed curves.

The governance for these pools will be handled differently based on the platform:
- Jarvis has no on-chain governance, with decisions being executed through a ⅝ multi-sig.
- Angle Protocol uses a 4/6 multisig and does not currently have on-chain governance.

The pools will use Chainlink price feeds for EURUSD and computed ETHUSD and EURMAI (ETHUSD / EURUSD and EURUSD * MAIUSD) for jEUR, while agEUR uses only the EURUSD Chainlink price feed.

The pools will be audited by Jarvis (https://learn.jarvis.network/risks-warning/audits) and Angle (https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits).

The centralizing vector for these pools is that jEUR is mainly collateralized by USDC, while bridged agEUR is partially collateralized by USDC.

These pools have been live since August 2021 (for jEUR) and have never traded off their peg. The purpose of the pools is to act as a main route for arbitrages and to facilitate on-chain liquidity, credit without FX risks, etc.

4. Badger does not rely on external oracles and has undergone several audits, including the Quantstap audit for Vaults 1.5 and C4 contests for graviAURA strategy and bveCVX strategy (results pending). Additional audit results can be found on badger.com under ""Security & Audits"".

5. Badger utilizes upgradeable contracts, protected by a 2-day timelock, and centralized entities host the API and frontend. However, they are developing a permissionless IPFS hosted access point for strategy development.

6. The EOA controlling voting in AURA is currently only accessible to 2 senior members of the Badger team and the bot which runs the voting script. Badger will work with Aura to decentralize snapshot voting as much as possible.

7. AURA, graviAURA, and auraBAL are new tokens focused on the Balancer ecosystem without significant liquidity or trading history. The purpose of these gauges is to help build that. Eth has proven market history and is well-traded.

8. Badger is the governance token of BadgerDAO, currently traded in an 80/20 BADGER/WBTC Balancer pool. The treasury maintains additional Protocol owned liquidity on Curve and Uniswap V3, and BADGER is well-traded across several centralized exchanges.

518," The case study presented here compares the performance of the Balancer Automated Market Maker (BAL) pool on Multichain and hypothetically on Across, a cross-chain liquidity protocol.

In the Multichain BAL pool, there were 34 transfers over a period of 53 days, with 14 withdrawals. The sizes of the 6 largest withdrawals ranged from 12,323 to 1,339 BAL, and the other 8 were less than 1,000 BAL. The pool is now effectively shut down due to low liquidity (only 484 BAL available).

If Balancer were using Across, all 14 withdrawals would have been completed without issue, and the relayer would have been rebalanced within 2-4 hours, ready for more transfers. For 12 of the 14 transfers, users would have received their BAL on Ethereum in 1-4 minutes. For the two largest transfers, it would have taken 2-4 hours. Over the 53 days, the Across LP would have been replenished approximately 7 times, allowing for significantly higher volumes of transactions compared to Multichain.

The Balancer treasury currently holds 80k BAL in Multichain. If they switched to Across, the treasury could take back 40,000 tokens, support over five times the volume at a fraction of the cost, and maintain operational status. The fees on Across are approximately 0.12%, compared to a 12% fee (100x more) on Multichain for moving 100 BAL from Ethereum to Multichain. If Balancer treasury wanted Across to have a fee of 0.10% or lower, they could specify a lower LP fee.

Across has three fees: the LP Fee (configurable via a rate model), the Relayer Fee, and the Destination Gas Fee. The total Across fee mentioned earlier is approximately 0.12%, which is the sum of the LP Fee and the Relayer Fee.

Overnight.fi is an asset management protocol that specializes in delta-neutral strategies and offers USD+, a 100% collateralized stablecoin. The collateral of USD+ consists of yield-generating DeFi strategies, including lending to Aave and stable-to-stable strategies.

The Overnight Steady Accord is an implementation of Overnight Pulse that relies on USD+ for yield. In March 2023, the gauge for Overnight Pulse pool on Optimism was enabled following a positive vote. The proposal aims to re-enable the gauge after changes to its codebase.

Overnight Pulse has been successful in driving volumes and TVL (Total Value Locked) to Balancer’s ecosystem, with up to 7M TVL and daily trading volumes ranging from 300-500K on Optimism. The yield was consistently around 12-14% APR, with the majority generated by USD+ rather than rewards.

   Technical Implementation: The integration with AAVE Pools will be facilitated through a dedicated deAaveAdapter smart contract developed by the deBridge team and audited by Halborn. This smart contract uses the deBridge generic messaging protocol and interacts with AAVE Pools across different blockchains. It enables cross-chain swaps, ensuring that liquidity lent from Portals on one chain is always backed by the same amount of asset locked in deAaveAdapter on another chain.

   Proposed Credit Lines: The credit lines to be allocated to deBridge are requested for each blockchain where AAVE v3 is deployed. deBridge is currently deployed on 6 blockchains, and the integration with Portals will help match the supported blockchains. The maximal amount of the cross-chain swap that can be performed by users and protocols in one transaction is capped by the amount of approved credit line, with deBridge paying a 2bps fee on all liquidity taken from the Portals.

   Incentives: An incentive program may be approved by the deBridge DAO after the deBridge token goes live.

   Audits & Security: deBridge has passed four independent security audits by reputable companies such as Halborn, Zokyo, Ackee Blockchain, and Neodyme. It also has a long-term partnership with Halborn for ongoing smart contract audits. There have been no outages, downtime, or exploits/hacks on any networks.

578," The provided JavaScript code is using the ethers.js library to encode the function call `grantRoles()` of a contract named `authorizer`. This function takes two arguments: an array of role identifiers and an account address. In this case, it grants the roles `manageUserBalance`, `joinPool`, `exitPool`, `swap`, and `batchSwap` to the account with address `0xdcdbf71A870cc60C6F9B621E28a7D3Ffd6Dd4965`.

The role identifiers are computed using the `solidityKeccak256()` function, which is a way to generate a hash of a given input in Solidity. The input for this function is an array containing the name of the contract method (in this case, the name of the role) and the interface of another contract (in this case, the `vault` interface).

The encoded data for the call can be found at the end of the script:

619," Title: Aave Proposal to Adjust Slope 2 and Reserve Factor Parameters

   Summary: This proposal aims to adjust the Slope 2 and Reserve Factor (RF) parameters in the Aave protocol. The change in Slope 2 is due to a reduction in the Uoptimal parameter, which lowers the gradient of the borrow rate between Uoptimal and 100% utilization. To maintain the current gradient, Slope 2 is revised higher. This adjustment is made to counteract the increased deposit rate caused by an increase in the borrow rate, without significantly increasing the borrowing cost.

   The proposal also suggests increasing the RF to be the average of proposed DAI and USDC RFs due to abnormally high USDT usage. This change aims to reduce the deposit rate of USDT, encouraging migration while avoiding a substantial increase in the borrowing cost by shifting utilization onto the steeper portion of the yield curve.

   The tables provided detail the proposed parameter changes to achieve these outcomes. It is important to update these numbers before any AIP submission to avoid unfavorable parameter configurations.

1. **Creation of KPI Options**: The UNI community treasury collateralizes 1 $UNI token and creates a KPI Option with a target TVL of $3b by the end of the year, with a current TVL of $1.5b. This implies an option value of .5 UNI.

2. **Sale of KPI Options**: The options are sold for stablecoins through a Gnosis auction or other means, funding the treasury.

3. **Secondary Market**: The stablecoins obtained are used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options using Uniswap's AMM pools.

4. **Settlement at Expiry**: At expiry, all KPI options are settled and stablecoins are withdrawn from LP positions.

5. **Treasury Benefit**: The treasury now has stablecoins, effectively winning.

6. **Incentives for UNI Stakeholders**: UNI stakeholders have incentives to increase TVL, also winning.

7. **Role of Stablecoins**: Stablecoins are crucial for the long-term success of the UNI protocol, as they provide a stable foundation for transactions and investments.

   Key Points:
   - Decrease DAI and sDAI LTV to 0% temporarily.
   - Gradual decrease in LT by 1 percentage point for every 50M in D3M exposure, with a maximum reduction of 12 percentage points.
   - Standardization of LTs and LTVs across different chains to minimize the impact of LT reductions on the likelihood of liquidations.
   - The proposal prioritizes a risk-averse strategy considering minimal revenues generated from collateral usage.

   Specification: Provides a detailed table showing the current expected LTV and LT for each chain, and the recommended LTV and LT (first and last stage) based on the proposed changes.

   Next Steps:
   1. Gather community feedback and consensus on the proposed changes.
   2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.

For Inverse Finance, this is done with INV tokens, while for Prisma, the specific token used for governance isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

   - **Inverse Finance**: The DAO is responsible for governing the Fed contracts that control DOLA supply and demand. A detailed description of the governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). The transparency portal provides a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview).

   - **Prisma**: While Prisma is fully on-chain, it retains minimal admin functions operated via governance. These functions include modifying fees, adding or removing collateral, pausing or unpausing protocol functionality, transferring protocol fees, and adjusting the quorum on admin votes.

2. **Oracles**: Both Inverse Finance and Prisma use Chainlink price feeds for their respective markets. Inverse Finance also utilizes Curve EMA price feeds in some implementations of its FiRM money market. Prisma additionally uses a custom Frax oracle, similar to the one used by crvUSD.

3. **Audits**: Both protocols have undergone multiple audits and bug contests. The audit reports for Inverse Finance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/audits). Prisma has completed three audits from Nomoi, MixBytes, and Zellic, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/prisma-fi/audits). More information regarding security at Inverse Finance can be found on the [risk docs here](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/technical/audits).

881," The case study presented here compares the performance of the Balancer Automated Market Maker (BAL) pool on Multichain and hypothetically on Across, a cross-chain liquidity protocol.

In the Multichain BAL pool, there were 34 transfers over a period of 53 days, with 14 withdrawals. The sizes of the 6 largest withdrawals ranged from 12,323 to 1,339 BAL, and the other 8 were less than 1,000 BAL. The pool is now effectively shut down due to low liquidity (only 484 BAL available).

If Balancer were using Across, all 14 withdrawals would have been completed without issue, and the relayer would have been rebalanced within 2-4 hours, ready for more transfers. For 12 of the 14 transfers, users would have received their BAL on Ethereum in 1-4 minutes. For the two largest transfers, it would have taken 2-4 hours. Over the 53 days, the Across LP would have been replenished approximately 7 times, allowing for significantly higher volumes of transactions compared to Multichain.

The Balancer treasury currently holds 80k BAL in Multichain. If they switched to Across, the treasury could take back 40,000 tokens, support over five times the volume at a fraction of the cost, and maintain operational status. The fees on Across are approximately 0.12%, compared to a 12% fee (100x more) on Multichain for moving 100 BAL from Ethereum to Multichain. If Balancer treasury wanted Across to have a fee of 0.10% or lower, they could specify a lower LP fee.

Across has three fees: the LP Fee (configurable via a rate model), the Relayer Fee, and the Destination Gas Fee. The total Across fee mentioned earlier is approximately 0.12%, which is the sum of the LP Fee and the Relayer Fee. This number will be higher when going to Ethereum due to gas costs that scale up quickly as a percentage of the transfer amount for smaller transfers.",,bearish

Wormhole has undergone multiple security audits by companies such as Neodyme, Kudelski, OtterSec, Trail of Bits, and others. It uses a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism with 19 guardians, ensuring that more than two-thirds are required to reach consensus and verify a message. These guardians are large and reputable staking providers in the crypto industry.

However, Wormhole has faced an exploit/hack incident in February this year. Since then, it has added multiple security layers to prevent similar incidents, such as Governor, which allows each Guardian to set limits on the notional value of any transfer originating on a supported chain within a specified time period. Other features include the Cosmos-based Wormhole Chain for independent verification of source chain funds and an emergency shutdown module.

Hashflow relies on Market Makers for providing quotes and Wormhole for ensuring cross-chain message accuracy. The security of Hashflow has been audited by Quantstamp, Certik, and OpenZeppelin.

2. It also defines three addresses: `GAUNTLET_FEE_SETTER`, `GAUNTLET_AMP_SETTER`, and `BALLERS_MULTISIG`. These addresses represent accounts that have certain roles in the system.

3. It defines two more addresses, `AAVE_LINEAR_FACTORY` and `STABLE_PHANTOM_FACTORY`, which are factories for creating linear pools on the Aave and Phantom protocols respectively.

4. The script then creates roles for each function that can be granted to the specified accounts using the `authorizer` contract. It does this by calling the `grantRoles` function of the `authorizer` contract, passing in an array of role IDs (which are created using the `roleId` function) and the address of the account that should receive these roles.

   - In step 1, it grants the `setSwapFeePercentage` role to the `GAUNTLET_FEE_SETTER` for the stable pool.
   - In step 2, it grants the `startAmplificationParameterUpdate` and `stopAmplificationParameterUpdate` roles to the `GAUNTLET_AMP_SETTER` for the stable pool.

Description: This proposal outlines a new project aimed at improving the Aave Safety Module, named Code A. The project will significantly alter the dynamics of the Safety Module and its components, including stkGHO, stkAAVE, and stkABPT. It will offer more efficient mechanisms, improved user experience, better dynamics for builders to build upon, and have a substantial impact on AAVE tokenomics. The project is holistically designed, taking into account Aave v3 and GHO, and will directly/indirectly benefit any future project of the DAO.

Duration: Approximately 6 months for completion, with iterative delivery and communication over the course of the project.

The team consists of independent contractors, with operational costs kept minimal, containing insurance, software subscriptions, tax/accounting services, and startup expenses for the company. Legal expenses are not included as they will be granted access to legal support from GRC resources.

     - Increase Uoptimal from 90% to 92% for USDC, USDT, and DAI on Aave V3 Ethereum.
     - The proposal is supported by empirical data showing minimal leverage employed against stablecoins, a healthy distribution of supplied assets, and consistent utilization rates above the current Uoptimal.

  2. Motivation:
     - Enhance capital efficiency in the market due to the surge in both supply and demand in stablecoin markets.
     - Align rates with market demand by raising the optimal utilization (UOptimal) from 90% to 92%.

  3. Historical Stablecoin Utilization as Collateral:
     - Analyzing the proportion of supplied stablecoins utilized as collateral to evaluate feasibility of increasing UOptimal.
     - Minimal leverage employed against stablecoins overall, with only $1.8 million worth of collective USDC, USDT, and DAI collateral seized through liquidations over the last 90 days (representing just 0.1% of all currently supplied USDT, USDC, and DAI).

  4. Account Distribution:
     - Examining the distribution of supplied stablecoin assets to ensure ample liquidity for suppliers to withdraw their supply according to Uoptimal.
     - Majority of supplied accounts employing zero debt, resulting in an infinite health factor.

  5. Historical Utilization Rate:
     - The utilization rate has consistently remained above the current Uoptimal by approximately 0.5% to 2%.
     - Yield convergence is observed at a 91.5% to 92% utilization rate, considering the current slope1 value of 6%.

  6. Recommendations:
     - Increase UOptimal to 92% for USDC, USDT, and DAI on Aave V3 Ethereum.
     - This adjustment aims to maintain market competitiveness and reduce volatility in the stablecoin market.",,bearish

2. The estimated gas price is the median from the last few blocks according to the `getGasPrice()` function from the web3 provider, providing a good approximation of the actual trade block's median gas price.

3. The estimated BAL/ETH price is queried from an 80/20 BAL/WETH pool, acting as a real-time oracle and not used to compute the actual award amount.

4. The final result displayed to the user is the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for the particular trade, assuming funds are still available in the budget, along with a USD estimate using CoinGecko's API for BAL/USD price.

5. At dispersal time, the number of eligible swaps is determined, and the gas reimbursement amount depends on this count. The actual gas price is the median from the block containing the trade, with artificially low-price transactions filtered out. The actual BAL/ETH price is queried from CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

6. The only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are minor: the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block, and the 80/20 BAL/WETH price may not perfectly match CoinGecko’s BAL/ETH price.

7. The user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time, improving the overall user experience and potentially attracting more traders to the campaign.

1. The DAO prioritizes peg stability above all else when considering parameter changes.
2. Aave has assigned an overall risk rating of B+ to DAI, the current sole backing stablecoin of alUSD. USDC and USDT strategies will be added as alUSD collateral later. The new risks from introducing alUSD are Alchemix/alUSD and Yearn Vault contract risks.
3. The Alchemix DAO multisig and timelock wallet is the administrator for the alUSD token, with the ability to grant and revoke other contracts the minter role. All minting is currently handled by the alchemist.sol contract, but new contracts will also be granted the minting permissions upon launch of version two.
4. The alUSD price oracle will be served via Chainlink.
5. After a forum RFC and community sentiment snapshot vote pass, Alchemix will push a PR with the necessary payloads to the Aave GitHub adding alUSD to the assets list.

1521," The text presents a proposal for whitelisting a gauge for a pool on Balancer.fi, specifically a FOLD/WETH pair. The proposal is from Manifold Finance, a platform that provides access to high-value transaction pools through their infrastructure called SecureRPC. They aggregate multiple endpoints and mining pools. The motivation behind this proposal is to deepen liquidity as current onchain liquidity is low but volume incentives and bribes have been high in recent days.

The governance model of Manifold Finance uses an elected dictator system, where FOLD token holders delegate control to one address (the dictator) in exchange for rewards. The protocol fees are collected in a vault and distributed over time to prevent MEV attacks. They also maintain a multisig address for voting in governance proposals of other DAOs, which will be migrated to a vault-based permissive action list structure.

The pool in question has seen significant volume since its activation and currently offers a high APR. The proposal includes links to Manifold Finance's website, documentation, GitHub, forum, and Twitter for further information. However, it also mentions potential centralization risks such as the use of a centralized service for governance discussions and the presence of certain account addresses with large amounts of FOLD tokens.

This E-Mode aims to reduce the exposure of the wstETH price on Optimism by using oracles that draw upon the price of wstETH across multiple networks.

The creation of this E-Mode will enable arbitrage opportunities, potentially leading to a tighter correlation between the wstETH price on Optimism and its true value. However, it's important to note that the stETH & wstETH yield is updated every 24 hours, which affects the exchange rate wstETH/stETH, and there are some cautions associated with using wstETH as collateral in E-Mode.

The risk parameters for this E-Mode have been proposed by Llama, with a Loan to Value of 93.00%, Liquidation Threshold of 90.00%, and Liquidation Bonus of 1.00%. The wstETH and wETH contracts on Optimism are also specified in the summary.

2. Utilizing $HAUS for more than just voting within the DAOhaus ecosystem, with future plans to use it as a coordination mechanism.
3. Supporting the utility and value of contributor compensation denominated in $HAUS.

The platform does not rely on external oracles and has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence. The most used smart contracts are instances of the MolochV2.1 contract framework, which was audited, and none of the contracts are upgradable. There have been no hacks to date.

DAOhaus aims for decentralization and has made organizational design choices to avoid concentrating power. Key aspects include:

- Non-upgradable on-chain assets distributed across multiple entities.
- Governance power over key on-chain assets is distributed among various DAOs, with no single DAO controlling more than 10.5% of voting shares.
- Centralization vectors are being addressed by migrating the entire stack to decentralized infrastructure.

Summary: This document outlines the strategic focus areas for the development of GHO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) token, over the next three months. The key objectives include maintaining a 1.00:1.00 peg with USD, reducing price volatility, increasing liquidity for DeFi integrations, growing non-stable coin paired liquidity pools, and targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases. A high-level budget of 500k GHO has been proposed, with the primary focus on peg resilience (360k GHO) and creating utility (140k GHO). Performance indicators such as TVL DEX Liquidity Pools, TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools, DEX Liquidity Composition, Swap Price Impact, Annualized Peg Volatility, and Price level for > 90% time are proposed to be tracked. The document also includes a proposal to swap 250k aUSDT and 250k aUSDC for GHO and create an allowance for 500k GHO.

Keywords: GHO, DeFi, liquidity, budget, performance indicators, strategic focus, peg resilience, utility creation, TVL DEX Liquidity Pools, TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools, DEX Liquidity Composition, Swap Price Impact, Annualized Peg Volatility, Price level for > 90% time.

1610," This text outlines the allocation of collected protocol fees in the Balancer ecosystem, specifically focusing on voting incentives, DAO funds, and veBAL. The fees are allocated as follows:

- 50% of the total protocol fees will be used for voting incentives.
- 17.5% of the total protocol fees will go to the DAO.
- 32.5% of the total protocol fees will flow to veBAL over a period of two weeks.

The allocation of voting incentives occurs per chain and is based on each pool's relative fee generation within the Core Pools List. Pools with less than $500 in voting incentives will be excluded from the round, and their voting incentives will be distributed to the remaining core pools.

The Voting Incentive amount will be split between veBAL and vlAURA voting markets based on auraBAL’s total capture of veBAL. If there is less than $500 available to allocate voting incentives to AURA, all voting incentives will be shifted to either BAL or Aura in a way that tries to maintain auraBAL capture split across the entire set.

The transactions to place incentives and pay fees to the DAO and veBAL are packaged up into a multisig payload for execution. The initial parameters, including vote_incentive_pct, dao_share_pct, vebal_share_pct, min_vote_incentive_amount, and min_aura_incentive, have been set.

The Core Pools List will be accepted as the current configured list of core pools, with changes based on payloads approved by governance. Rerouting of voting incentives from one pool to another has not been configured at this time.

Future changes to the configuration will require a governance vote that includes a payload PR with the specific changes. The minimum vote_incentive_amount may be adjusted up to $1000 USD without a vote in response to on-chain gas costs, while the min_aura_incentive shall be maintained such that any Aura Voting Incentive always achieves well over the minimum votes required on Aura to register for a veBAL vote.

1758," The text discusses a proposal for Phase I of a project aimed at integrating Aave with Starknet, a new and promising blockchain environment. The project's goal is to build a system that allows users to interact with Aave on Ethereum without directly touching Ethereum due to high gas costs. This will be achieved by creating wrappers and smart contracts around Starknet bridges for aTokens of Aave Ethereum.

The project, estimated to take 2-3 months, is led by a team consisting of full-time and part-time members with expertise in both the Aave ecosystem and Starknet. The budget includes salaries, gas costs, audits, bug bounty, and a buffer. Payments will be made in stable assets from the Aave treasury.

1822," This document outlines a proposal for adjusting parameters in Aave v2 on the Polygon network, with the aim of encouraging migration to Aave v3 while complementing the v3 liquidity mining program. The proposed changes include:

1. Uoptimal Parameter: The Uoptimal parameter is adjusted based on the current utilization and Uoptimal values. For example, if utilization is 20% and the Uoptimal is 60%, then the proposed Uoptimal is 40%.

2. Slope 2 Parameter: To maintain the same gradient of the borrow rate between utilisations Uoptimal and 100%, the Slope2 parameter is revised higher when the Uoptimal parameter is reduced.

3. Reserve Factor (RF): As the borrow rate increases, so does the deposit rate to counteract it. To redirect interest paid by borrowers to Aave instead of depositors, the RF is increased. The RF for USDT is adjusted to reduce its deposit rate and encourage migration without substantially increasing borrowing costs.

The proposal suggests that when utilization drops significantly, the Uoptimal value should be reduced in line with other stable coins.

The document also includes tables detailing the current asset configuration on Polygon v2 and the proposed parameter changes. It is important to note that the numbers may need to be updated before any AIP submission to avoid unfavorable parameter configurations.

The next steps include community discussion, where anyone can work with the author to implement the changes.

1928," The summary is as follows:

Balancer V2 liquidity mining will operate in three tiers: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Tier 1 pools will be voted on by governance on a recurring basis, while Tier 2 and Tier 3 pools will be strategically assigned by the Ballers Committee based on community sentiment. The Ballers Committee is a group of active and dedicated members of the Balancer community who have contributed significantly to the protocol. Any engaged individuals in the community can potentially join the committee through elections by fellow community members.

The transition from V1 to V2 will take approximately 8 weeks, with BAL liquidity mining allocations incrementally migrated to V2 on a weekly basis during this period. The weekly BAL distribution will remain constant at 145,000 BAL per week throughout the migration process.

The Ballers Committee aims to provide quick responses according to market conditions and avoid extensive overhead on BAL governance. However, it's important to note that there are potential risks associated with this small group of individuals, such as centralization risks and collusion. The community will constantly assess the participation and decision-making abilities of Ballers, and they can be elected or dismissed by BAL holders through Snapshot votes.

Certain pools may be allocated more than one slot by the committee to tentatively match the APY of specific pools on V1. All community members will always have the ability to signal their support for liquidity mining inclusion for T2 and T3 pools in order to guide the committee.

The upgrade to Balancer V2 is expected to increase gas efficiency, creating a natural incentive for project teams to drive liquidity to Balancer due to its competitive conditions for trading, namely lower gas costs. Some competitors don't offer liquidity incentives at all and still have sufficient liquidity for the long-tail of assets.

1. The recommended reductions in Liquidation Threshold (LT) have varying effects on the amount of value liquidated and the number of accounts liquidated. A moderate reduction leads to $1,970 being liquidated across 20 accounts, while an aggressive reduction results in $4,900 being liquidated across 34 accounts.

2. Proposed changes include:
   - Lowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero, which may curb borrowing by less sophisticated users but can be bypassed due to V2's design.
   - Increasing the reserve factors (RF) by 10% for inactive assets, which would decrease the interest rate for providing these assets and lower suppliers' incentive to supply them.
   - Increasing the Liquidation Bonus (LB) for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10%, to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.

1. Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment that allows developers to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. It's highly flexible, extensible, and community-driven, with a valuable ecosystem of reusable plugins. The roadmap for Hardhat includes creating a programming editor (Hardhat VSCode), contract deployment (Hardhat Ignition), a local development network (Hardhat Network), build/testing workflow (Hardhat Runner), and eventually migrating to using Rethnet and Slang for increased feature richness, speed, and stability.

2. Web3.js is being revitalized into a high-value project, aiming to become a great source of value similar to React in the front-end world but for dapps. The goal is to create a hub connecting community spaces, support spaces, educational resources, extensions, and related projects, combined with an active ecosystem development effort. This will provide better troubleshooting, faster developer training, more reusable code, and the possibility of extending the library.

3. The Nomic Foundation is fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within the Ethereum ecosystem to support these initiatives. The Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from various other organizations and individuals, aiming to raise a total of $30M.

4. The text suggests that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury aligned with the growth of Ethereum. It specifically mentions Uniswap as a potential contributor, asking for a $5M funding contribution from the Uniswap DAO. This contribution is justified by the benefits it would bring to the entire ecosystem, including continued maintenance of critical infrastructure (Hardhat), increased developer productivity, accelerated innovation, and increased market volume driven by new users and products.

2072," The text discusses a proposal to create a new pool on Balancer, combining Balancer's AAVE boosted stable coin liquidity (bb-a-USD) with Stargate's governance token (STG). This partnership aims to support multichain dominance across the DeFi landscape, benefiting both parties by providing optimized liquidity and aligning market capture strategies. The pool will earn protocol fees for Balancer, incentivizing TVL growth and trading volume.

The proposal involves interactions with various contracts and addresses, as specified in the text.",,bearish
2073," The case study presented here compares the performance of the Balancer Automated Market Maker (BAL) pool on Multichain and hypothetically on Across, a cross-chain liquidity protocol.

In the Multichain BAL pool, there were 34 transfers over a period of 53 days, with 14 withdrawals. The sizes of the 6 largest withdrawals ranged from 12,323 to 1,339 BAL, and the other 8 were less than 1,000 BAL. The pool is now effectively shut down due to low liquidity (only 484 BAL available).

If Balancer were using Across, all 14 withdrawals would have been completed without issue, and the relayer would have been rebalanced within 2-4 hours, ready for more transfers. For 12 of the 14 transfers, users would have received their BAL on Ethereum in 1-4 minutes. For the two largest transfers, it would have taken 2-4 hours. Over the 53 days, the Across LP would have been replenished approximately 7 times, allowing for significantly higher volumes of transactions compared to Multichain.

The Balancer treasury currently holds 80k BAL in Multichain. If they switched to Across, the treasury could take back 40,000 tokens, support over five times the volume at a fraction of the cost, and maintain operational status. The fees on Across are approximately 0.12%, compared to a 12% fee (100x more) on Multichain for moving 100 BAL from Ethereum to Multichain. If Balancer treasury wanted Across to have a fee of 0.10% or lower, they could specify a lower LP fee.

Across has three fees: the LP Fee (configurable via a rate model), the Relayer Fee, and the Destination Gas Fee. The total Across fee mentioned earlier is approximately 0.12%, which is the sum of the LP Fee and the Relayer Fee. This number will be higher when going to Ethereum due to gas costs that scale up quickly as a percentage of the transfer amount for smaller transfers.",,bearish

   This proposal outlines the steps for consolidating various assets within the Aave protocol, specifically focusing on the Aave Collector Consolidation and performing swaps to achieve a minimum balance of specific aEthUSDC and aEthUSDT.

   Part B of this proposal includes the following actions:

   1. Swap all DAI to USDT
   2. Swap 0.70M USDC to USDT
   3. Deposit the received USDT from Polygon and swap it into Aave v3
   4. Deposit USDC received from Polygon, minus 0.70M, into Aave v3

1. Granting funds in $HAUS to increase the stability of the token price.
2. Utilizing $HAUS for more than just voting within the DAOhaus ecosystem, with future plans to use it as a coordination mechanism.
3. Supporting the utility and value of contributor compensation denominated in $HAUS.

The platform does not rely on external oracles and has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence. The most used smart contracts are instances of the MolochV2.1 contract framework, which was audited, and none of the contracts are upgradable. There have been no hacks to date.

DAOhaus aims for decentralization and has made organizational design choices to avoid concentrating power. Key aspects include:

- Non-upgradable on-chain assets distributed across multiple entities.
- Governance power over key on-chain assets is distributed among various DAOs, with no single DAO controlling more than 10.5% of voting shares.
- Centralization vectors are being addressed by migrating the entire stack to decentralized infrastructure.

2081,"1INCH (1inch Network) is an ERC-20 token launched on December 23, 2020, with a significant trading volume of over $250B and approximately 3M users. The token is governed by around 88,475 wallets, while the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance, is held by around 5,391 wallets.

The 1inch Foundation, which holds a significant portion of the 1INCH tokens, has transferred out most of them, with an approximate value of $15M at the time of writing. The foundation's wallet is a 2 of 3 multisig, and all three signers have other wallets worth similar values. On April 6, 2022, the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.

There are extensive audits available on Github for review. Relevant addresses can be found in the links provided.

In terms of counterparty risk, 1inch is a permissionless protocol where token holders do not have direct control over governance. However, they can stake their tokens to participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. st1INCH token holders receive up to 100% of gas expenses refunded based on their stake size.

Users who stake 1INCH receive non-transferrable st1INCH tokens for governance purposes. If a malicious actor were to borrow 1INCH, stake it for st1INCH, and then attempt to attack the DAO's treasury, the Treasury Multisig 7 of 12 can veto the proposal during the 72-hour timelock period post successful Snapshot vote.
