196," The text describes a partnership between Uniswap and Celo, two blockchain platforms, to promote the growth of green asset liquidity pools and natural capital backed currencies. This collaboration aims to democratize carbon offsetting by tokenizing assets representing real-world natural resources like forests and carbon credits, allowing individuals and businesses to purchase them.

The Celo Reserve, which grows with demand for its stable currencies, will allocate up to 40% of its funds towards green assets over time. This allocation creates a feedback mechanism, where increased adoption of Celo stable currencies generates demand for additional green assets, thereby preserving rainforests and other carbon-sequestering resources.

Uniswap is proposed as a decentralized exchange to rebalance the Celo Reserve, especially for green assets like tokenized land, forests, and carbon credits. Uniswap's concentrated liquidity mechanism will be beneficial for Celo's stablecoins that trade within a small price range.

The Celo Foundation has committed $10M of CELO in Uniswap-specific user incentives and grants on Celo to promote the development of a mobile-first ecosystem, make Uniswap more accessible, especially in markets lacking basic financial tools, and support projects launching and driving the growth of ""green assets.""

The success of this project will be measured by the percentage of the Celo Reserve allocated to green assets, the total TVL (Total Value Locked) and TVL of associated green assets, and the impact of green assets in terms of CO2 avoided or removed from the atmosphere. The goal is to allocate $200M USD in green assets, achieve a 10x increase in Celo Reserve green asset holdings in circulation as LP, and avoid or remove 17M tons of CO2 from the atmosphere.

221,"1. Consensus Protocol: Celer Network uses a State Guardian Network (SGN) consensus protocol that grows in economic security with the staked CELR's value. In case more than two-thirds of validators behave maliciously, Celer has a second security model inspired by the Optimistic Rollup design for added protection. This model uses a two-phase commit-confirm pattern to process inter-chain messages, with a delay buffer before any application consumes the message. During this delay, a dApp can run an App Guardian service to double-validate the message on the source chain and check its authenticity.

2. Security: The bridge in Celer Network leverages the security of the source chain (e.g., Ethereum L1) and operates under a trust-any model as described in the security model section. It does not depend on any single third-party entity or a majority of decentralized parties.

3. Fraudulent Messages: In the Optimistic-rollup-style model, it is not possible to pass a fraudulent message to the destination chain as long as at least one app guardian is trustworthy.

4. Ramifications of Fraud: The malicious actor's CELR stake will be slashed if they engage in fraudulent activities.

5. Audits and Vulnerabilities: Celer has been audited by Certik, Slowmist, and Peckshield with no vulnerabilities identified. There is a $2M standing bug bounty on Immunefi that remains unclaimed.

  2. **Ramifications of fraud**: In case of fraud, there would be reputational damage for both LayerZero and Chainlink. If Uniswap controls the messaging stack by running either the oracle or relayer, it would be held accountable for any malicious activity. Censorship resistance is a key feature of LayerZero, meaning that oracles and relayers cannot censor messages without censoring all messages. Any attempt to censor a message would halt the entire voting process, but Uniswap could resolve this issue by updating configurations.

328," The provided tables represent two proposed interest rate models (Curve #1 and Curve #2) for a decentralized lending and borrowing platform like Aave. Both curves aim to address the over-approximation of an existing 10,000% interest curve by reducing the Slope2 parameter.

   Curve #1 focuses on setting a higher optimal utilization rate and a maximum APY that reduces the potential for extended periods at 100% utilization while maintaining a more gradual increase in interest rates above the optimal utilization rate.

   Curve #2 adjusts its parameters to have a maximum APY similar to the intended APY in AIP-26, resulting in a higher likelihood of periods at 100% utilization compared to curve #1. This curve is designed to mimic the intended APY mentioned in AIP-26 more closely.

   The charts show how the APY changes based on the utilization rate for both proposed curves. As the utilization rate increases, so does the APY, with significant jumps occurring around the optimal utilization rate (80% in this case). Both curves have a maximum effective APY of 10151.40%, which is derived from the provided Slope2 parameter and the given optimal utilization rate.

416," This text provides an overview of the security considerations, risks, and proposed risk parameters for a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform called StakeWise. The platform is designed to allow users to stake their ETH and earn rETH2 in return.

   *Counterparty risks* are mitigated by using an Oracle network to accurately report daily staking rewards. Currently, there are 5 oracles live on the network, with plans to increase this number to 10 over the coming months. The protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO, which has additional security features in place to prevent malicious transactions.

   *Staking risks* such as slashing events and downtime penalties are mitigated through vetting of prospective node operators, providing them with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, and working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance (expected by early May). The StakeWise DAO also controls the exit signatures for its operators, making it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage.

   *Smart contract risks* are mitigated through audits by 3 separate auditors and a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI. The protocol's code is open-source and available on GitHub.

   The proposed risk parameters for sETH2 include an LTV of 70%, a liquidation threshold of 75%, a liquidation bonus of 7.5%, and a reserve factor of 10%. These parameters are presented in comparison to those of ETH and are similar to the current risk parameters of stETH. The interest rate model for sETH2 includes a UOptimal of 50%, a base of 0%, slope 1 of 8%, and slope 2 of 200%.

   Technical Implementation: The integration with AAVE Pools will be facilitated through a dedicated deAaveAdapter smart contract developed by the deBridge team and audited by Halborn. This smart contract uses the deBridge generic messaging protocol and interacts with AAVE Pools across different blockchains. It enables cross-chain swaps, ensuring that liquidity lent from Portals on one chain is always backed by the same amount of asset locked in deAaveAdapter on another chain.

   Proposed Credit Lines: The credit lines to be allocated to deBridge are requested for each blockchain where AAVE v3 is deployed. deBridge is currently deployed on 6 blockchains, and the integration with Portals will help match the supported blockchains. The maximal amount of the cross-chain swap that can be performed by users and protocols in one transaction is capped by the amount of approved credit line, with deBridge paying a 2bps fee on all liquidity taken from the Portals.

   Incentives: An incentive program may be approved by the deBridge DAO after the deBridge token goes live.

   Audits & Security: deBridge has passed four independent security audits by reputable companies such as Halborn, Zokyo, Ackee Blockchain, and Neodyme. It also has a long-term partnership with Halborn for ongoing smart contract audits. There have been no outages, downtime, or exploits/hacks on any networks.

424,"1INCH (1inch Network) is an ERC-20 token launched on December 23, 2020, with a significant trading volume of over $250B and approximately 3M users. The token is governed by around 88,475 wallets, while the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance, is held by around 5,391 wallets.

The 1inch Foundation, which holds a significant portion of the 1INCH tokens, has transferred out most of them, with an approximate value of $15M at the time of writing. The foundation's wallet is a 2 of 3 multisig, and all three signers have other wallets worth similar values. On April 6, 2022, the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.

There are extensive audits available on Github for review. Relevant addresses can be found in the links provided.

In terms of counterparty risk, 1inch is a permissionless protocol where token holders do not have direct control over governance. However, they can stake their tokens to participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. st1INCH token holders receive up to 100% of gas expenses refunded based on their stake size.

Users who stake 1INCH receive non-transferrable st1INCH tokens for governance purposes. If a malicious actor were to borrow 1INCH, stake it for st1INCH, and then attempt to attack the DAO's treasury, the Treasury Multisig 7 of 12 can veto the proposal during the 72-hour timelock period post successful Snapshot vote. This measure provides a level of protection for the DAO’s Treasury funds, which are held in USDC.

518," Here's a summary of the risk analysis report for [rETH] Collateral Onboarding on Rocket Pool:

- Isolation Mode: No, as enabling isolation mode would exclude potential use cases for rETH collateral in WETH or wstETH and delay understanding rETH dynamics on Aave markets.
- Borrowable: Yes, to allow rETH usage while mitigating risks via stringent borrow caps.
- LT (Liquidation Threshold): 74%

- Base: 0
- Slope 1: 0.07
- Uoptimal: 0.45
- Slope 2: 3.0
- Reserve Factor: 0.15

These parameters create an interest rate curve that increases linearly from 0% at 0% utilization to 7% at 45% utilization, and then linearly to 307% at 100% utilization. This design aims to reduce the chances of utilization reaching 100%, which would prevent stakers from withdrawing rETH and prevent liquidators from seizing rETH collateral during liquidations.",14.756097560975604,neutral

Wormhole has undergone multiple security audits by companies such as Neodyme, Kudelski, OtterSec, Trail of Bits, and others. It uses a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism with 19 guardians, ensuring that more than two-thirds are required to reach consensus and verify a message. These guardians are large and reputable staking providers in the crypto industry.

However, Wormhole has faced an exploit/hack incident in February this year. Since then, it has added multiple security layers to prevent similar incidents, such as Governor, which allows each Guardian to set limits on the notional value of any transfer originating on a supported chain within a specified time period. Other features include the Cosmos-based Wormhole Chain for independent verification of source chain funds and an emergency shutdown module.

Hashflow relies on Market Makers for providing quotes and Wormhole for ensuring cross-chain message accuracy. The security of Hashflow has been audited by Quantstamp, Certik, and OpenZeppelin.

584," This document outlines a proposal for adjusting parameters in Aave v2 on the Polygon network, with the aim of encouraging migration to Aave v3 while complementing the v3 liquidity mining program. The proposed changes include:

1. Uoptimal Parameter: The Uoptimal parameter is adjusted based on the current utilization and Uoptimal values. For example, if utilization is 20% and the Uoptimal is 60%, then the proposed Uoptimal is 40%.

2. Slope 2 Parameter: To maintain the same gradient of the borrow rate between utilisations Uoptimal and 100%, the Slope2 parameter is revised higher when the Uoptimal parameter is reduced.

3. Reserve Factor (RF): As the borrow rate increases, so does the deposit rate to counteract it. To redirect interest paid by borrowers to Aave instead of depositors, the RF is increased. The RF for USDT is adjusted to reduce its deposit rate and encourage migration without substantially increasing borrowing costs.

The proposal suggests that when utilization drops significantly, the Uoptimal value should be reduced in line with other stable coins.

The document also includes tables detailing the current asset configuration on Polygon v2 and the proposed parameter changes. It is important to note that the numbers may need to be updated before any AIP submission to avoid unfavorable parameter configurations.

585," This recap compares two strategies for Aave to participate in Curve Governance: one involving delegating veSDT through Stake DAO, and the other holding aCRV on v3 Liquidity Pools (NAE).

The first strategy, using veSDT delegated through Stake DAO, offers a 1.14x boost in voting power for 1 year. However, once the delegation period ends, the voting power drops back to 0.61x. The DAO would control 5,403 CRV of emission per week, representing $266.9K per year with 270k veSDT boost delegated. This strategy adds extra smart contract risks and counterparty risk through reliance on ACI and others for veSDT support. It also has a high-risk asset profile due to limited liquidity ($3.8M) of sdCRV, which could potentially depeg.

The second strategy, holding all CRV positions in the form of aCRV, represents the ""do nothing"" approach and minimizes smart contract exposure to the Aave protocol. This strategy would allow Aave to focus on accumulating active voting power and managing the position. Llama suggests Option 1) for focusing on accumulating active voting power and enabling Aave to determine how to manage the position.

613," Title: Aave Proposal to Adjust Slope 2 and Reserve Factor Parameters

   Summary: This proposal aims to adjust the Slope 2 and Reserve Factor (RF) parameters in the Aave protocol. The change in Slope 2 is due to a reduction in the Uoptimal parameter, which lowers the gradient of the borrow rate between Uoptimal and 100% utilization. To maintain the current gradient, Slope 2 is revised higher. This adjustment is made to counteract the increased deposit rate caused by an increase in the borrow rate, without significantly increasing the borrowing cost.

   The proposal also suggests increasing the RF to be the average of proposed DAI and USDC RFs due to abnormally high USDT usage. This change aims to reduce the deposit rate of USDT, encouraging migration while avoiding a substantial increase in the borrowing cost by shifting utilization onto the steeper portion of the yield curve.

   The tables provided detail the proposed parameter changes to achieve these outcomes. It is important to update these numbers before any AIP submission to avoid unfavorable parameter configurations.

This E-Mode aims to reduce the exposure of the wstETH price on Optimism by using oracles that draw upon the price of wstETH across multiple networks.

The creation of this E-Mode will enable arbitrage opportunities, potentially leading to a tighter correlation between the wstETH price on Optimism and its true value. However, it's important to note that the stETH & wstETH yield is updated every 24 hours, which affects the exchange rate wstETH/stETH, and there are some cautions associated with using wstETH as collateral in E-Mode.

The risk parameters for this E-Mode have been proposed by Llama, with a Loan to Value of 93.00%, Liquidation Threshold of 90.00%, and Liquidation Bonus of 1.00%. The wstETH and wETH contracts on Optimism are also specified in the summary.

719," This text discusses a potential shift in strategy by the Aave DAO regarding its holdings in the Balancer ecosystem. The current holdings are in B-80BAL-20WETH, but there's a proposal to switch to vlAURA instead.

The reasons for this switch include:

1. Max emission power on DAO-owned strategic assets
2. Shorter lock period (4 months compared to veBAL's 1 year)
3. No decay on vlAURA, meaning no need to relock weekly
4. Fewer votes needed for casting since voting are calculated in rounds (2 weeks)

However, there are also potential drawbacks:

1. Limited liquidity, which could be an issue if Aave DAO wants to acquire AURA on the market but OTC deals can be considered as an alternative.
2. Risk of efficiency reduction if the Aura protocol BAL accumulation doesn't follow the vlAURA supply increase.
3. No veBoost on vlAURA, although Aura deposits are boosted with their veBAL share.

The budget breakdown assumes that all strategies will begin to be incentivized at the same time with the maximum amount, but this is not necessarily how it will happen in practice. A 20% buffer has been added to the committee budget to account for potential increases in bribe costs or increased liquidity needs on different layers.

733,"1. Function: Liquidity Provision
   - KNC holders can provide liquidity for the token by pairing it with another asset (e.g. KNC-USDC) and depositing the tokens into their preferred KyberSwap liquidity pool.
   - KNC liquidity providers earn fees from the trading activity that goes through the pool.

2. Function: Liquidity Incentives
   - KNC may be used by KyberDAO as liquidity mining rewards to incentivize liquidity providers on KyberSwap on top of standard trading fees, thereby providing more value to liquidity providers.

3. Emission Schedule
   - There is currently no automatic emission of KNC. All tokens for founders and advisors from the token sale have been distributed since September 2019.
   - ~14.3M KNC is managed by KyberDAO as part of an ecosystem growth fund to facilitate trade and liquidity mining, and other growth activities.

4. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?
   - KNC is an upgradeable token. The overall architecture for KyberDAO is largely based on Aave’s governance model with some differences/modifications such as the ability to enable the creation and voting of multi-option (generic, non-binary) proposals, and enabling the calculation of KyberDAO voting power based on a system that uses the KNC staking model.
   - The DAO has in-built governance safeguards to ensure that any decision or contract alteration will always be preceded by a suitable time period of preparation and reflection, as well as a minimum voter participation threshold. In addition, we have a 5/9 multisig with the role of a DAO operator that assists with operational tasks and ensuring the integrity of the DAO. The multisig comprises a mix of Kyber team members and founders of external DeFi project representatives.
   - The Kyber team alone does not have the power to implement major changes to the KNC token, DAO, and the protocols in the network, without going through a DAO vote.
   - Changes to KyberDAO and KNC can only be made by the KyberDAO via voting on a Kyber Improvement Proposal (KIP).

5. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)
   - Circulating market cap (12 September 2023): $90,543,409
   - 24H trading volume (12 September 2023): $10,065,292
   - Etherscan: 0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202
   - Top exchanges are already supporting the latest version of KNC. KNC can be obtained on KyberSwap as well as centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Upbit, Bithumb, Bitrue, Crypto. com, OKX, Huobi, Bitfinex, KuCoin, Kraken, Gemini, MEXC, HitBTC, Gate. io, and Tokocrypto.

888,"1. Summary:
   The proposal aims to increase the Uoptimal (utilization optimal) from 90% to 92% for USDC, USDT, and DAI on Aave V3 Ethereum. This adjustment is motivated by the surge in stablecoin supply and demand, aiming to enhance capital efficiency in the market.

   - Key points:
     - Increase Uoptimal from 90% to 92% for USDC, USDT, and DAI on Aave V3 Ethereum.
     - The proposal is supported by empirical data showing minimal leverage employed against stablecoins, a healthy distribution of supplied assets, and consistent utilization rates above the current Uoptimal.

  2. Motivation:
     - Enhance capital efficiency in the market due to the surge in both supply and demand in stablecoin markets.
     - Align rates with market demand by raising the optimal utilization (UOptimal) from 90% to 92%.

  3. Historical Stablecoin Utilization as Collateral:
     - Analyzing the proportion of supplied stablecoins utilized as collateral to evaluate feasibility of increasing UOptimal.
     - Minimal leverage employed against stablecoins overall, with only $1.8 million worth of collective USDC, USDT, and DAI collateral seized through liquidations over the last 90 days (representing just 0.1% of all currently supplied USDT, USDC, and DAI).

  4. Account Distribution:
     - Examining the distribution of supplied stablecoin assets to ensure ample liquidity for suppliers to withdraw their supply according to Uoptimal.
     - Majority of supplied accounts employing zero debt, resulting in an infinite health factor.

  5. Historical Utilization Rate:
     - The utilization rate has consistently remained above the current Uoptimal by approximately 0.5% to 2%.
     - Yield convergence is observed at a 91.5% to 92% utilization rate, considering the current slope1 value of 6%.

  6. Recommendations:
     - Increase UOptimal to 92% for USDC, USDT, and DAI on Aave V3 Ethereum.
     - This adjustment aims to maintain market competitiveness and reduce volatility in the stablecoin market.",3.8229060365805716,neutral

   Summary: This proposal suggests a temporary reduction in the LTV of DAI and sDAI to 0% across all chains due to MakerDAO's allocation of a significant portion of potential DAI backing to a new, riskier asset. The proposal also aims to align the LTs and LTVs across different chains.

   Key Points:
   - Decrease DAI and sDAI LTV to 0% temporarily.
   - Gradual decrease in LT by 1 percentage point for every 50M in D3M exposure, with a maximum reduction of 12 percentage points.
   - Standardization of LTs and LTVs across different chains to minimize the impact of LT reductions on the likelihood of liquidations.
   - The proposal prioritizes a risk-averse strategy considering minimal revenues generated from collateral usage.

   Specification: Provides a detailed table showing the current expected LTV and LT for each chain, and the recommended LTV and LT (first and last stage) based on the proposed changes.

This move aims to enable the Kitchen to swiftly establish Farms for trending token pairs, capturing TVL and volume for PancakeSwap, thereby boosting CAKE burn and increasing competitiveness as a trading platform. The proposal suggests that this 1% will serve as an upper limit for ad-hoc Farms, and the farms established using these emissions will be short-term in nature to capitalize on peak community interest in tokens.

The proposal suggests that this approach is more flexible than redirecting emissions from the 'Multichain Warchest', is less operationally tedious, and has a quicker effect. Examples given for successful ad-hoc Farms in the past include Binance Launchpool projects and tokens with trending narratives. The proposal also outlines details of the discretionary CAKE emissions, their usage, and their potential impact on TVL and volumes.

2. The estimated gas price is the median from the last few blocks according to the `getGasPrice()` function from the web3 provider, providing a good approximation of the actual trade block's median gas price.

3. The estimated BAL/ETH price is queried from an 80/20 BAL/WETH pool, acting as a real-time oracle and not used to compute the actual award amount.

4. The final result displayed to the user is the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for the particular trade, assuming funds are still available in the budget, along with a USD estimate using CoinGecko's API for BAL/USD price.

5. At dispersal time, the number of eligible swaps is determined, and the gas reimbursement amount depends on this count. The actual gas price is the median from the block containing the trade, with artificially low-price transactions filtered out. The actual BAL/ETH price is queried from CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

6. The only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are minor: the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block, and the 80/20 BAL/WETH price may not perfectly match CoinGecko’s BAL/ETH price.

7. The user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time, improving the overall user experience and potentially attracting more traders to the campaign.

3680," The summary is as follows:

Balancer V2 liquidity mining will operate in three tiers: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Tier 1 pools will be voted on by governance on a recurring basis, while Tier 2 and Tier 3 pools will be strategically assigned by the Ballers Committee based on community sentiment. The Ballers Committee is a group of active and dedicated members of the Balancer community who have contributed significantly to the protocol. Any engaged individuals in the community can potentially join the committee through elections by fellow community members.

The transition from V1 to V2 will take approximately 8 weeks, with BAL liquidity mining allocations incrementally migrated to V2 on a weekly basis during this period. The weekly BAL distribution will remain constant at 145,000 BAL per week throughout the migration process.

The Ballers Committee aims to provide quick responses according to market conditions and avoid extensive overhead on BAL governance. However, it's important to note that there are potential risks associated with this small group of individuals, such as centralization risks and collusion. The community will constantly assess the participation and decision-making abilities of Ballers, and they can be elected or dismissed by BAL holders through Snapshot votes.

Certain pools may be allocated more than one slot by the committee to tentatively match the APY of specific pools on V1. All community members will always have the ability to signal their support for liquidity mining inclusion for T2 and T3 pools in order to guide the committee.

The upgrade to Balancer V2 is expected to increase gas efficiency, creating a natural incentive for project teams to drive liquidity to Balancer due to its competitive conditions for trading, namely lower gas costs. Some competitors don't offer liquidity incentives at all and still have sufficient liquidity for the long-tail of assets.

3716," This script is using the Hardhat framework for Ethereum development and it performs the following actions:

1. It defines two interfaces for smart contracts, one for a stable pool (`stable_pool`) and another for a linear pool (`linear_pool`). These interfaces are used to interact with specific functions of these contracts.

2. It also defines three addresses: `GAUNTLET_FEE_SETTER`, `GAUNTLET_AMP_SETTER`, and `BALLERS_MULTISIG`. These addresses represent accounts that have certain roles in the system.

3. It defines two more addresses, `AAVE_LINEAR_FACTORY` and `STABLE_PHANTOM_FACTORY`, which are factories for creating linear pools on the Aave and Phantom protocols respectively.

4. The script then creates roles for each function that can be granted to the specified accounts using the `authorizer` contract. It does this by calling the `grantRoles` function of the `authorizer` contract, passing in an array of role IDs (which are created using the `roleId` function) and the address of the account that should receive these roles.

2. Decisions requiring on-chain execution will be performed by the DAO's multisig (Guardians of the DAO, 6 of 10). Initial signers have been nominated from the existing Balancer DAO community.

3. The subDAOs will create learning and review documents at the end of each cycle, detailing work completed, budget spend, learnings for next cycle, and planning undertaken. This report will determine if the subDAO is funded for the next cycle.

4. Risk assessment/mitigation strategies include holding subDAOs accountable through learning/review documents and ensuring that any changes to existing responsibilities are ratified through a Proposal to the community.

5. The Grants subDAO and DAO Multisig already exist within current Balancer DAO operations, with management practices remaining unchanged. Decisions made by subDAO teams requiring on-chain execution will still be performed by the multisig.

6. SubDAOs are not the only contributors to the Balancer DAO, and new teams can form as needs arise or contributors step forward. A Treasury subDAO is proposed for optimizing management of the DAO's treasury funds, with future functions potentially including tokenomics, reinvestment, and diversification.

7. Delegating any new responsibilities into subDAOs will require a new Proposal to be developed.

8. The initial subDAOs are expected to take full effect from February 2022, allowing a 2-month window for processes to be tested and refined before starting a quarterly cycle beginning April 2022.

9. Voting on this proposal will occur on Snapshot for three days following a one-week posting on the forum. The vote is a single choice between ""Yes, let's do it"" or ""No, this is not the way."" Voting ""Yes"" supports the formation of subDAOs within the Balancer DAO, the delegation of defined responsibilities to each listed subDAO, and the establishment of processes for developing, managing, and dissolving current/future subDAOs.",4.397487150199883,neutral

This change aims to address challenges in allocating incentives to new pools without impacting others significantly, as the current system has large drops between tiers. The increased flexibility is expected to lead to better BAL per TVL allocation and spread liquidity across many places. There are no suggested incentive changes for any pools as part of this proposal. The text suggests that this change will empower the Liquidity Committee with more control over rewards distribution, potentially leading towards a Curve gauge-like system in the future.

The goal is to allow token holders to vote directly on proposals and decisions affecting the protocol, rather than delegating all their power to a multisig.

The proposal suggests a 1-week discussion period followed by a 3-day voting period on Snapshot. The vote will be a simple ""Yes"" or ""No"" choice regarding the implementation of veBAL governance.

The text also references several other resources for context, including the original Curve documentation and a YFI tokenomics proposal from Yearn Finance.

3726," The text presents a proposal for Balancer's DAO to implement a standardized protocol revenue sharing model for all liquidity pool creators. The goal is to incentivize developers building innovative solutions on Balancer and minimize governance overhead. The proposed model would be permissionless, allowing any type of pool to divert a share of its protocol fees to the pool's owner or another dedicated address. This is intended to align the interests of the Balancer community with ecosystem partners and encourage growth within the ecosystem. Potential drawbacks include anyone being able to be a ""partner"" and liquidity fragmentation, but benefits include aligning incentives between the protocol and its partners, offsetting pool creation gas costs, and incentivizing new markets on Balancer.

The proposal outlines the potential risks, such as smart contract bugs or liquidation of BAL collateral, and proposes mitigation strategies. It also mentions that Tribe DAO will manage the pool but Balancer retains decision-making authority. The Treasury subDAO seeks governance approval to allocate up to 500,000 BAL for this purpose.

The author suggests that ""soft consensus in the community"" should not be a factor when considering a proposal for a vote, to avoid situations where large token holders support a proposal but the active community does not. The proposed solution is to change the criteria for a ""well defined"" proposal, and implement a required minimum quorum of 100k BAL for any snapshot vote to be valid.

1. Recognizing and rewarding leaders within subDAOs/working groups through a platform called Coordinape, where fellow contributors can recognize good leadership and reward it. This initiative is planned to receive increased budget going forward.

2. Transitioning compensation to stablecoins to protect against Balancer (BAL) volatility and offer more security for core contributors. Each subDAO/working group will be asked to provide 1-3 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that can be used to measure their performance over each quarter.

The proposal suggests that these changes would make the DAO more sustainable, add structure, and increase accountability. The decision is left to a vote, with a yes vote implementing the new system in Q2 and a no vote keeping the existing system for another quarter.

The text also includes projections of how much compensation might change under the new system compared to the current one. If all contributors engage at 75% and do not participate in veBAL discount, the monthly compensation would decrease from $74,800 to $63,750. However, if half of total contributors choose to max lock discounted veBAL, the monthly compensation could increase to $95,625, with a yearly expense of $1,147,500, reducing the DAO’s expected yearly profit from ~$1.3M to ~$1.1M.",11.072664359861585,neutral

3753," This proposal outlines changes for the veBAL Gauge Fix Coordinator on Balancer's mainnet. The coordinator will perform actions based on the chosen community option:

1. Option 1: The coordinator will mint missing BAL tokens for veBAL holders, Polygon and Arbitrum LPs, and distribute them to gauge recipient contracts. It will also set all gauge type weights equally and disable the Liquidity Mining Committee gauge.

2. Option 2: The coordinator will mint BAL tokens for veBAL holders, LPs, and airdrop unminted BAL tokens from L1 LPs. It will revoke minting permission from the current Balancer Minter contract, grant permissions to three new contracts, and set up a new GaugeController. This would require veBAL holders and LPs to recast their votes and unstake/stake in new gauges (gas costs would be reimbursed).

Regardless of the chosen option, the coordinator will honor promised BAL distributions for liquidity providers on Polygon, Arbitrum, and veBAL holders until the proposal is discussed and voted upon. The coordinator may mint additional BAL if needed to cover the period between April 4th and April 21st.

This proposal suggests sending out tiered bribe amounts starting at $0.35/TOKE and scaling up to $1/TOKE using $2MM of BAL for bribing.

2. Reactor Farming + Potential Token Swap + Business Development Efforts: Securing the BAL reactor and token swap with Tokemak would lead to a net gain in all scenarios plus additional TVL captured. This proposal includes engaging in a token swap with Tokemak to seed the initial reactor, developing default 80/20 pools for deployment on each reactor, exploring veBAL program as an alternative to veCRV on Toke/WETH, discussing boosted pools and stable pools as options for exchange assets to increase capital efficiency, and using the Balancer reactor as a means to acquire TOKE for Balancer.

3. Targeted veBAL Education: An educational campaign will be run to dissuade Hidden Hand users from instantly dumping the BAL. This could include an AMA with Tokemak/Redacted communities and targeted Twitter threads.

Risks associated with this plan include bribe insufficiency, smart contract risk, and potential exploits. However, these risks are mitigated by the current market conditions, previous audits of both projects, and insurance coverage via InsurAce.",-23.475609756097562,bearish

3850," The text presents a proposal for whitelisting a gauge for a pool on Balancer.fi, specifically a FOLD/WETH pair. The proposal is from Manifold Finance, a platform that provides access to high-value transaction pools through their infrastructure called SecureRPC. They aggregate multiple endpoints and mining pools. The motivation behind this proposal is to deepen liquidity as current onchain liquidity is low but volume incentives and bribes have been high in recent days.

The governance model of Manifold Finance uses an elected dictator system, where FOLD token holders delegate control to one address (the dictator) in exchange for rewards. The protocol fees are collected in a vault and distributed over time to prevent MEV attacks. They also maintain a multisig address for voting in governance proposals of other DAOs, which will be migrated to a vault-based permissive action list structure.

The pool in question has seen significant volume since its activation and currently offers a high APR. The proposal includes links to Manifold Finance's website, documentation, GitHub, forum, and Twitter for further information. However, it also mentions potential centralization risks such as the use of a centralized service for governance discussions and the presence of certain account addresses with large amounts of FOLD tokens.

3857," The case study presented here compares the performance of the Balancer Automated Market Maker (BAL) pool on Multichain and hypothetically on Across, a cross-chain liquidity protocol.

In the Multichain BAL pool, there were 34 transfers over a period of 53 days, with 14 withdrawals. The sizes of the 6 largest withdrawals ranged from 12,323 to 1,339 BAL, and the other 8 were less than 1,000 BAL. The pool is now effectively shut down due to low liquidity (only 484 BAL available).

If Balancer were using Across, all 14 withdrawals would have been completed without issue, and the relayer would have been rebalanced within 2-4 hours, ready for more transfers. For 12 of the 14 transfers, users would have received their BAL on Ethereum in 1-4 minutes. For the two largest transfers, it would have taken 2-4 hours. Over the 53 days, the Across LP would have been replenished approximately 7 times, allowing for significantly higher volumes of transactions compared to Multichain.

The Balancer treasury currently holds 80k BAL in Multichain. If they switched to Across, the treasury could take back 40,000 tokens, support over five times the volume at a fraction of the cost, and maintain operational status. The fees on Across are approximately 0.12%, compared to a 12% fee (100x more) on Multichain for moving 100 BAL from Ethereum to Multichain. If Balancer treasury wanted Across to have a fee of 0.10% or lower, they could specify a lower LP fee.

Across has three fees: the LP Fee (configurable via a rate model), the Relayer Fee, and the Destination Gas Fee. The total Across fee mentioned earlier is approximately 0.12%, which is the sum of the LP Fee and the Relayer Fee. This number will be higher when going to Ethereum due to gas costs that scale up quickly as a percentage of the transfer amount for smaller transfers.",2.450229709035224,neutral

5. jBRL has been live since February 2022 on the BNB Chain and experienced issues during the FTX crisis due to supply imbalance. The issue was resolved by withdrawing jBRL from the money market, forcing users to repay their loans by buying jBRL from the Liquidity Pool. BRZ also faced peg issues due to its primary off-chain market being on FTX. Both stablecoins have maintained their peg since the pool launch.

The governance for these pools will be handled differently based on the platform:
- Jarvis has no on-chain governance, with decisions being executed through a ⅝ multi-sig.
- Angle Protocol uses a 4/6 multisig and does not currently have on-chain governance.

The pools will use Chainlink price feeds for EURUSD and computed ETHUSD and EURMAI (ETHUSD / EURUSD and EURUSD * MAIUSD) for jEUR, while agEUR uses only the EURUSD Chainlink price feed.

The pools will be audited by Jarvis (https://learn.jarvis.network/risks-warning/audits) and Angle (https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits).

1. The wallets interacting with the protocol have administrative functions under timelock and Gnosis multisig, managed by a committee ratified as part of Radiant DAO's first proposal (RFP-1).

2. Radiant fair launched on July 24, 2022, self-funded with no VCs. It became the top lending protocol on Arbitrum with 148.45m TVL before transitioning to v2.

3. The pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for Radiant on Arbitrum and aligns with other protocols in the ecosystem.

4. The Gauge Weight Cap is capped at 10% due to its market capitalization, allowing for enough room for activities like fee collection and distribution back into the gauge via Core Pool Bribes. A voluntary 10% cap has been placed on the gauge to prevent over-voting.

5. This gauge is a traditional gauge, not a single recipient gauge used as part of the ve80/20 program. BAL incentives will be paid out directly to addresses depositing tokens in the Balancer Gauge.

6. The pool contains a 0.5% fee with an intention to participate in the BIP-19 boosted pool program, and all fees earned by this pool are requested to be used for bribing the RDNT/WETH pool directly instead of distributing bribes by TVL as specified in BIP-19.

7. The details of the gauge to be whitelisted include the gauge address (0x19ff30f9B2d32bfb0F21f2DB6c6A3A8604Eb8C2B) and pool address (0x32df62dc3aed2cd6224193052ce665dc181658410002000000000000000003bd).

The community efforts include managing a bounty board, onboarding new contributors, moderating Discord, providing first response to user support, and bridging community inquiries to other service providers. The proposal aims to shift the marketing efforts from Maxis to Beethoven’s team for community development.

In terms of project management, Balancer is leading weekly meetings with team leads across the ecosystem, driving priority roadmap initiatives, and coordinating project dependencies among relevant parties.

Record keeping involves maintaining a Notion page detailing the activity of each controlled multisig, providing documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig for future service providers.

The budget also includes a one-off amount of USDC 10,000 in case a deposit is required for a new bank account. The fixed part of the proposed GRC amount represents 20 hours per month at USCC 525 per hour. This is the USDC 10.5k per month.

The post also mentions that the cost benefit of having an experienced person who can cover multiple issues, jurisdictions, entities and topics is greater than having multiple specialists and having two or more lawyers on a call, all charging per hour. With this proposed arrangement, GRC would support the Foundation, OpCo, B Labs, Beets, Maxis and other members of Ecosystem Council as well as major SPs.

The team consists of independent contractors, with operational costs kept minimal, containing insurance, software subscriptions, tax/accounting services, and startup expenses for the company. Legal expenses are not included as they will be granted access to legal support from GRC resources.

The team is also requesting 62,230.58 BAL to cover commitments made in previous employment packages. These BAL tokens would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.

The budget for BAL includes funds required up front to seed vesting contracts for each individual contributor. The full amount of BAL tokens can be repossessed by the OpCo and returned to the Balancer Treasury upon termination of a contributor’s contract.

4174," This proposal aims to optimize the launch of Aura by adopting a modified version of Balancer's protocol fee distribution and establishing an Optimism core pool framework.

1. **Modified Version of Balancer’s Protocol Fee Distribution**: The proposed 65/35 fee distribution structure will see 65% of fees used as incentives on the vote market for Optimism pools, while 35% goes to DAOs with an equal split between Beethoven X and Balancer. This could potentially increase voting incentives for vlAura voters, especially if Aura's OP grant is also approved.

2. **Optimism Core Pool Framework**: The Optimism deployment will follow the existing Balancer Core Pool Framework but distribute incentives based on fees generated over the previous two weeks instead of TVL. This change aims to provide a more accurate distribution of incentives.

The proposal is contingent on Aura launching on Optimism, which is planned soon.

4210," The product discussed here is Bloom's TBYs yield generation pools, which are designed to provide superior risk-adjusted yields compared to traditional off-chain financial products. This is achieved by leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies and smart contracts to create a peer-to-peer lending platform that generates returns from the iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF (TBYs).

Key features of the TBYs pools include:

1. **Governance:** Currently, there is no token or governance for Bloom, with changes being made by the core team and a council of DeFi advisors. However, the protocol is fully decentralized, with funds protected from misappropriation. In emergencies where a pool cannot advance to the next stage, an admin/multisig can handle refunds.

2. **Oracles:** Chainlink provides the ib01 and USDC oracles for price feeds.

3. **Audits:** The protocol has undergone audits, with details available at docs.bloom.garden/audit.

4. **Centralization vectors:** While there are centralized components to start the process and manage issuer relationships, transactions themselves are fully decentralized.

5. **Market History:** The underlying asset, TBYs, is managed by Blackrock and has low volatility due to its nature as a bond ETF. In case of oracle failure, circuit breakers are in place.

6. **Value:** These pools will be the primary source of liquidity for Balancer and Aura, with consistent fees generated from transactions within the pools. The pools aim to provide superior risk-adjusted yields compared to traditional financial products, benefiting users and contributing to the growth of the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.

You can find more information about the TBYs pools at [docs.bloom.garden](https://docs.bloom.garden/).",0.4412447747329337,neutral

Overnight.fi is an asset management protocol that specializes in delta-neutral strategies and offers USD+, a 100% collateralized stablecoin. The collateral of USD+ consists of yield-generating DeFi strategies, including lending to Aave and stable-to-stable strategies.

The Overnight Steady Accord is an implementation of Overnight Pulse that relies on USD+ for yield. In March 2023, the gauge for Overnight Pulse pool on Optimism was enabled following a positive vote. The proposal aims to re-enable the gauge after changes to its codebase.

Overnight Pulse has been successful in driving volumes and TVL (Total Value Locked) to Balancer’s ecosystem, with up to 7M TVL and daily trading volumes ranging from 300-500K on Optimism. The yield was consistently around 12-14% APR, with the majority generated by USD+ rather than rewards.

The pool is expected to generate significant trading volumes and fees for Beets/Balancer, as well as sustainable incentives. Incentives are required to grow the pool's TVL to a level where USD+ yield represents the majority of the pool's APR.

The allocation of voting incentives occurs per chain and is based on each pool's relative fee generation within the Core Pools List. Pools with less than $500 in voting incentives will be excluded from the round, and their voting incentives will be distributed to the remaining core pools.

The Voting Incentive amount will be split between veBAL and vlAURA voting markets based on auraBAL’s total capture of veBAL. If there is less than $500 available to allocate voting incentives to AURA, all voting incentives will be shifted to either BAL or Aura in a way that tries to maintain auraBAL capture split across the entire set.

4404," This document outlines a proposal for utilizing the Balancer LM treasury's BAL tokens to generate USDC cash revenues through covered call lending. The key parameters for this proposed strategy are:

1. Notional amount: 25,000 BAL tokens (~$94,000 USD at current spot price of ~$3.76)
2. Upside cap (strike): 110% or 120%
3. Tenor: 30 or 60 days, with the tenor for each transaction depending on the upfront premium to achieve the highest annualized yield
4. Minimum premiums:
   - 2.5% premium on 120% strike (~30.4% APY) and below 4.0% premium on 110% strike (~48.7% APY) for a 30-day tenor strategy
   - 4.0% premium on 120% strike (~24.3% APY) and below 5.5% premium on 110% strike (~33.5% APY) for a 60-day tenor strategy

Once the proposal is approved, the Balancer LM multisig seeds their bespoke vault with the 25,000 BAL tokens, and no active management will be required apart from settling on a quote and creating new offers after each strategy expiry.

The TXAU_TXAG_WETH pool on Polygon does not use oracles, as it is deployed directly on Balancer v2. The other two pools utilize a Chainlink oracle for FX-accurate swaps within a predetermined range of the bonding curve, with LP ratio determining the price of trades outside this range.

The Aurus Foundation, registered in the UK and regulated by the FCA, facilitates the tokenization of tGOLD ($TXAU) and tSILVER ($TXAG) commodity tokens on behalf of precious metal providers like Gold Refineries. Each token is backed 1:1 with fully allocated LBMA Gold or Silver.

The pools consist of the tGOLD and tSILVER commodity tokens, intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the Aurus ecosystem and subsequent alliance partners. The transactions will be carried out by the Balancer Maxi LM Multisig, interacting with the GaugeAdderv4 and calling the addGauge function with the specified arguments.",0.5533854166666635,neutral

4466," The text discusses a proposal for the DAO multisig to update the reward distributor on certain gauges, enabling Inverse Finance and Threshold to utilize Paladin's latest feature, bribe to liquidity mining, for their veBAL gauges. This is due to the current incentives becoming less effective in free markets. The proposal involves granting the DAO multisig the ability to call set_reward_distributor on each gauge/token specified, and then revoking its own rights after the update. The sentiment of this text is informative and action-oriented, with a focus on implementing changes to improve the effectiveness of incentives in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).",1.9939804364183573,neutral
4467," This text discusses a proposal to create four new gauges on the mainnet with a 2% cap for baoETH-wsETH, baoETH-rETH, baoUSD-sUSD, and baoUSD-sDAI. The proposal is from Bao Finance, a community-run project that creates onchain tokenized derivatives (synths) and infrastructure.

The proposed gauges will help kickstart liquidity routing and make Balancer a preferred destination for Fraxtal ecosystem participants. The proposal involves the interaction of the Balancer Maxi LM Multisig with the GaugeAdderv4 to add the specified Fraxtal gauges.",1.0289634146341347,neutral
4469,"1. Centralization vectors: The most centralized facet of the current system is the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON), which is operated by 8 independent Chainlink node operators and 1 price feed from StorkOracle.

2. Market History: The gUSDC asset is tradeable on a Ramses CL pool as per June 15th, with $2M TVL. Since the inception of this secondary market pool, Gains Network vaults have been consistently overcollateralized while the gUSDC asset has never been below peg and has not experienced significant volatility.

3. Value: The pool will not serve as the primary source of liquidity in the bootstrapping phase but will be leveraged as the primary source of liquidity once the bootstrapping phase has passed. The pool can generate consistent fees due to gUSDC depositors only being able to use Balancer as a means of exiting before our epoch system, looping through lending markets & liquidations through lending markets.
