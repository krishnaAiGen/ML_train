   Author: 0xlide - SaucyBlock, dated 2024-02-05

   Summary: The proposal aims to integrate gmBTC (a BTC-USD's Liquidity Token on the GMX V2) as a collateral asset in the Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool. This integration could potentially create new demand for borrowable assets on Aave V3. The parameters for gmETH and gmBTC are provided, with key features such as Collateral Enabled, Supply Cap, LTV, and Liquidation Bonus specified. The proposal progresses through ARFC stages if consensus is reached and risk service providers approve the risk parameters.

It has over 3M sAVAX in circulation with deep liquidity in Automated Market Makers (AMMs) for a healthy lending market ecosystem.

BENQI is a Liquid Staking solution that allows users to stake AVAX to receive sAVAX, which then delegates the staked AVAX to nodes for network validation, generating approximately 7.20% APR. sAVAX can be redeemed back for AVAX after a 15 days cooldown period in a 2 days redemption window.

Using sAVAX as a collateralized asset on AAVE would increase interest earned on supplying and reduce the cost of borrowing due to its yield-bearing nature. It is integrated with various protocols like Anchor, Kyber, Trader Joe, Ribbon, and Platypus.

BENQI was launched in 2021 as DeFi activity on the Avalanche network grew, and it supports another layer of DeFi primitive, Liquid Staking. Over $200M is being staked via BENQI, with over $100M of liquidity across AMMs.

The asset currently used includes over 3M AVAX (~ $200M) being staked via BENQI and over $100M of liquidity across AMMs. sAVAX is integrated by protocols such as Anchor, Platypus, Ribbon Finance, More Money, Trade Joe, Kyber, and Pangolin.

The market cap of sAVAX is $168M, with a 24hr volume of $2.2M. It is listed on exchanges like Trader Joe, Kyber, and Pangolin. The number of transactions is 59,902, and the number of holders is 4,070.

The social channels data shows that BENQI has a Twitter following of 62.9k and a Telegram following of 13.35k. The contracts were deployed on January 27, 2022, with no emission schedule. sAVAX cannot be minted without staking AVAX in the contract, and a multisig is currently the owner of the minting contract, which belongs to BENQI's core team.

The architecture of sAVAX uses a pool share system, and the withdrawal and delegation process is protected in a hardened memory-only runtime environment with no remote access and extremely restricted physical access.

   Authors: @karpatkey_TokenLogic & @ChaosLabs
   Date: 2024-04-04

This publication proposes gradually increasing borrow rates on Polygon v2 to encourage users to migrate to Aave v3. The Reserve Factor (RF) on Polygon v2 has increased over the past 8 months, reducing capital efficiency and deposit yield.

The proposal suggests incrementing the Slope1 parameter for non-frozen assets by 75bps every two weeks to encourage migration from v2 to v3. The Uoptimal will also be adjusted periodically to discourage new debt positions.

For frozen assets, the Uoptimal will be reduced to 10%, Slope1 to 50%, and Slope2 to 500% (except for BAL with a Uoptimal of 20% due to current utilization).

The changes will not trigger liquidation of users' funds and will gradually increase the cost for those remaining on v2. A migration tool is available to aid transition from v2 to v3.

Assets affected: DAI, MATIC, wBTC, wETH, USDC, USDT, BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK, and SUSHI.

The proposal will be escalated to the Snapshot stage if community consensus is reached. If approved, a subsequent proposal will be submitted every two weeks.",bearish,128.5,2024-04-12 00:00:00+00:00,86.86,86.86,2024-04-12 00:00:00+00:00,-0.3240466926070039,115.30333333333331,-0.1026977950713359,small

The VAI Savings Rate (VSR) contract is a smart contract designed to accept deposits of VAI tokens and mint SavingsVAI for depositors. This contract provides users with the opportunity to earn interest on their VAI deposits, while also providing additional utility to the VAI token within the Venus ecosystem.

Key features of the VSR contract include:
- Deposit and mint: Users deposit VAI into the VSR contract, which mints and issues SavingsVAI tokens to the depositor based on the deposit amount of VAI.
- Redeem and withdraw: Users can redeem their SavingsVAI tokens at any time, receiving VAI in return. The amount of VAI received upon redemption will always be equal to or greater than the initial VAI deposit used to obtain the SavingsVAI tokens.
- SavingsVAI: SavingsVAI is an ERC-20 token that represents a redeemable deposit within the VSR contract. The redemption process is guaranteed and immediate, without any lock-up periods.
- Implementation of ERC-4626: The VSR contract can implement the ERC-4626 standard (ERC-4626: Tokenized Vaults), where VAI serves as the resource and SavingsVAI functions as shares.

The VAI Savings Rate contract introduces an additional level of utility for VAI, allowing users to earn interest on their deposits. This mechanism not only encourages the holding of VAI but also improves the overall value proposition of the Venus ecosystem.

In conclusion, this proposal aims to keep the pegged VAI price at $1 by deploying the VAI PEG Stability module and providing liquidity for the VAI/USDT pair on PancakeSwap. The plan begins with the use of treasury for providing liquidity on PancakeSwap and continues with further developments, such as Peg Stability Modules, VAI Savings Rate, and updates to the liquidation sequence.",bearish,7.99,2023-04-14 00:00:00+00:00,6.75,6.75,2023-04-14 00:00:00+00:00,-0.1551939924906133,7.88,-0.0137672090112641,verySmall

The text discusses a proposal to adjust inflation rates for the cryptocurrency SUSHI. Current community proposals suggest drastic reductions in block rewards, which could harm APY for liquidity providers and potentially drive them away, reducing competition with other Automated Market Makers (AMMs). The authors argue that lowering inflation too early could be harmful to the ecosystem, while existing proposals create imbalances among different user groups.

The text identifies three primary user groups: farmers who provide liquidity, holders of SUSHI, and casual traders seeking high liquidity. All are essential for the ecosystem's survival. The proposed solution is a gradual decrease in block rewards over time with less inflation in the long term to satisfy all parties.

The plan includes:
- First month: 150 SUSHI per block and $10mln buyback from funds received from @chefnomi
- Second month: 100 SUSHI per block and $4mln buyback
- Next ten months: 80 SUSHI per block
- Final year: 50 SUSHI per block

This plan aims to reduce inflation significantly after one year, with a slower and less damaging drop. The buyback is intended to offset the impact of inflation on price, and any locking mechanism for newly minted tokens would prevent instant sells of unlocked parts.",bearish,2.629,2020-09-13 00:00:00+00:00,2.18,2.18,2020-09-13 00:00:00+00:00,-0.1707873716241916,2.473333333333333,-0.0592113604665906,verySmall

   Summary: A proposal to enable a pool for staked ETH and USD assets, generating yields regardless of price stability. The pool uses USDe, which maintains stability through automated hedges, and wstETH from Lido, an Ethereum staking service. This pool aims to facilitate easier trading between high-yielding and large tokens on the chain without complex un-staking.

   Key Points:
   - The pool combines 50% ETH staked with Lido and 50% USD staked with Ethena.
   - Ethena and Lido use multi-signature wallets, with plans for decentralized governance in the future.
   - Both platforms rely on centralized parts but are trusted within the crypto ecosystem.
   - The pool's value lies in allowing users to trade without unstaking tokens, especially considering sUSDe's 7-day unstaking period.

1. Collateralize 1 $UNI token to create a KPI Option. The KPI metric tracked is TVL (Total Value Locked), with a starting point of $1.5b and a target of $3b by the end of the year.

2. If the TVL reaches $3b before expiry, the KPI Option becomes valuable, as it implies that the final value of the synth will be 0.5 UNI (calculated as current TVL / target TVL).

3. The treasury can sell these options for stablecoins via a Gnosis auction or other means. The sale funds the treasury with stablecoins, which can then be used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options using Uniswap's AMM pools.

4. At expiry, all KPI options can be settled and stablecoins withdrawn from LP positions.

5. The treasury now has stablecoins, effectively generating funds.

6. UNI stakeholders have incentives to increase TVL, as it benefits the value of their KPI Options.

7. Stablecoins are seen as crucial for long-term success for the UNI protocol, as they provide a stable store of value and facilitate transactions.

Ethena is seeking community support for integrating sUSDe into Aave V3. Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, offering a decentralized solution for money independent of traditional banking systems. The protocol's stable crypto-native asset, USDe, achieves stability through delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral.

USDe has already seen significant usage in DeFi, making it an interesting addition to Aave v3. It is currently the 4th highest volume asset on Ethereum, and its liquidity on Curve is over $100m. USDe's high yield is expected to create strong borrow demand for looping strategies similar to sDAI.

The protocol aims to build a cooperative relationship with GHO, and the addition of sUSDe as collateral may lead to increased borrow demand. Users can acquire USDe through permissionless external liquidity pools and complete cross-market arbitrage by minting and redeeming USDe with Ethena and trading it in external markets like Binance or Curve pools.

However, the protocol is exposed to various risks such as smart contract risk, liquidity risk, custodial operational risk, exchange counterparty risk, market risk, among others.

Instead, it is better suited to platforms like Compound, Notional, or Gnosis that build on top of the Maker protocol's stablecoin.

Maker can scale by returning to its original promise of value creation and exiting the business of picking winners and losers in complex financial and legal arrangements. Stablecoins should remit yield to Maker if they are over-reserved, or else exposure managed by drawing down those reserves for liquid, high-quality public bonds that return all net interest income back to the Surplus Buffer in DAI.

To attract more ETH liquidity, an incentivization program will be implemented using fees collected from the negative supply rate for stETH LPs. The yield amount for this program is expected to range between 10%APY to 20%APY.

The text also suggests creating a new aETH/stETH pool and reaching out to platforms like Curve, Convex, and Lido to increase their reward programs for the next few months. The aim is to grow the yield amount of the Curve ETH/stETH pool and attract more ETH liquidity.

The proposal is still under discussion, improvement, and technical implementation by the Aave development team.

Description: This proposal, put forward by @bigbull, suggests that if a Steward is part of a Working Group and wishes to propose an idea related to that group, they should first consult the group and the Stewards. If the majority refuses, the proposal can still be submitted with a disclaimer. Proposals unrelated to the working group follow the current process without requiring approval from the related group.

Benefits: Clarifies the distinction between personal proposals and implied endorsements from working groups, enhances communication and collaboration among working group Stewards, and ensures better growth of the Working Groups as Stewards have short terms.

Implementation: The proposal will take effect once approved and continue until replaced. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be used to track the number of AIPs initiated by each Steward within their working group and the number of AIPs put up for vote, with updates provided quarterly. Slack will be used for internal votes tracking.

The solution suggests implementing a market-making program with verified providers, offering rebates on fees traded. This strategy has proven successful in traditional CEX exchanges. The proposed experiment involves a 2-month trial with a capped pool of 150k USD equivalent. Verified providers suggested include aggregators like 1inch and matcha, as well as platforms like zerion and zapper.

Author: Marc Zeller (Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs)

Date: 2023-08-09

Summary: Proposal to integrate sDAI into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool as a collateral-only asset. This move aims to create new synergies with MakerDAO ecosystem and offer users dual benefits of earning DSR yield while utilizing assets as collateral. The proposal does not conflict with the DSR integration in aDAI reserve proposal, but rather complements it. Changes in parameters for Aave V3 & V2 Ethereum pools are proposed, including adjustments to wETH Optimal Ratio, RF, and LTV/LT/Liquidation penalty for sDAI and DAI. If approved, both sDAI and DAI would serve as reserves in the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.

1. Forced Staking Updates:
   - Problem: Delay in resetting the protocol due to forced staking updates can take more than 24 hours.
   - Solution: Make a proof a ""public good"" as soon as it is computed, adding it to a common pool of proofs available to all nodes. This avoids issues related to forced staking updates and introduces a new component into the protocol.

2. Empty Blocks:
   - Problem: Proposers can propose empty blocks, which may lead to censoring transactions or damaging the quality of the chain.
   - Solution: Decrease rewards for consecutive empty blocks proposed by the same node, but not for the first time an empty block is proposed. This discourages nodes from proposing (only) empty blocks when not necessary.

2. Verification: The verifier contract on Starknet validates the proofs, ensuring the messages were processed correctly.

3. Results Publication: Once all messages are processed and verified, the voting results can be announced, and anyone can verify their accuracy using zk-SNARK proofs. Individual votes remain confidential to protect privacy.

4. Integration with Starknet’s Governance Platform: ZK Governance will be integrated into the existing governance platform to provide a privacy layer, encouraging higher participation rates and improving the quality of decision-making.

Currently, there is no way to perform this operation within the smart contract itself. In contrast, Ethereum and EVM systems store copies of the code multiple times if the same contract is deployed numerous times.

The motivation for this syscall comes from the need to check a contract's class hash, as seen in Kakarot's use of replace_class_hash syscall for upgrades at the contract level and using class hashes as a means of checking contract versions. This syscall would enable contract-level orchestration of versioning and auto-upgrade for Kakarot Account Contracts.

The proposed API for this syscall includes two options: get_class_hash_at_syscall and class_hash_syscall, both returning the ClassHash if the contract is deployed and an error if it is not. The implementation details are yet to be defined by the Starkware team.

Abstract: This proposal aims to enhance the decentralization and scalability of Lido by adopting mandatory use of MEV-boost middleware for all Lido Nodes (NOs). By sourcing blocks from an open, competitive market, we can maximize revenue for Lido, protect Ethereum, minimize MEV hiding, and reduce Lido's power over block production.

1. Adoption of MEV-Boost: All Lido NOs will be required to adopt the MEV-boost middleware to access the distributed block builder market. This market provides an objective source for block templates that maximizes revenue for Lido and minimizes MEV hiding.

2. Monitoring Compliance: Non-compliant NOs can be identified by comparing their produced blocks with the most valuable known block template offered on MEV-boost (the reference block). If there is a significant deviation, the NO was either not using MEV-boost or engaging in MEV hiding.

3. Punishment for Non-Compliance: Lido can punish gross misbehavior by cutting off non-compliant NOs from receiving more stake from the DAO before withdrawals and off-boarding them after withdrawals via an on-chain vote.

4. Choice of Relays: To maintain competition, Lido should enforce both a must-include list (standard relays that all NOs must include) and a must-ban list (for adversarial relays that no NO can include). These lists can be subject to periodic review by the DAO.

5. Policy Maintenance: Lido should use the most decentralized and competitive implementation of PBS, with the goal of using protocol-enshrined PBS in the future. The policy should be reviewed periodically to ensure it remains on the best solution, with reviews happening at least once a year and increasing in frequency as the block template market ossifies.

2. Monitoring Services:
   - Slashing protection, system monitoring is performed by Swell. No specific monitoring of the core token functionality.

3. Multi-Chain Strategy:
   - Swell plans to expand rswETH to other Layer 2s in the near future via a partnership with Layer Zero.

4. Bridge Mitigations:
   - For now, rswETH is not multi-chain.

5. Token Contract Behavior:
   - No more than one address for the token.
   - Compiler version used is 0.8.16 and SafeMath is utilized.
   - The protocol deals with possible overflows and underflows by using SafeMath library functions.
   - No external code execution during the token’s function execution.
   - rswETH has unique functionality that allows token to be minted (ETH deposits) but burn cannot happen with zero value.
   - Future functionality will allow users to deposit LST which will also mint rswETH.
   - The token is burnable.
   - Fallback always reverts.
   - It does not have a fixed supply, anyone can mint rswETH with ETH.
   - rswETH is a repricing token.
   - No fees on transfers, fees are taken during reprice by minting additional rswETH.
   - No transfer hooks or arbitrary delegatecalls.

6. Price Feed Behavior:
   - Currently using Redstone price feed and will have a Chainlink price feed in the near future.
   - Approx daily internal rswETH to ETH conversion based on primary asset basis (not secondary market DEX trading).
   - Price updates posted when approx 0.01% difference is reached.
   - Not applicable for AggregatorV3Interface functions revert when called.
   - Bytecode of the custom price feed matches an audited version (not applicable).

7. Upgradability:
   - Upgradeable via transparent proxy pattern with a 7-day timelock and 4/6 multisig.
   - Core protocol upgrades are managed by DAO with strict controls in place, all changes are audited and go through timelock, multisig, and deployment is compared against audited code on etherscan.

This release also extended the simulation suite and improved the overall User Interface (UI) of our platform. The name of this release is Museo Nacional Thyssen Bornemisza, a Madrid art gallery.

Multi callee support aims to optimize auction results by developing a 1inch-based callee contract. This feature ensures the selection of the price-optimal alternative and provides redundancy in case of service failure. Users can adjust the selected callee via the UI.

The simulation suite was further hardened and extended, allowing for end-to-end simulations of onboarding a new collateral and liquidating a vault for each supported collateral type. The UI was also adjusted, with improvements to the limits panel during the vault liquidation flow and better number formatting across the entire interface.",bearish,829.0,2022-11-08 00:00:00+00:00,622.0,622.0,2022-11-08 00:00:00+00:00,-0.2496984318455971,739.3333333333334,-0.1081624447125049,verySmall

First-party oracles like API3 maintain the base feeds on the respective destination chains, and liquidations occur in the same manner as they do on Venus with a liquidation bonus being paid out to the liquidator without recapturing anything. The fee charged to liquidators is the only means of monetization for API3, who are incentivized to keep the OEV Network up and running for a reliable experience.

2. The 30-second delay on base feeds is risky but prices are updated immediately when it matters most (e.g., during liquidations). In case of network downtime or slow updates by liquidators, Venus would be subject to the same delay as the base feeds. However, the resilient oracle approach with a primary oracle like API3, pivot oracle Redstone, and fallback oracle Chainlink reduces this risk significantly.

3. Prices can't be updated with malicious data as OEV Network only auctions off updates from the oracles that are maintaining the base feeds, and the 'oevproxy' on the respective chain can only be updated with cryptographically signed data from first-party oracles run by data providers themselves.

4. The amount that can be recaptured is dependent on liquidator activity and competition on OEV Network. While complete recovery of lost value cannot be guaranteed, auctions have the potential to maximize retained value through competition among liquidators.

5. Integration for current liquidators is straightforward with additional RPC calls to OEV Network and including the oracle update within their bundle. Guides and example scripts are available for liquidators to build upon.

6. Integration for Venus is simple, requiring only reading a new price feed and using the already written and available adapters for oracles pointed towards Venus' 'oevproxy' for each utilized price feed. API3 will deploy the necessary proxies in collaboration with the Venus Technical Teams.

7. Payments are made directly to the API3 data feed contract called API3Server.sol, and each dApp has a specific proxy (e.g., Venus BTC/USD) with a whitelisted wallet that is allowed to withdraw proceeds attached to their specific proxy on API3Server.sol.

8. The integration is currently only on the BNB-Chain due to its potential for recapturing, but OEV Network isn't limited to any specific chain and works on all current Venus Market deployments. The integration can be extended to other networks once feasibility has been proven on BNB Chain.",bearish,6.85,2024-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,5.68,5.68,2024-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,-0.1708029197080292,6.283333333333332,-0.0827250608272507,verySmall

COSMIZE will expand the range of expression of Astar's IP and enable existing IP NFTs to be used in the metaverse space or converted to 3D for use as avatars. The team behind COSMIZE boasts high technical skills and past achievements, including recognition as a WEF 2022 Technology Pioneer.

The Floating world serves as an event hall for the Astar community, while the Ground world allows users to customize their rooms and place NFTs within them. Limited events will be organized for specific NFT holders.

Permissionless DVT (Decentralized Validator Technology) operators allow for a more distributed network of Ethereum validators, but they still hold a significant amount of staked ETH on the network. Lido, as the largest stakeholder, currently controls almost 33.3% of all staked Ethereum.

2. The demand for products like Lido exists due to their convenience and ease of use compared to solo or pooled staking. However, concerns remain about the concentration of power in a single entity's hands. Some propose that Lido should self-pledge not to exceed a certain percentage (e.g., 25% - 30%) of all staked ETH to prioritize the Ethereum network over their own financial interests. However, this would require LDO holders to vote in favor of such a proposal, which is unlikely due to potential financial losses.

3. For solo stakers running machines from home, joining initiatives like Lido as a node operator can help decentralize the Ethereum network further by bringing validators out of data centers and into homes. DVT (Decentralized Validator Technology) makes these validators harder to tamper with due to their distribution.

4. The upcoming trial in early 2024 aims to significantly increase the number of home stakers, making it an excellent opportunity for those interested in participating as node operators to consider joining.

Spacesider is involved in several projects related to Ethereum staking, including DVStakers (an educational DVT community), Staking Directory (a community-maintained directory of Ethereum staking providers), and EthStaker (an educational staking community focused on maximizing decentralization of the network).

The main rationale is ATOM's substantial liquidity and integral role in the Cosmos network. To make ATOM usable on Compound, IBC will be utilized as a bridging mechanism. This integration could enhance liquidity, provide opportunities for ATOM holders to leverage their assets, foster stronger connections between Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems, and expand ATOM's utility within DeFi.

ATOM is a governance token that secures the Cosmos Hub through staking, accruing value via network fees and staking rewards. It has undergone several audits, ensuring trust and security. The proposal suggests conservative parameters for its inclusion on Compound, such as a maximum Loan-to-Value ratio and liquidation threshold and penalty in line with Compound's risk management practices.

The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) will facilitate this integration, offering permissionless, secure, modular, and composable connections between blockchains. Composable, the first company to connect a non-Cosmos chain through IBC, aims to bring IBC to all chains, with Ethereum being a significant focus for secure interoperability.

The proposal seeks feedback on incorporating ATOM into Compound to boost liquidity and user interaction, leveraging IBC protocol and Composable's efforts in establishing secure cross-chain links.

   Author: 3SE Holdings

   Summary: This proposal aims to freeze all reserves in the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony, following the exploit of Harmony's Horizon Bridge. The freezing will protect users by disabling deposits and borrowing while allowing debt repayment, liquidations, withdrawals, and interest rate adjustments. This action does not affect direct transfers to aToken contracts.

   Motivation: The Aave DAO community has reached a consensus to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and minimize impact on users, the Protocol, and the DAO due to the Horizon Bridge exploit.

   This initial step will provide flexibility for further action, such as interest rate adjustments or other measures as the situation evolves.

   Specification: If passed, this proposal will instruct the Aave Guardian to use the setReserveFreeze() function on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony.

StarSwap is a unique DEX that incorporates NFT governance, addressing the utility issue in the NFT space. It will offer standard DEX features along with speed and low transaction fees provided by Astar Network.

StarCards, an NFT platform feature, allows regular community members to govern the DEX and earn trading fees. All trading fees will be distributed among StarCards holders. Additionally, StarSwap aims to provide other NFT projects on Astar Network with a use case for their collectors.

StarSwap introduces an NFT staking feature that allows NFT projects to apply for inclusion and lets the community vote on whether to include them. This gives the community control over the DEX's operation. StarCards is a collection of 3000 NFTs launching in three phases, with the first phase starting on May 5th, 2022.

Afloat is a platform designed to revolutionize the entertainment industry, addressing issues such as low compensation for 3D artists, lack of credit, and competitive bidding leading to studio bankruptcy. The platform aims to create a sustainable ecosystem for 3D artists by managing ownership, monetization, and creation of 3D assets and projects.

The Afloat Network is built using Substrate WASM, Astar zkEVM, Rust, Ink, zkEVM, XVM, and IPFS. It bridges to various ecosystems and leverages emerging technologies like PolkaVM and JAM for decentralized computation and Metaverse integration.

The platform application is built with Swift, supporting PixarUSD, Hydra, and MaterialX libraries. The user interface caters to the roles of Creator, Project, and Collector, offering advanced features for creators and simple features for collectors.

The team consists of three founders and six advisors, bringing expertise in 3D generalist, software engineering, PixarUSD pipelines, strategic partnerships, legal complexities, technical knowledge, business direction, and research.

Afloat's short-term goal is to release the first version of the platform and network, build the community, secure partnerships, and launch the token for continuous development. The long-term aim is to transition into a DAO for 3D production and distribution in the Metaverse, with the community deciding the direction of Afloat.

The team has already brought PixarUSD into the Swift programming language, SwiftUSD, and developed afloat.app and afloat.network. They are actively raising funds for further development. All staking rewards will go towards the platform's development, eventually covering creators' publishing costs.

FRAX is a stablecoin that combines algorithmic and collateralized mechanisms to maintain its price target. It ranks 7th in market cap (2.7B) among stablecoins. FRAX has never deviated more than 1 cent from its peg since its launch 15 months ago.

FRAX is the largest Curve pool on Ethereum mainnet with nearly $3B in liquidity and is a top 10 token on Uniswap. It has been successfully lent out on Aave v2 for many months without any issues. FRAX is already deployed natively on Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche where Aave V3 operates.

In the Aave ecosystem, FRAX will serve as a borrowable stablecoin alternative to existing options. It has potential to increase Aave & FRAX volume while contributing to FRAX's stability. FRAX can also utilize its Lending AMO to mint protocol-controlled FRAX for lending on Aave markets.

FRAX is permissionless and is currently being used in deep liquidity pools across various stableswap+AMM protocols. It does not have a governance token emission schedule. There is a multisig for certain AMO contracts but it cannot alter user balances or protocol behavior. FRAX has undergone two thorough audits.

The document also addresses potential risks such as griefing attacks on CDP users and stETH price divergence. The authors believe that the risk of griefing attacks is mitigated due to the high cost of execution and limited impact on end-users. As for stETH price divergence, they suggest that it's less likely to occur during redemption activity because of buying pressure from liquidations or users reducing leverage.

The authors propose the following parameter recommendations:
- Redemption Fee Floor: 2.5%
- Redemption Fee Alpha (α): 0.05
- Redemption Fee Decay Factor (δ): 0.5

Title: BoLD Upgrade for Arbitrum One and Nova

### Technical Risks
- Potential issues preventing liveness of challenges due to smart contract bugs in new contracts.
- Safety risks where a malicious party can game the system and win due to logic errors in smart contracts.
- Logic bugs in assertion smart contracts affecting assertion confirmation and posting, potentially delaying withdrawals.
- Bugs in bonding logic in smart contracts that could lead to loss of funds.
- No change in bugs related to one step proof logic for Arbitrum chains.

### Timeline and Steps to Implement BoLD
1. Deployment of a public testnet with BoLD validators for 4 weeks.
2. Submission of the AIP as a forum post.
3. Audit of the protocol’s implementation by Trail of Bits.
4. Governance calls to discuss BoLD and this AIP.
5. Formal temperature check proposal to activate BoLD on Arbitrum’s Sepolia for 4 weeks via Snapshot vote.
6. Public audit program.
7. Finalize pre-mainnet requirements, including documentation, monitoring stack, and L1 gas costs reimbursement procedure.
8. Formal AIP submission to Tally.
9. If the formal on-chain proposal passes, BoLD will activate on Arbitrum One and Nova.

### Overall Cost
No cost for the ArbitrumDAO as Offchain Labs, Inc. will cover engineering and audit costs. Future development work for BoLD is expected to be undertaken by Offchain Labs, Inc.

### Disclaimer
Pending withdrawals when the proposed BoLD upgrade is activated will be delayed until the first BoLD assertion is confirmed. This means that all pending withdrawals initiated before the upgrade will be delayed by 1 challenge period, plus the time between the withdrawal was initiated and the time that the BoLD upgrade takes place.

Summary: The focus for the development of GHO over the next few months will be on maintaining a 1.00:1.00 peg with USD, reducing price volatility, increasing liquidity for DeFi integrations, growing non stable-coin paired liquidity pools, and targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases. The primary budget for these objectives is estimated at 500k GHO, excluding efforts beyond Ethereum. Key performance indicators include TVL DEX Liquidity Pools, TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools, DEX Liquidity Composition, Swap Price Impact, Annualised Peg Volatility, and Price level for > 90% time. The proposal suggests swapping 250k aUSDT and 250k aUSDC for GHO and creating an allowance for 500k GHO.

Keywords: GHO, DeFi integrations, liquidity pools, performance indicators, budget allocation, Swap Price Impact, Annualised Peg Volatility, TVL DEX Liquidity Pools, TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools, DEX Liquidity Composition.

Context: This proposal outlines the development strategy and budget allocation for GHO over the next few months. The primary objectives are to maintain a stable peg with USD, reduce price volatility, increase liquidity for DeFi integrations, grow non stable-coin paired liquidity pools, and support Borrow Cap increases. A high-level budget has been proposed, and key performance indicators have been identified to measure the success of these objectives. The proposal also suggests swapping certain assets for GHO and creating an allowance for a specific amount of GHO.

Implications: If this proposal is accepted, it will guide the development of GHO over the next few months, focusing on maintaining a stable peg with USD, reducing price volatility, increasing liquidity for DeFi integrations, growing non stable-coin paired liquidity pools, and supporting Borrow Cap increases. The success of these objectives will be measured using key performance indicators such as TVL DEX Liquidity Pools, TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools, DEX Liquidity Composition, Swap Price Impact, Annualised Peg Volatility, and Price level for > 90% time.

1. First, calculate the `liquidityPreStaking`, which is the total adjusted liquidity from applying all factors but with `stakingBoost = 1`. In this example, let's say the result was $200M.

2. Calculate the final desired liquidity by using the formula: `finalLiquidity = liquidityPreStaking / (1 - STAKERS_SHARE)`. For instance, if the share of stakers is 45000/145000, then the final liquidity would be $290M.

3. Apply a temporary `tempStakingBoost > 1` to `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs from non-shareholder LPs, resulting in a `tempLiquidity`. Let's say our result was $230M. This would mean the `tempStakingBoost` increased the adjusted liquidity in $30M, while what we actually want is an increase of $90M.

4. To get the desired `stakingBoost`, stretch or shrink the `tempStakingBoost` according to the ratio between the two liquidity adjustments (desired & temporary):

   ```(finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / (tempLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost```

5. In this example, the `stakingBoost` would be 3 times the `tempStakingBoost`.

6. Shareholder addresses associated with Balancer Labs (investors, advisors, and founders) will be excluded from liquidity staking to accelerate governance rights distribution. The list of these shareholder addresses can be found [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/liquidity-staking/src/users.ts).

Key aspects of DAOhaus governance include:
- Grants denominated in $HAUS to increase the relative stability of the $HAUS price.
- Utilizing $HAUS as a coordination mechanism within the DAOhaus ecosystem, beyond just voting.
- Supporting the utility and value of contributor compensation denominated in $HAUS.

The platform does not rely on external oracles, and the most used smart contracts are instances of the MolochV2.1 contract framework, which was audited by ConsenSys Diligence. The contracts used within the DAOhaus platform are not upgradable.

DAOhaus takes decentralization seriously, with none of its contracts being upgradable and governance power over key on-chain assets distributed across multiple entities. However, the largest centralization vector is front-end hosting, which a handful of developers have admin control over. The goal is to migrate the entire stack to decentralized infrastructure.

Fei Protocol, a core contributor at the stablecoin Fei v2, aims to manage volatility risk through Balancer v2 platform, potentially adding $913M+ of current PCV (Protocol Controlled Value) to Balancer.

The proposal suggests exchanging 200,000 BAL for an equivalent USD value of TRIBE and FEI from Fei DAO Treasury. The swap would diversify the treasuries into two assets: FEI, a stable asset, and TRIBE, offering governance rights and Protocol Controlled Value performance upside.

Benefits include treasury diversification, eligibility for Balancer to earn additional TRIBE through Fei's incentivized staking programs, adding stable assets to Balancer Treasury, distributing tokens to a long-term ecosystem partner, and granting governance power for DAO proposals.

The swap will use the 20 day smooth moving average price at the time voting ends, with the price feed being BAL/USDT (Binance) and TRIBE/FEI (Uni-V2) FEI/ETH (Uni-V2).

1. Off-chain Validator signature Authentication: Validators need a signature to validate preconfirmation requests. This will be achieved through various signing methods, such as the Commit Boost signing manager. Proposers, along with their key managers, will interact with a commit-boost’s signing manager and proxy key scheme to authorize respective validators and authenticate commitments.

2. Opt-in Procedure: Once registered, proposers must post some form of collateral to guarantee economic credibility behind their preconfirmations. The specific method for achieving this is yet to be determined.

Bolt is currently seeking validators for Cohort 1 for testing and demonstrating the protocol. Lido node operators are ideal partners for this purpose.

For on-chain registration, proposers would sign a message with their withdrawal address private key to request opting in. This message will contain the Ethereum address that the proposer intends to use as the signer for individual preconfirmation requests. The ownership of this new ECDSA key-pair is then proven on-chain through a transaction sent by the proposer.

Bolt places additional slashing risk on proposers, but ways to reduce this risk or increase rewards can be explored. Acceptance into the Lido alliance would be a direct endorsement for Chainbound and Bolt, leading to collaboration and feedback on Bolt’s design choices. Lido node operators are encouraged to participate in Validator Cohort 1 and provide ongoing assistance with validator adoption.

The proposal suggests updating the after burner function on the locked CAKE staking pool. Currently, when someone's CAKE lock expires and they fail to withdraw or re-lock within 7 days, their rewards start burning gradually over a few months until they reach zero. The update aims to introduce a bounty system where community members can claim a reward for moving expired CAKE from the locked pool to the flexi pool.

The bounty system works by allowing community members with at least 10,000 vCAKE to move the expired CAKE, claim a reward equal to 10% of the earned CAKE rewards, and send 10% of the earned CAKE rewards to the burn. The first person to claim the reward gets it.

The after burner will not start immediately after 7 days; instead, it will begin after the same time period as the coins were locked. For example, if coins were locked for 7 months, the after burner would start 7 months after the lock expires. This change aims to benefit forgetful stakers by returning their investment plus 80% of earned CAKE rewards and staking all their CAKE in the flexi pool for more CAKE rewards. The community member who moves the expired CAKE will pay a transaction fee, while the protocol benefits from 10% of the earned CAKE reward being burned.",bearish,2.191,2023-11-09 00:00:00+00:00,1.782,1.782,2023-11-09 00:00:00+00:00,-0.1866727521679597,2.125,-0.0301232314011866,verySmall

   The proposal aims to establish MOCA MONDAY Spaces to educate various communities about the ApecoinDAO, its processes, and upcoming AIPs. This initiative will foster a Cross-Community focused environment where different communities can learn from each other, particularly about the ApecoinDAO, participation, voting, and current AIPs.

   Key highlights include weekly discussions on all AIPs up for voting, live sessions with AIP authors and partners, promoting cross-community news, increasing ApecoinDAO, Ape Assembly, and Mocaverse DAO participation, and boosting knowledge about BAYC, Apecoin, Yugalabs, and their ecosystem.

   The budget will be allocated for community engagement, production enhancement, software, talent costs, and production consultation. The total requested fund is 76,830 USDC for a 12-month operation, including a 12-month reward vault.
