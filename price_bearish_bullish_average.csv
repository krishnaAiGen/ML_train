The Voltz Labs team recently submitted a proposal to request for an Additional Use Grant from Uniswap governance This would allow Voltz to use aspects of the Uniswap v3 code that is subject to the Business Source License

Voltz is a new DeFi primitive bringing interest rate swaps to DeFi in a manner that is up to 3000x more capital efficient than alternative models Voltz therefore is not a competitor to Uniswap but instead is complementary interest rate swaps are a core pillar of wellfunctioning financial systems  so as Voltz grows it should help DeFi grow which in turn should have second order benefits to Uniswap

That said the Voltz Labs team recognise the significant RD that went into v3 and as a result are offering Uniswap governance 1 of Voltz future tokens alongside a number of additional nonfinancial benefits The full proposal and discussion can be found here httpsgovuniswaporgtshoulduniswapprovidevoltzwithv3additionalusegrant15669usimonj

However the technicalities of the execution itself are something to be discussed If you check the unicode adoption website adopting a character can only be done via credit card This means funds we raise need to be converted to FIAT and only then a payment can be made

Approaches we discussed are

1 Someone we trust in the community creates an address and everyone in the community can donate to that address That person will then make a donation using credit card and they will be reimbursed with crypto assets we raise

2 Several members create a multisig and process is pretty much the same as 1

3 We utilize a PartyDAO httpswwwpartybidapp  where either individual or several members put up an NFT for sale If we reach a target and NFT is sold that funds can then be used in similar way as 1 and 2

 Nomic Labs the team behind Hardhat has become the Nomic Foundation a nonprofit organization dedicated to Ethereum Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world
 The Nomic Foundations work will be focused on Ethereums developer platform with the objective of achieving a worldclass developer experience and generally improving Ethereums public goods support structures
 Hardhathttpshardhatorg is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users Prominent teams relying on it include ENS Uniswap Optimism OpenZeppelin Aave Balancer Chainlink Synthetix and many more leading teams
 The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and most importantly build longterm infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem decreasing Ethereums dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components
 Seeking 30m in total funding from the ecosystem Donations of 15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation Vitalik Buterin Coinbase a16z The Graph Polygon Chainlink a16z and Kaszek Ventures
 Were proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of 5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission

 Ethereum developer experience

When it comes to Ethereum which is primarily a software development platform to build decentralized systems developer experience is a key strategic aspect for success Ecosystem growth requires more developers to build more software on top of Ethereum Developer adoption and learning speed core contributors to this growth are critically affected by developer experience

The rate at which the ecosystem innovates coming up with new creations and solving difficult problems both at the dapp layer and EVMSolidityVyper layer is also directly affected by developer productivity

Software development platforms arent new and playbooks established by the great developer experience success stories Rust Net TypeScript etc prove that achieving a quality developer experience requires a specialized approach paired with a longterm bigpicture strategy The potential impact in executing a dedicated effort for Ethereum would increase the ecosystems pace of innovation and growth building a powerful compounding effect over the long term for the entire industry

The inspiration for our vision came from our experience building Hardhat which allowed us to see how deeply challenging it is to build sophisticated Ethereum tooling These challenges must be alleviated to bring about organic ecosystemled improvement of developer experience that achieves worldclass quality

 Nomic Foundation

Nomic Labs has been fully dedicated to Ethereum developer experience since 2019 and were now pivotinghttpsmediumcomnomiclabsblogintroducingthenomicfoundationanethereumpublicgoodsorganization31012af67df9 to a nonprofit foundation formally dedicated to Ethereum Were aiming to build a longlasting organization that makes Ethereums public goods support structures stronger by contributing to the Ethereum Foundations existing efforts and reducing the ecosystems reliance on any one organization for development platform components

 Roadmap

Given the size and innovation pace of the ecosystem theres no way to foresee exactly what needs developers are going to have as things scale However we do know what engineering foundations the ecosystem will need in order to build its own solutions

Our overarching engineering strategy is to empower the ecosystem to build its own specialized tools This plan is based on four strategic pillars of the stack each of which offers an opportunity to leverage a platform to empower the ecosystem to keep building opensource infrastructure

For each of these pillars we will build a platform The four ecosystem pillars and platform opportunities weve identified are

1 Solidity
2 EVM tooling
3 Local development environment
4 Ethereum connector library

 The projects

 Slang  Rethnet

Over the long term these are our most important projects Targeting the Solidity and EVM tooling pillars Slang and Rethnet will serve as core infrastructure for the ecosystem to build new tools faster cheaper and better Were essentially building the tools that would have let us build Hardhat a lot faster We previously published a Medium posthttpsmediumcomnomiclabsblogslangrethnet2ad465fd7880 with highlevel descriptions of how both projects will complement each other

Slang

A Solidity compiler designed as a platform for tooling development an approach also known as compiler as a service Its top priority will be servicing tools through domainspecific APIs Much like Nets Roslyn it will feature a compilation pipeline made of distinct reusable components with standalone APIs A completely modular design guarantees that others can build on top of it by replacing the part of functionality they need to and reusing everything else

1 Parser that is only concerned with producing trees from code Usable on its own for example to create thirdparty formatters like Prettier plugins
2 Semantic analysis binding is concerned only with building a type system and validating the produced trees Usable on its own to implement thirdparty type checking securitythreat models and more advanced thirdparty linting
3 Code generation By replacing just this isolated part the compiler can compile for different targets eg nonEVM L2s
4 Language services These will receive an immutable representation of the above syntax trees bound trees codegen settings and will only be tasked with answering questions Usable on its own to expose in different IDEs same service for VSCode IntelliJ Vim etc Reusable to extend the functionality of other editor features task runners testing deployment CI debugging
5 Runtime observation APIs to support Rethnet

All of this will be reusable to create entirely new EVM programming languages since by replacing the parser and type system one can get an entire highquality toolchain working from the getgo

Rethnet

To provide a simulated environment where developers can build and test their Ethereum software tools need to replicate many of the components that make up a full Ethereum node implementation This is a significant engineering effort which given the complexity of Ethereum represents a barrier to entry to tooling development given the depth of knowledge that is required

Rethnet aims to make this easier by offering a native flexible extensible fast and languageagnostic EVM local development network distributed as a Rust library that is designed to be the underlying core in tools that provide debugging information to developers like Hardhat Foundry Remix Truffle DappTools etc It will be a Rust library made to be consumed from other languages like TypeScript Go Python etc as a native dependency It will implement the baseline of essential functionality every tool should have like Solidity consolelog stack traces and descriptive error messages as well as implement code coverage gas profiling and a step debugger At its core its an implementation of an Ethereum node with a layer of EVM runtime observation to provide development features

Building a new Hardhat Truffle Remix or DappTools using Rethnet will be a much more manageable project and Rethnet will be completely reusable for any EVM language through adapters

 Hardhat

Our flagship project targets the local development environment pillar and its currently at an advanced level of progress and adoption While Slang and Rethnet mature and catalyze organic growth in the tooling space developers still have needs to be met positioning Hardhat as our immediateterm solution to empower developers to keep decentralizing the world

Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment that developers use to compile deploy test and debug Ethereum software Most importantly its highly flexible extensible and designed to empower the community to build their own solutions This strategy has been successful and theres already a valuable ecosystem of reusable pluginshttpshardhatorgplugins

Hardhats roadmap is focused on becoming an extensible development environment with deep integrations across components in key areas of the tooling stack

 Hardhat VSCodehttpsmediumcomnomiclabsbloghardhatvscode9de29467fc26  programming editor
 Hardhat Ignitionhttpsmediumcomnomiclabsbloghardhatignition5a34a4e3d2de  contract deployment
 Hardhat Networkhttpshardhatorghardhatnetwork  local development network
 Hardhat Runnerhttpshardhatorggettingstartedoverview  buildtesting workflow

This roadmap leads to developers being well equipped to build powerful extensions to their workflow that increase their productivity according to their exact needs and to then share them with the ecosystem in the form of plugins

Hardhat will also eventually migrate to using Rethnet and Slang increasing its feature richness speed and stability while enabling dogfooding at scale for our brand new building blocks

 Web3js as a frontend platform

The OG Ethereum connector library Web3js is being revitalized into a highvalue project By focusing on community and ecosystem growth supported by an extensible architecture it can become a great source of value much like React represents in the frontend world but for dapps A website hub connecting community spaces support spaces educational resources extensions and related projects combined with an active ecodev effort workshops talks contests and incentives will create a source of leverage for the ecosystem This will provide better troubleshooting faster developer training more reusable code and most importantly the possibility of extending the library This effort is currently spearheaded by the ChainSafe team

 Funding

The Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem which is why were fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it

The Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with 8M alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin Coinbase Consensys The Graph Polygon Chainlink Gnosis a16z a_capital and Kaszek Ventures These donors make up 15M and were aiming to raise 15M more

 Why Uniswap

Generally we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum and weve approached and will continue approaching several protocols

Currently Uniswap is built using HardhathttpsgithubcomUniswapv3coreblobmainhardhatconfigts While this is a signal of Hardhats value the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap but for the entire ecosystem Well provide services to the Ethereum community that will

1 Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols Hardhat
2 Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem
3 Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making timetoproductivity shorter for new hires
4 Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built
5 Increase market volume driven by new users and new products

We believe this grows the market for everyone including Uniswap and wed love to have the Uniswap DAO contribute 5m in funding to this community effort",11.830087701494449
12," Summary

To date Uniswap has four deployments Ethereum Abritrum Optimism and Polygon In addition to these deployments there are proposals to deploy Uniswap on Harmony Celo and more chains expected soon The protocol should continue to deploy to new markets but as the protocol continues to grow it is vital the protocol learns to manage each of the deployments With each new chain there is new infrastructure that needs to be adapted to so that UNI on Ethereum can govern all of these deployments

GFX Labs has been researching the various deployments and has prepared the first Uniswap crosschain proposal to demonstrate how mainnet UNI can manage deployments on other chains

Polygon has a messaging mechanism between Ethereum and Polygon called the FxPortalhttpsdocspolygontechnologydocsdevelopl1l2communicationfxportal The portal functions via three contracts FxRoot State Sender  FxChild Messages can be sent from Ethereum to Polygon by calling the sendMessageToChildaddress bytes at the FxRoot contract on Ethereum which calls the State Sender contract The validatorshttpsdocspolygontechnologydocsvalidatepolygonbasicswhoisvalidator monitor the State Sender contract and relay messages to the FxChild on Polygon Upon successful relay to the FxChild the message is executed on Polygon by the validators

 What is Rage Trade

Rage Tradehttpsragetrade is a new perpetual swap  protocol built using Uniswap v3 Many onchain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs However traders and LPs benefit from v3s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp

 Why do we need an additional use grant

Our proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3s code but instead we have built on top of it Think of Uniswap as our matching engine and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswaps core leverage trading leverage LPing crossmargin liquidations and real time funding rates 

 What changes have we made that require additional use

We have built libraries to enable leverage trading leverage LPing and realtime funding rates Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswaps BUSL protect code that we require an additional grants use for

 SimulateSwaphttpsgithubcomRageTradecoreblobea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230contractslibrariesSimulateSwapsol This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage It makes use of Uniswaps TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries
 TickBitmapExtendedhttpsgithubcomRageTradecoreblobea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230contractslibrariesTickBitmapExtendedsol This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswaps TickBitmap required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract
 TickExtendedhttpsgithubcomRageTradecoreblobea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230contractslibrariesTickExtendedsol This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3
 LiquidityPositionhttpsgithubcomRageTradecoreblobea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230contractslibrariesLiquidityPositionsolL5 This library enables leverage liquidity providing and the accompanying margin logic It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so


  How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap

1 Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3 Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 not a fork all additional TVL  trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3

2 Rage Trade will spend significant RD resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 8020 strategy that composes with Curves tricrypto

3 Liquid  composable onchain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies Using perps Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging Additionally multicollateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market 

 Conclusion

Rage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswaps value as a protocol We look forward to discussing our proposal with the Uniswap community and answering questions in the comments below",13.781453117961243
14," Summary

This proposal is created on behalf of Blockchain at Michigan and in partnership with Proximity Labshttpswwwproximitydev We propose to deploy Uniswap v3 on Aurora through an additional grant license and ask the Uniswap community to consider and discuss this proposal

Uniswap will expand access to decentralized and permissionless trading of tokens on Aurora and aligns with the communitys multichain vision to bring trustless liquidity to all chains and position itself as a de facto DeFi hub in the space

Our proposal will include a 5m amount allocated for financial incentives to Uniswap users on Aurora and a commitment to actively engage with the Uniswap community to further support its growth through grant programs and funding for protocolrelated development

Proximity Labs will coordinate with the community and governance participants to distribute these funds and will support future developments and allocations to projects leveraging Uniswap and DeFis ecosystem participants on Aurora

 About Aurora

Aurora httpauroradevis an EVMcompatible execution environment running on top of NEARhttpnearorg a proofofstake layer 1 chain and takes advantage of its unique features including sharding and developer gas fee remuneration Our longterm vision is to provide a userfriendly platform for developers and users to build fast and highlyscalable decentralized applications offering seamless integrations with NEARs native chain as well as different L1s and L2 networks

Transaction costs on Aurora are among the lowest while ensuring a high throughput scalability and security Auroras SputnikVM is a highly optimized EVM that can execute transactions at high speeds while maintaining full compatibility with Ethereums VM This makes Aurora the perfect platform for applications that require high transaction throughput without incurring high costs

There are a total of 100 active NEAR nodes acting as Aurora Relayers The transaction finality happens on NEAR when a new block is minted right after its wrapped in a NEAR transaction and broadcasted to the nodes through one of the relayers Since the launch of Aurora in May 2021 the average block time has hovered around 1 second the chain boosts almost instant transaction finality at 2 secs and a nearzero transaction cost of 002 on average per tx

 Proposal

The Aurora ecosystem has been growing tremendously with very talented builders and founders joining our sides and leveraging Auroras exceptional low fees and fastfinality transactions New integrations and exciting announcements from major protocols and DeFi players such as Curve Lido have made Aurora one of the fastest growing chains out in the space with an evergrowing number of new people joining and interacting with our dApps Our network consists of a wide array of platforms from decentralized exchanges lending protocols and crosschain bridges Our flagship protocols include Bastion Protocol a lending protocol with more than 340M worth of assets deposited Trisolaris a decentralized exchange which secures more than 230M in liquidity and the Rainbow Bridge with over 900M in volumehttpsappuniwhalesionearbridgetracker bridged across NEAR Aurora and Ethereum

Auroras TVLhttpsdefillamacomchainAurora sits at 500M with highs at around 264B demonstrating an overall increasing engagement with our ecosystem and a tremendously growing base of native supporters There are more than 25 mil unique addresses with around 200k new unique addresses per day and we count around 200k transactions daily

 Uniswap on Aurora

Aurora has a long history of supporting crosschain protocol deployment and has been eagerly assisting developers and founders all across various chains and spaces to expand and reach new communities and tap into new ecosystems

Major DeFi protocols such as The Graph Flux Protocol and Gnosis have already deployed on Aurora and other blue chips such as Chainlink and Curve have committed to launching soon Were aware Uniswap has deployed on major chains such as Polygon Arbitrum Optimism and Celo with successful proposals to deploy on Moonbeam and Gnosis Chain Deploying Uniswap would be the next big step to take to add to the alreadygrowing DeFi hub on Aurora and will undoubtedly position itself as a premier AMM and a major liquidity hub for Near offering a seamless trading experience and allowing defi users to take advantage of its concentrated liquidity mechanism

This opportunity will allow Uniswap to gain more exposure within the NEAR community as it positions itself as a primary decentralized exchange hub as were headed towards a multichain economy and will undoubtedly bring a massive stream of revenue for Liquidity Providers

 Incentives

Our proposal comes with financial and nonfinancial incentives to promote longterm protocol development developer activity and innovation

We plan on offering 5m from our ecosystem growth fund to the Uniswap community in the form of Liquidity Mining incentives and Developer Grants to support DeFi applications leveraging Uniswap on Aurora and building on top of it

 Commit up to 25M for a liquidity mining campaign targeting the top liquid pairs to support the overall adoption of Uniswap V3
 Allocate a 25M fund to support longterm protocol development by funding developers designers and community members building on top of Uniswap and driving Auroras growth
 Promote and increase Uniswaps visibility within our ecosystem and to new projects as well as showcase in Auroras marketing campaigns and NearAurora hacker houses and hackathons

 Rainbow Bridge

Rainbow Bridge is the official decentralized bridge for transferring tokens between Ethereum NEAR and the Aurora networks At a high level Rainbow Bridge works through

1 LiteNodes a lightweight node implemented as a smart contract that stores block headers One deployed on the Ethereum network which stores NEAR block headers and one deployed on NEAR which stores Ethereum block headers
2 Relayers scripts running on virtual servers that periodically read blocks from one blockchain and communicate them to the LiteNode running on the other
3 Connectors smart contracts responsible for all of the logic associated with the crosschain management of a given asset type

Proximity Labs and Aurora will build a connector following the community vote to make the bridge compatible with general messaging functionality This connector will be deployed on both Ethereum and Near and will be responsible for transferring governance votesmessages between both chains One of the advantages of Rainbow Bridge is its malleability Any asset or data can be transferred across the Rainbow Bridge if relevant Connectors exist

 Bridge Security

 Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing
   Yes once the relevant connector will be deployed
 Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity by a multisig or a protocolset of incentivized nodes
   The bridge is secured by multisig Security is provided by implementing lightclients of both networks on the counterpart network Ethereum light client on NEAR and NEAR light client on Ethereum
 Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain eg Ethereum L1 or destination chain or is the security provided by another thirdparty entity

15," Proposal Summary

Following Uniswaps successful deployment on the Scroll testnet the Scroll team is proposing that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scrolls upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official deployment

Point of Contact  Lea Schmitt Email leascrollio

 Overview of our Proposal

We propose that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scrolls upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official canonical deployment Uniswap V3 has already been deployed to Scrolls testnet and the Uniswap router has processed over 18M transactions there

 Scroll is a bytecode equivalent zkrollup a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum
 Scroll is an opensource project developed in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation Privacy and Scaling Explorations organization It was built with the community for the community
 Our community ethos and vision are aligned with Ethereum We are committed to a secure decentralized censorshipresistant and efficient future that Ethereum offers through our plans to decentralize Scroll sequencers and provers

We propose that Uniswap will showcase this by integrating Scroll into its user interface

 Motivation

Uniswap being deployed on multiple Ethereum L2s is integral for encouraging competition and diversity of technical solutions to scale Ethereum We believe that Uniswaps community and the ecosystem that Scroll strives for are closely aligned Both projects are building trustless decentralized and secure financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone regardless of merit or location Deploying to Scroll offers many benefits including significant user savings an expanded user base capturing the zkEVM market and fostering L2 native innovation

 This deployment positions Uniswap as an early mover and captures a rapidly growing market as the Ethereum ecosystem gradually shifts to zkEVMs

 Uniswap on Scroll will integrate closely with Scrolls rapidly growing ecosystem Dozens of projects have committed to deploying on our mainnet and many are deployed on our testnet AAVE Lens the Graph Covalent Safe and Etherscan to name a few Given the excitement around Scroll and current usage of our testnet we expect hundreds of projects to deploy on our mainnet postlaunch

 Importantly Uniswap on Scroll will propel L2 DEX innovation We are on the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum L1 Scroll will bring new developers and ecosystem integrations to Uniswap

 Success Criteria

Deployment of Uniswap on Scroll will
 Increase Uniswap TVL targeting 100M within two months of deployment Grow  Uniswap order volume
 Enable listing of new assets on Uniswap that are unique to Scroll

Moreover Scroll will bring its dedicated and expanding developer community to Uniswap thereby boosting the growth of Uniswaps developer community

The best way to measure success for Uniswap on Scroll is to focus on TVL and transaction volumes We think that Scroll can deliver an additional 100M of TVL to Uniswap within two months of launch

 Protocol Security

ZKRollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum it relies exclusively on cryptography rather than unreliable cryptoeconomics

Scroll has a trustless Layer 1  Layer 2 canonical bridge which supports arbitrary message delivery The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM which is much more secure than relayerbased bridges

Security is the first priority for us Scroll implements the EVM which is wellspecified and battletested Additionally we are working with two external auditing companies to audit our bridge code and we have an inhouse security team that continuously reviews our codebase 

We plan to launch with a timelock delay and a security council to control privileged functions and contract upgrades Finally shortly after launch we will introduce distributed sequencer operators

 Deployment

After the Temperature Check we will move forward with deploying Uniswap V3 on our Scroll mainnet following which we will submit the Governance Proposal with the addition of the deployed contract addresses Since we are fully compatible with EVM it is effortless to deploy on Scroll We expect the full deployment will take a few hours

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the following Uniswap v3 contracts to be filled in after deployment to be deemed as the canonical Uniswap deployment on Scroll This deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance The text record of the uniswapeth ENS subdomain titled v3deploymentsuniswapeth will be amended to reference the Uniswap v3 Factory contract on Scroll following the process outlined here PostBSL Crosschain Deployment Process  New Uniswapeth Subdomainhttpsgovuniswaporgtrfcpostbslcrosschaindeploymentprocessnewuniswapethsubdomain20878

16,"Summary

Despite being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols Uniswaps outstanding voting power does not necessarily translate into active governance participation In fact many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50 vote participation rate and some even as low as 10 or 0 While there have been previous campaigns httpsxcomUniswapFNDstatus1653077861706739714s20 to encourage delegation by large UNI holders we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated if at all

In healthy governance environments proactive delegates wield significant voting power ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met

Therefore this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate 25 million UNI to each of 4 active yet underrepresented delegates selected based on the criteria outlined below To ensure further accountability each delegate must maintain a 80 participation rate at a minimum as explained further in Participation Requirements or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below In addition there will 1 year term so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned And if a received delegate is removed without fulling this 1 year term the role wont be filled

Despite numerous improvements to Uniswaps governance there are still several areas that require further improvement One prominent area is governance participation which has witnessed a downward trend compared to late 2022 and early 2023

Another issue is many large delegates are now inactive and the delegators who entrusted them with delegation are either unaware about this inactivity or simply do not care For example there is currently several delegates with more than 25 million UNI delegated who never even voted onchain according to Tally see the screenshot below

Therefore further distributing governance power to active but underrepresented delegates is a positive step forward ensuring governance is more active resilient and robust

Participation Requirements

 Must have voted on 80 or more of proposals minus the proposals that were canceled over the last 3 months as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot This includes both Snapshot and Onchain proposals such as Tally or Agora
 Must have actively participated in proposal voting for more than 3 months and have a Delegate Platform on Uniswap Forum under Delegation Pitch

Application Criteria

 Meets the above Participation Requirements
 Voting Power is less than 25 million UNI as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot

Next Steps

 Should this proposal pass on Snapshot a 5day period will begin where delegates that meet the above criterias are encouraged to post their application to be considered for delegation In cases where there are more than Four qualified applicants there will be an additional Snapshot vote to determine the top Four Once Four or fewer applicants are selected in case there are not enough delegates that meet the criteria it will proceed to an onchain vote

Other Clarification

The term will be 1 year from when 25 M UNI is delegated

Should the onchain vote be approved but there are three or fewer qualified applicants because there are not enough qualified applicants there WONT be a subsequent application period and Snapshot vote after the initial vote to fill the remaining available recipients

Should the onchain vote be approved and there are qualified applicants but one or more of them are disqualified in the future due to their low vote participation there will NOT be a new application and snapshot vote to give the opportunity to another delegate

As mentioned by in a previous proposal httpsgovuniswaporgtrfconboardingekuboincasacoredeveloperofuniswapprotocol2208520 seeking UNI delegation there will be deployment of at max four new Franchiser httpsgithubcomNoahZinsmeisterfranchiserblobmainspecmd contracts each one funded with 25M UNI 10M UNI total The owner of these Franchiser instances would be the Timelock while the at max four delegates chosen through the voting process outlined above can act as the delegatees",14.538001283052862
17,"Authors Uniswap Accountability Committee

 TLDR

 Today Uniswap governance via the timelock address has the ability to declare a new v3v2 deployment as officialcanonical
 The DAO has set a precedent for approving EVMbased deployments over the past 2 years
 This proposal seeks to give the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig agency over altering the v3deploymentsuniswapeth  v2deploymentsuniswapeth subdomains
 This will allow the Committee to edit these text records whenever a new v3v2 deployment is complete without having to go through an onchain vote
 To accommodate for this change we are also proposing an alteration to the current deployment governance process to increase efficiency
 The DAO will retain the right to assign incentive distributions from the treasury to these deployments via an onchain vote

 Our Proposal

We are proposing to enable the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig to alter the subdomains as soon as a deployments RFC passes the 7day discussion periodgiven there are no major points of contention during the RFC phase The RFC should give ample time to the DAO to make a decision regarding the deployment without having to partake in a 4 week governance ordeal And to make sure voters have a say in this process we are including a 5day challenge period that will be a part of the onboarding package temperature checkthis will allow voters to voice their dissenting opinion regarding a deployment 

Currently the Uniswap DAO more specifically the timelock address 0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC owns AND manages both subdomains This proposal would make the Accountability Committee the manager of the subdomains If at any time the DAO would like to alter the manager again or regain control this can be done via an onchain vote since the timelock still owns the subdomains

 New Proposed Deployment Process

Step 1

 If a chain wants to deploy Uniswap they typically connect with either the Foundation the Accountability Committee a delegate or any adjacent party
 Anyone is able to author an RFC whether it be a delegate the destination chain themselves or whoever else That RFC is posted on the forum for a minimum of seven days to allow a discussion to transpire
 The deployer can either have the contracts deployed at this point or notif the deployment is complete then include the contracts in the RFC
 If no issues arise in the RFC then the deployment will be viewed as approved and a 5day challenge period will be rolled into the onboarding package snapshot vote

Step 21 Work for the Deployer and Accountability Committee

 If deployment hasnt already been completed then it must be done after the RFC phase
 As soon as contracts are deployed and verified ensuring that the bytecode of the deployed contracts matches the bytecode of the mainnet contracts the Accountability Committee has the authority to write the relevant text to the subdomain
 The Committee will comment on the RFC confirming that the contracts have been verified and that the subdomain has been properly updated

Step 22 Work for the DAO and Accountability Committee

 The Committee will hold a temperature check to see if theres interest in deploying incentives on the new forkthis vote also acts as the challenge period
 If passed an onchain vote will take place sending the selected amount of capital to the Committee multisig for distribution

Both Step 21  22 can take place concurrently

 Technical Implementation

The onchain proposal needs to include the function calls below to grant the Accountability Committee write permissions to the subdomains The DAO will maintain ownership of the primary domain uniswapeth and thus have the ability to revoke permission through a governance vote

18,"This proposal is a continuation of the topic from VIP51 Previously several VRT Swap  XVS Vesting architecture designs were proposed that differed from the original design summarized in the Venus Tokenomics 2 published in August of 2021 One of these alternative designs referred to as fixed speed vesting proposed a vesting schedule that would have allowed all XVS to vest very quickly if VRT was separated into a multitude of accounts and deposited separately This potential workaround required a countermeasure in the form of a global daily limit on all deposits Many in the community pointed out concerns regarding this daily limit from a technical and user experience perspective

We considered feedback regarding the daily limit and how this unfairly allows those with bots to consume the daily quota before everyone else each day There is no technically feasible way to prevent this issue with the fixed speed model so we are proposing deployment of the original swap  vesting design

22,"Summary

It has been approximately one year since the last revision to Venus Tokenomics and given the continuing evolution of the market its time to reevaluate an optimal distribution of income given the protocols current and future needs

This proposal seeks to address the unequal distribution of income between rewards and treasury reserves It lays out a comprehensive plan to optimize the income distribution in order to better cater to the protocols needs and safeguard its sustainability

The key highlights of the proposed changes are as follows

Redistribute protocol reserve revenue allocation to
40 Risk Fund
40 Treasury Reserve
10 XVS Vault Rewards Buyback
10 Venus Prime Token Program

Redistribute liquidation and other product development distribution to
50 Risk Fund
40 Treasury Reserves
10 XVS Vault Rewards Buyback

Make use of the savings from the two rounds of 50 XVS emissions reduction to double the XVS vault legacy rewards currently set at 525 XVSDay to 1050 XVSDay with the aim of maintaining or even enhancing the vault rewards

Adjust the Venus Prime program Soulbound Token rewards Initial rewards for this program have been 20 of accumulated product revenues since Q4 2022 These rewards currently exceed 750K which are expected to significantly increase the APYs for eligible participants 

We propose to reduce the programs revenue allocation to 10 to balance rewards while preserving attractive APYs and incentivizing user participation

The expected outcomes are an increase in treasury reserves sustainable reward emission rates sustainable Venus Prime SBT reward incentives and maintenance of an attractive APR to reward XVS Vault stakers

Methodology of Analysis

To bring forth these recommendations the proposal has assessed the existing tokenomics of the Venus Protocol considered the past changes and their impact on the ecosystem and analyzed the market dynamics and trends

This change is possible if we consider the savings from the protocols October and February 50 XVS emission reduction which accounted for an estimated amount of more than 27M With this we propose reallocating these savings towards XVS vault stakers enhancing rewards without compromising on the token emission rate

Results and Conclusions

The proposed revisions in Venus Protocol Tokenomics are expected to yield positive results for the Venus ecosystem ensuring a fairer distribution of income and enhancing the platforms sustainability

    Stop the rewards on bCVX and stop counting it as a nonnative asset in the Boost calc

   The plan is to transition from incentivized liquidity on Uniswap V2 to Treasury Controlled Liquidity on Uniswap V3 and stop the rewards on Uni V2 pool
   Another suggestion is to halt the rewards on bBadger as they became redundant with the Boost powerup implementation
 Up to 100000 Badger is reserved for adding new Setts to the schedule with the Badger Council approval

40,"The proposal is to switch Badger rewards from Boosted to Prorata on the Badger Locked CVX Sett with the open launch this week and stop counting the blCVX deposits as the nonnative balance in the Boost calculation

This would mean that all depositors would be receiving the same APR in both Badger and cvxCRV emissions that are allocated to the Sett

With blCVX not being counted as nonnative balance Sett depositors would still be able to utilize their Boost power on other nonnative Setts while getting the Badger  bcvxCRV bonus from being in blCVX 
And it would also make the Sett more attractive for users with smaller Stake Ratios and to new depositors all while ensuring that the DAO gets as much CVX voting power as possible to vote on Bitcoin pools rewards on CurveConvex

To produce 12 independent animations with a run time of 1 minute each

This proposal introduces an ecosystemwide casting call to all eligible IP Holders powered by ApeCoin The animators of Atrium have experience with Disney Pixar HBO Netflix  more and await the opportunity to cocreate with community members Funding this proposal showcases ApeCoins dedication to providing new avenues for creators and results in 12 animations under a Legend of ApeCoin theme

Rationale of Value Added to ApeCoin

 In an increasingly digital landscape content rules permanence and brand recall Good brands build timeless content that fans can anchor on That in turn creates an increasingly valuable ecosystem around it As the canon storylines are created officially by Yuga this proposal to the ApeCoin DAO community has a unique opportunity to cocreate equally memorable characters and storylines that are completely driven bottomsup
 Being crypto native and having highly experienced talent from the animation industry Pixar Sony Netflix Dreamworks Marvel Atrium is uniquely positioned to work with ApeCoin DAO to create content that appeals to mainstream audience bring more awareness to an already lovable cryptonative brand and deliver cocreated cinematic content

How does this benefit DAO  DAO members

 ApeCoin DAO produces the storylines the community creates involving the ApeCoin brand
 Cocreate with crypto native network of qualified animators and filmmakers
 Reinforces top of mind for communityproduced content on all social channels Atriums previously created content has recorded millions of impressions and hundreds of thousands of views in aggregate
 Crypto native distribution mechanism of artifacts used in the production content viewing companion mints all made available free to the community members

Based on the overall reception of the pilot shortfilm series if community wants to expand on any specific storyline  Atrium will have logistics In place to build out the series with followup proposal

What is Atrium

Atrium is a blockchainbacked network of artists and creators Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting Animation Concept Art Voice Actors and Music production

Securing topquality creative talent who are well versed in the NFT space and committed to supporting the longterm growth of an ecosystem is extraordinarily difficult Here at Atrium we have curated and nurtured a collective of outstanding animators illustrators storytellers and allaround remarkable creativesTake a look at a few of our creators below

 Stateoftheart AR technology is cost prohibitive for most independent artists  creatives Since 2019 my company has been powering appless AR experiences for brands solving frictionladen user experience problems Therefore this proposal would fund the ability to empower accepted applicants with our already built zerocode zerodownload AR software used by brands from Paramount Pictures to Compass Real Estate
 Along with this technology we provide the advisory resources for the Launchpad participants to follow best practices  achieve success with their physicalmeetsdigital releases
 This proposal then empowers creatives  furthers the entrepreneurial ecosystem that is Web3 Each project that emerges from the ApeAR Launchpad
will produce an augmented product or experience with a requisite to incorporate APE as its exclusive currency

 Community Benefit 2 Augmented Utility for Collectors
 Through collecting NFTs I quickly realized that AR technology can even further solve key problems endemic to the Web3 ecosystem Specifically it can be leveraged to bridge multiple divides between physical and digital between story and product between online  IRL In aggregate this also solves the collectors greatest concern by offering cohesive comprehensive continual utility
 Both a connection to and extension of the jpeg itself our AR technology can take any still object location or image regardless of where it appears bringing it to life with motion and sound 2D  3D animations video audio rich text 360 portals Once static artworks become dynamic  lifelike with personality stories  journeys
 Even further all of the digital layers can be updated anytime over time realtime This presents the potential for utility or continuous value in perpetuity Augmented unfolding stories These stories can be strictly narrative practical like early access to NFT drops or a combination Content drops layered onto physical product drops

 Community Benefit 3 Onboarding New Web3 Participants
 An indirect consequence of bridging the physical  digital divide with AR may eventually become its most important Web3 legacy bridging the world of NFT early adopters  the rest of the world
 Products like motion graphic tees  experiences like interactive murals expose new audiences to the digital art we experience daily in Web3 But instead of leading with the technicalities of NFTs  blockchain we lead with the visual stories  what the tokens represent  as digital layers to our physical realities Newcomers get immersed in the intrinsic value of art before the financial value of art Actual appreciation before financial appreciation True authentic sustainable onboarding
 Then given our layered approach to AR newcomers can be presented with options to collect the motion art at the point of experience via available frictionless NFT solutions
 This expansive  inclusive worldview results in expanding the Web3 ecosystem to include new interested  eventually active participants

 Community Benefit 4 ApeCoin Commerce
 APE will be the exclusive payment method for all of the ApeAR Launchpad collections All of the resulting products will also include a Powered by ApeCoin logo
 Through this physicalmeetsdigital new use case ApeAR will generate new demand for APE This benefits the entire community serving the vision of ApeCoin as the currency of choice for creative capital in Web3 A flywheel effect takes place when ApeAR Launchpad projects successfully go to market  generate even greater interest for ApeCoin DAO

Ape Express aims to launch the ultimate toolkit for a thriving memecoin ecosystem on ApeChain empowering users with the tools they need to create customize and deploy tokens on ApeChain

With Ape Express no technical skills are needed for safe unruggable launches Configure and deploy your token with multiple features in seconds

Streamlined liquidity management borrow deploy and lock liquidity effortlessly Developers can deploy an LP using borrowed capital and launch a coin with a starting market cap of 15K while spending only 300 out of pocket 
Liquidity loans can be automatically repaid from token taxes liquidity or manual payment

In one place users can create their brand identity deploy tokens manage liquidity build and engage their community Think Pumpfun on ApeChain but way better and less trash For instance on Pumpfun tokens start with 1K MC and never have a chance to reach a DEX With our system every launch makes it to the DEX of choice and encourages a free open market on ApeChain

Token creators will have an option and be encouraged to airdrop portion of their supply to the holders of the blue chip collections of Yuga ecosystem BAYCMAYCBAKC CryptoPunks Kodas Moonbirds and Mocaverse holders

This will bring benefit to the holders of these collections and at the same time give the upcoming projects an opportunity to reach the high quality user bases that are the lifeblood of these collections

All of these processes are streamlined in the dapp so that anyone can do it with a few clicks of a button

This project aims to expand the ApeCoin ecosystem increase token velocity TVL and offer new opportunities for the builders in the ApeChain ecosystem

None of the funds requested in this proposal will be spent on development or team salary This proposal aims to bootstrap platform liquidity and the Ape Express marketing budget


 BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

2 Onboarding memecoin degens from other chains and converting this liquidity into APE
3 Boosting APE liquidity pairs Ape Express encourages users to pair their tokens with APE by automatically converting ETH USDT and other assets used on the platform into APE By locking APE in LPs we contribute to the overall TVL of the ApeChain
4 Amplifying onchain activity by facilitating fast and easy token creation and trading of memecoins we drive overall transactions volume Memecoin trading volume on Solana accounts for 12B daily and over 120M in volume on Base chain We drive transaction volume to the ApeChain native DEX
5 Enhancing APE token velocity gas fees liquidity loans and buybacks will all utilize APE
6 Backed by The Crypto is a Fun marketing engine The apes you see above are some of the most prolific memecoin degens in web3 We have our fingers on the pulse of the space and can push our audience over to ApeChain We run the 1 daily memecoin spaces on CT best believe we will promote ApeChain and Ape Express to the masses

9 Degen Analytic bots

PLATFORMS  TECHNOLOGIES
 Smart contracts for deploying tokens
 Smart contracts for lending liquidity  liquidity locker builtin
 Smart contracts and mechanisms for clawing back lent out liquidity

We have created our own set of contracts which interact with each other giving as much fluidity and flexibility to the system as possible Users simply pay for token minting which is dependent on how many features they are including in the token This acts as initial revenue for the product to safeguard minor expenses with regard to the deploying coststhe users token and other related contracts per product deployed and liquidity rounding errors from the lending activities

There are several ways for users to repay the loans
 Direct payment borrow 10000 APE in liquidity repay a direct 12500 APE to receive ownership of LP tokens albeit locked until the lock period is over
 Tax Tokens borrow 10000 APE in liquidity and passively repay 12500 APE as taxes are generated from the trading activity of the token All taxes are diverted to repaying the loan until completed The creator will then receive ownership of the LP and release it to their creators address when the lock period is over
 Liquidity Threshold borrow 10000 APE in liquidity and as the liquidity pool grows from net buying activity a loan with interest is repaid via clawback This means the user can select a 2x with a 25 interest to repay 12500 APE when the liquidity pool contains at least 20000 APE This approach is generally regarded to be safest when a higher threshold is selected as high as 5x is available This process is an automated repayment method

Another product is the liquidity locker All created tokens are automatically opted into this feature with a minimum of 30 days which begins when the loan is repaid in full Tokens created outside the platform can also use this feature given they make a small payment in APE tokens The lock period ranges from 30 days 3 months 6 months and 1 year

Finally Ape Express will be equipped with a mass sender contract and UI This is for any creator wanting to do an airdrop or presale distribution manually

Ape Express GTM strategy will include a referraldiscount coupon program initially to be issued by team members In addition APE stakers 10k tokens staked and up will be able to generate their own referral and discount codes customizable up to 20 referraldiscount mix

An incentive program will also be put into action if approved for a grant The tokens with the most activity measured by volume and holders will be awarded APE tokens every week for the tokens creatortreasury These metrics are reset every week to further incentivize only currently active projects or new projects to receive such rewards

Although we cant stop people from creating NSFW tickers on a permissionless blockchain we will have measures on our backend to hide any racist hateful or pornographic material from our leaderboards We can control what is represented on our platform and we will carefully monitor this to make sure we are in line with Apecoin guidelines

This proposal aims to promote Apes Mutants and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z  The Happy Ape an official MBA 00349 is a premium brand that aims to foster a culture of kindness compassion and positive mental health in our future generations This AIP would directly fund the creation of The Happy Ape childrens book and plush nfc tags and dapp development on ApeChain creating a unique digiphysical web3 experience for both kids and adults I believe in the future of ApeCoin and am proudly offering a 20 gross revenue back to the dao based on the initial products sold With the development of AIP378 I will use ApeChain and Ape to create innovative solutions and integrate them into the products Bored Labs LLC will take on the majority of work that is required reducing costs needed from the dao and includes but is not limited to ecommerce site creation thehappyapeiothehappyapeio add Ape as an accepted payment for our products develop the majority of ApeChain dapp work and nfc configuration All development will be open source and will be fully audited ideally by boring security dao or in cooperation with Horizen Labs edited

What makes any of this special Our childrens book will be one of the very first web3 books that can not only teach children and parents about the power of the blockchain but also onboard them as well using ApeChain The book is fully written and authored by myself Here is a quick summary of the book below or skip it for the juicy tech

The Happy Ape and his friend journey on a daily adventure gathering bananas amidst the vibrant jungle Their routine centers around a central tree housing a precious book where their banana counts are meticulously tallied and stored When theft of the only book shatters their dreams The Happy Ape crafts a magical book uniting the jungles apes in trust With every ape receiving a copy of the newfound magical book no one could lie steal or cheat because all books have to agree All of the apes lives changed for the better The Happy Ape and his friend finally could purchase the coveted bouncy ball playing happily ever after together

Such an amazing story isnt it how can it get any better I plan on integrating an nfc tag into every book Thus delivering a digiphysical experience allowing the user to scan the tag with a compatible mobile device and instantly mint a digital version of their book This will be a seamless cost free user interaction all powered by our ApeChain kudos Horizen Labs In order to do all of this I plan on partnering with IYK a premier supplier of nfc tags in the web3 space Their mobile app will allow easy access to our digiphysical experience This requires the development of smart contracts and a dapp on ApeChain The development will be achieved through Bored Labs LLC and will be open source I believe that open source development leads to better community adoption security and transparency I have many plans for the evolution of our digiphysical experience as well IYK allows for OTA updates easy updates to modules introducing the user to new features like unique stories animations and more In addition to this experience I will also have an ecommerce site with the ability to purchase the products with Ape

To ensure an unforgettable and joyful experience I have designed with meticulous attention to detail a special Happy Ape plush ensuring they become cherished friends for all This plush will be approximately 15 in length and 6 wide Many plushies are small and not even comfy Our design ensures a warm soft and comfy embrace The Happy Ape is sure to be a loving companion for so many around the world

Let me start off by introducing myself My name is Kevin Im 37 and Im married with 3 kids 8 yo girl 6 yo boy 2 yo girl Im a software architect and Ive been in the web3 space for a few years I have run a successful software company Bored Labs LLC for 3 years now I have bookshelves full of childrens books and bags full of plushies The amount of time Ive spent reading to my kids and playing with plushies is measured in years I believe in the power of community and helping others which is why I am here My passion to share kindness and love back into the world while helping others is what motivates me to do this I want to provide value back to the various communities connected to apecoin and help them grow as well I hope that through future collaborations I can work with other communities like bulls on the block and mocaverse to continue creating positive and inspirational childrens books along with animated videos I believe this is a small stepping stone that will lead to a much larger goal of combining web3 ip use to bring people together

I added a budget for marketing that will help ensure reach and the success of my brand Half of the marketing budget will be given back to the buyers of my products A simple marketing strategy ill rely on will be asking product buyers to post images of themselves with my products and reward them with APE The other half will be reserved for various marketing efforts as needed


 BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
 Most importantly ApeCoin DAO will be supporting and empowering our future generations through a unique onboarding digiphysical experience that will help amplify innovative solutions on ApeChain This AIP will help promote the use and growth of ApeChain and APE by building one of the first dapps that will help onboard many new users and introduce them to ApeCoin The Happy Ape products aim to give more visibility to the ApeCoin community in a positive light We will also be reaching a new audience that we havent explored much of Our products support kindness compassion and positive mental health which is something we could all use more of

Were offering 20 gross revenue back to the DAO to show gratitude and continued support back to the community Detailed under our Overall Cost

As a result of this proposal IYK has promised that they would add ApeChain as a supported chain to their application

This would allow anyone using IYK to use ApeChain as their selected chain to mint nfts on It would help guide the development and use of digiphysical experiences on ApeChain and directly fund code that is open source leading to better security and adoption starting within our community We need a better way for fast adoption of ApeCoin

I will ensure resources like artistsanimators are from the ApeCoin community With many more future books and animated videos I plan to collaborate with more ApeCoin communities I promise to innovate new ways of incorporating ApeChain and Ape into our future products as this is just a stepping stone for us Its important that we continue development around ApeChain and APE I would be honored to have ApeCoin DAO help us cultivate positivity into many lives of our next generation around the world

 PROPOSAL

The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security usability to protect APE holders and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP Any material deviations from an AIP as initially approved will be disclosed to the APE holder community",12.125171294343302
73," ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to promote Apes Mutants and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z consumers via extremely popular and influential social media personalities on Instagram Tik Tok and Youtuber The goal is to create awareness within the normies and introduce them to the Bored Ape Yacht Club as the best club in the world despite not having a club or any yachts and that ApeCoin is the future of finance that will lead to financial freedom despite not having any utility or real world use cases

By Achieving this goal we hope to increase demand for Apes and get hundreds or maybe even thousands of normies to come buy our bags If we can convince them into truly believing that Apes Mutants and ApeCoin are cool we hope they will buy them to be a part of this great community with no interest of ever selling for a profit resulting in an increased holder count This can potentially get Apes out of the hands of Blur farmers and traders who only buy Apes to flip them for a 001 eth profit or loss
MAGA  Make Apes Great Again

 BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Increased holder count This may or may not bring in a few thousand new ApeCoin bag holders
New community members and DAO participants We may or may not get a few thousand new plebs to complain about how down bad they are

More hate and ridicule We may get a bunch of people to make fun of and talk bad about Apes But theres no such thing as bad publicity right Whether the things they say are good or bad they will be talking about us

The idea is to convince the normies that Apes are cool and they need to be like us To make them realize that the Bored Ape Yacht Club is the best club in the world and they need to join this club asap before they can no longer afford to join

The only way to find out if it works is to FAFO The more we FA the more we FO If we dont FA well never FO

The one benefit I can guarantee for sure is that 1000 community members will get to claim a free Twisted Ape Treasure Chest I have 1000 of these Treasure Chests in stock and ready to ship They are currently priced at 69 APE but if this AIP is approved I will make them a free claim to the first 1000 wallets that vote on this AIP regardless whether they vote yes or no

We will also include delegated voters If you delegate your votes to another wallet or are part of a sub community that votes separately such as Surreal or Mocaverse our dev team will get all your wallet addresses from the snapshot and include you in the free claim

I will post the winners of these Chests here on the forum as well as on X and Discord I will ensure everyone finds out about it by making public announcements on as many Twitter spaces as I can get on We will not request any personal information directly however the claim will be made on our Shopify website with the standard checkout process similar to every other ecommerce store on Shopify So mailing addresses will be as safe as they usually are as with any other order users place online

If there are less than 1000 voters and delegates and we have some leftover Treasure Chests then we will make them available for free to all ApeCoin holders via a random raffle system

83,"Wise token has integrated with Binance Smart Chain Lets farm

Eight months ago Wise token successfully launched on Ethereum and currently boasts a 300 million Total Value Locked TVL and about 10000 users Now on BSC with a BEP20 version of Wise WISB tokens have the same innovative features as the original token on Ethereum as well as some important upgrades

Reduced Impermanent Loss  WISBBNB liquidity pairs have significantly reduced impermanent loss because the prices of WISB and BNB are correlated you can already see this concept in action on WISEETH LP on Uniswap and Quickswap This makes WISB the premier LP token to have on BSC

BNB Airdrops  Wallets staking WISB for 365 days or longer will receive weekly ongoing airdrops in BNB The revenue for this is generated from lending out the massive liquidity formed in the presale Currently the weekly airdrop pool is 30000 in BNB

In addition to regular staking and LP farming on Pancakeswap this proposal and other partner DEXs WISB tokens can be lent to the Reserve Pool which is a profits sharing pool where holders can earn a slice of the entire ecosystems profits This becomes especially interesting considering the profits generated by the system are bound to skyrocket once the LendingBorrowing contract is deployed later this year

WISB token is the ethical standard for all DeFi projects It is a fairly launched fairly distributed fully decentralized audited cryptobacked and highly liquid asset

Fairly launched  No parties received free tokens or discounted tokens not even the founderteam

Fairly distributed  Everyone paid fair market price to obtain WISB

Fully Decentralized  100 automated by smart contracts with no admin keys

Audited  By CoinFabrik  httpswisetokennetWise_Audit_ReportpdfhttpswisetokennetWise_Audit_Reportpdf  The WISE team also ran a 100 ETH bug bounty for the community to double check the code before launching

BNBbacked  100 value of the BNB raised in the presale goes straight into the Pancakeswap pair which is then locked forever by burning the LP tokens

Highly liquid  Massive liquidity allows investors to buy more without moving the price against themselves All successful markets need massive liquidity in order to reach a large market cap and this is part of the long term WISB strategy

WISB is one of the safest assets you can hold in the entire BSC ecosystem and also the only system that shares 100 of profits with its holders Wise token was designed to be the most efficient DeFi ecosystem ever made and we believe that focusing all profits back to users gives us a massive competitive advantage versus the traditional corporatestyle business models Wise token was created by the community and for the community and we invite you to become part of our amazing group

94," Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we arent removing rewards from the farm itself

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value

 Hopefully this example might be better

   Under performing farm  1x 10 CAKE
   High performing farm  1x 10 CAKE
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

   Under performing farm  0x 0 CAKE
   High performing farm  1x 20 CAKE
    

So with the above in mind were proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Poolfarm combos etc

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple average daily volume 14day volume unique token holders on BSC etc

110,PancakeSwap is probably the best DEX in the entire cryptospace however in order to keep growing it needs to attract more users The price of the token will only increase if the demand for it is greater the burning of tokens is not enough to increase the price so the demand for Cake must be increased For this we propose to extend the operation of PancakeSwap to multiple blockchains Polygon Polkadot Moonbeam or others maintaining the supply but sharing it between different chains,11.715741992442458
111,We propose to increase Pancakeswaps services by adding loans that can only be borrowed using CAKE as locked collateral This would increase the demand for CAKE and therefore its price,11.670872088675807

116,"I have been in Cake since the first week it was launched I invested when few people knew about it and considered it a joke Now Pancake swap is the 1 decentralized exchange based on users and volume The Pancake swap team deserves a huge amount of praise for their efforts for how they have evolved the platform But its time to evolve again

Pancake swap has done an incredible job of creating a deflationary token system It has redefined ICOs and made them safe for everyone Just a few years ago ICOs were riddled with scams as you had to send your crypto blindly to an address hoping you would get something back Now all you have to do is hold the Cake token Major projects like Coin 98 Trust Wallet Axie Infinity and hundreds more were given to Cake holders just for holding the token Now EVERY other Dex is trying to copy this model But the projects they give pale in comparison to what Pancake provides 

In an effort to reduce Cake inflation they have had to remove rewards for certain LPs This caused people to remove their liquidity Its important to note that Pancake did not remove these pools as some would suggest they just removed the CAKE rewards for them But there is a reward structure you receive for providing LP and many LPs pay great rewards in the provided tokens Few understand this Instead they say Pancake removed our pool There are some pools that pay over 100 in fees with no Cake rewards search for them 


That said the FUD of Cake removed our pool has resulted in less liquidity and as a result higher fees when swapping many tokens Its not about the fee that Pancake charges thats still one of the lowest in the industry rather its the PRICE IMPACT If there isnt enough liquidity you can pay over 5 in some cases But becuase the pool isnt incentivized enough people arent providing liquidity to reduce the price impact  You cant have an efficient exchange without people providing liquidity This is a problem for ALL decentralized exchanges Not just Pancake Swap

SOLUTION

1 Stop Cake emissions 

The Cake reward structure was devised at a time when no one knew how big DEFI would become Cake has grown bigger than anyone could have imagined The old Cake reward structure no longer works for the future There is however a fantastic deflationary mechanism in place Cake would continued to be burned by these mechanisms Cake would also still be used in IFOs and governance and voting You also MUST own a minimum amount of Cake just for using the platform There are too many people using the platform that dont own Cake 

2 Create a New Reward Token

This token will be used to incentivize LPs longterm Rewards would never be removed from the LPs The only way you would receive this token is by having Cake The reward token could be incentivized in other ways The team knows how to create deflationary models to keep the price stable 

3 Replace many of the BNB LPs with Cake 

BNB has many deflationary mechanisms in place and no one can use BSC without BNB But again were giving away too much Cake to non Cake holders 

4 Increase the fees to providers 

017 to providers is not enough This needs to be at least 03 or higher This means the total fee needs to be at least 043 to continue to burn Cake at the same rate Although with NO inflation we dont need to burn Cake at the same rate If this seems high to youyoure wrong With stock brokerages it is typical to pay over 1 in fees for transactions Forex the lowest fee you pay on the most liquid pairs is 12
Even Coinbase charges almost 2 on exchanges They do this by manipulating their exchange price vs the real price 

In reality in most cases you are paying more than 043 because of the price impact If your price impact is 03 that means your TOTAL fee is 06 03 is a VERY LOW price impact but thats still higher than it should be If we all provide enough liquidity then we can get the price impact on ALL pairs to less than 01

The exchange then becomes more efficient Which is what we all want",10.853319427755698

150," Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we arent removing rewards from the farm itself

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value

 Hopefully this example might be better

   Under performing farm  1x 10 CAKE
   High performing farm  1x 10 CAKE
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

   Under performing farm  0x 0 CAKE
   High performing farm  1x 20 CAKE
    

So with the above in mind were proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Poolfarm combos etc

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple average daily volume 14day volume unique token holders on BNB Chain etc

I proposal it cost a small amount of cake that is then burned to create a proposal  I think by doing this only people who are serious with proposals will do this  And if you proposal or part of your proposal is adopted you get your cake back  Other wise cake is burned to make a proposal  This would also stop duplicate proposals that essentially say the same thing because it will be time stamped the first proposal

Cost to make a proposl a could be equal to 1 cake

164,"Pancake swap has just announced that more farms will have reduced rewards Those who understand PCS understand why this is being done To reduce CAKE emissions However over the past several months has only resulted in those projects getting less liquidityand ultimately fizzling out of defi 
This hurts PCS This hurts defi

A DEX needs liquidity More emphasis needs to be placed on this People dont understand that you make money even when there are NO Cake rewards And PCS does not educate people in that regard

However deincentivizing pools that have taken the time to be a part of the PCS ecosystem isnt the solution 

As Ive mentioned in a previous proposalthe only solution to keeping CAKE emissions as they are yet still incentivizing more liquidity and pools is to create a token specifically for farming One that is designed for the future The current CAKE tokenomics does not support more liquidity There is less than 05 of BTC on PCSwhich speaks to how much growth potential there isbut if the BTCBNB pool were to get 10X more liquidity the APR would be 09 at current prices Taking what little CAKE reards from smaller projects to keep supporting the main pool s does not support innovation and longterm growth 

Create a new token that requires you to
1 Hold a minimum amount of CAKE
2 Supports 10X liquidity growth while still giving compettive rewards
3 Support higher APR in ALL pools including the longterm pool

PCS is the best in the business at creating tokenmoics with burn mechanisms etc to prevent a dilution of the new token",26.368798526958454

 PancakeSwap and Token Supply

The state of DeFi and PancakeSwap has changed immensely since our inception in September 2020 and we propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750000000 750M to better reflect our longterm outlook on PancakeSwap and the CAKE token

 Current PancakeSwap Tokenomics

In the kitchen we have been working hard to bring value to PancakeSwap and the CAKE token from providing new products eg Perpetuals to sourcing the tastiest Syrup Pools and Farms Unique amongst AMMs we also burn transaction fees from platform activities eg trading prediction farm auctions to further increase the scarcity of the CAKE token

But we can do better and we will

 Proposed Cap on CAKE Maximum Token Supply

We propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M CAKE Based on our calculations  which can be found in detail in our litepaper v2httpsv2litepaperpancakeswapfinance  this comfortably gives us an approximate runway of 3 years before the current circulating supply reaches this cap 

We believe that implementing this proposed cap will enable the CAKE token to better reflect the value community and sustainability of PancakeSwap

 Whats next

If the community decides to approve the proposal to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M we will formally incorporate it into our tokenomics and institute the max token supply cap

179,"Main purpose of this proposal is to allow users to unlock the CAKE in emergency reduce the CAKE circulating and reduce the MAX CAKE supply in long term 

This will give users more confidence as they can unstake CAKE with penalty and they wont miss out opportunity to cash out if CAKE price increases

We should allow users to unlock CAKE before unlock date at penalty of 20 and 20 of penalty will be directly sent for burning and the amount is reduced from 750M max supply This will slowly reduce the max supply and circulating supply and allow users to unlock their CAKE in emergency

This will bring more users to staking and reduce the CAKE supply in long term



Example  

If I have 1000 cake in locked staking I can unlock CAKE any time and I will get 800 CAKE back and 200 CAKE will be sent to burn address and MAX CAKE supply will be reduced to

195,"The objective of this proposal is to share ideas on how we can do the following 

1 Increase rewards for farmers
2 Increase the utility of staked CAKE
3 Increase the protocol revenue 
4 Reduce CAKE emissions
5 Get closer to ultrasound money

Every few weeks we vote to change the rewards for each farm reducing some and increaing others  This method should be scraped and replaced with a ve type voting gauge 

Staked CAKE holders could then vote on how the CAKE rewards should be split between the farms 
If a farm get 5 of the vote then they get 5 of the CAKE rewards 

Once a vote deadline has been hit them reward amounts are locked in for 2 weeks and then votes are recounted every 2 weeks 

On top of the Gauge voting system we build a UI for bribes where farmers and 3rd party protocols can offer a payment to staked CAKE holders in exchange for their votes 

As the bribe UI builds up and the bribes start coming in we can start reducing the CAKE emissions being paid to the staked CAKE holders  Replacing CAKE emissions with income from other protocols 
The reduction of emissions to the staked CAKE pool should be at a slow and steady rate of 1 CAKE per block per month until the rewards are 0 CAKE emissions 

After the first reduction in emissions to the staked CAKE pool the protocol will redirect 5 of the trading fees from the 001 and 005 farms to rewarding the staked CAKE pool  

To kickstart the system the rewards to farmers should be increased by 025 CAKE per block per month over a 6 month time frame increasing the emissions by 15 CAKE per block  Once the ecosystem is up and running we can look at reducing these emissions 



The expected outcome

1 Emissions reduced by 075 CAKE per block a month with a total reduction of 515 CAKE per block after 7 months a 55 reduction in emissions 
2 Staked CAKE holders rewards switch from emissions to bribes  trading fees avoiding a massive overnight cut in rewards 
3 Farmers see an steady increase in the overall rewards allocated to farming 
4 3rd party protocols have the option to buy voting power with bribes which should increase the liquidity in their farms 
5 3rd party protocols now have a reason to buy and hold staked CAKE so they can vote for their own liquidity pools 
6 Staked CAKE voting power has an increased value",15.327641548861163

204," Upgrade of Galxes Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift Galxes Farm rewards from the current GALBNB v2 LP to the new GALBNB v3 LP

We believe that transitioning to the GALBNB v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the GAL token and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap As a result of the concentrated liquidity model the same amount of liquidity in v3 compared to v2 can support significantly larger trades

For example for a 500 trade with a liquidity of 200000 in the pool v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2 Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of  25 of the current GAL price

To ensure a smooth transition between v2 and v3 pairs there will be an overlap of one day where there will be incentives directed towards both farms This will occur on 5 May 2023 

After 0900 UTC on 5 May 2023 only the v3 pair will receive incentives so users are encouraged to migrate in advance of this time

 The New Farm

The proposed new Farm will have doubled emissions for the first 7 days For example if the v2 farm emits 10 CAKE per day the proposed v3 farm will emit 20 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 10 CAKE per day thereafter

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm 

Previous v2 Farm
 Stake GALBNB LP earn CAKE
 05x multiplier
 24 CAKE per day

New v3 Farm 025 fee tier
 Stake GALBNB LP earn CAKE
 12x multiplier 24x multiplier for the first 7 days
 48 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 24 CAKE per day thereafter 

In the future the farm will be readjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 12x multiplier farms average daily volume 14day volume unique token holders on BNB Chain and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users safety and security

 Key timelines

 Launch of GALBNB v3 farm Approx 0900 UTC on 5 May 2023
 Sunset of GALBNB v2 farm Approx 0900 UTC on 6 May 2023

 How to migrate

Please remember to shift your LP to the new farm before the v2 farm sunsets

The idea is reward with some progressive percentage to someone who holds CAKE and provide liquidity for pools or farm

Who holds CAKE gets rewarded with extra percentage on the profit of the liquidity pools

Here we add value and usage for the coin and a exponencial percentage to who make the liquidity and holds CAKE at same time

The increase of the demand will appear just in the beginning of this idea and forces market makers to holds the coin for more profit in the swap of the liquidity pools

As we continue to optimize CAKE rewards across all of our deployments we are able to gradually lower the overall CAKE emission while maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate a smooth trading experience Ultimately this enables us to contribute a greater amount of CAKE towards the weekly burn

Given the traction and overall market share shown on our BNB Chain v3 deployments this proposal aims to decrease emissions to the farms listed below and increase the overall CAKE burn by approximately 1700 CAKE per day

These optimizations will add up over the coming months to 1 improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across farms and 2 redirect CAKE rewards towards the highest growth farms ultimately accelerating the path towards ultrasound CAKE

 Adjustment Details

With the above in mind we are proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below Note all other BNB Chain v3 farms will continue to earn the same level of rewards and even with these adjustments the farms below will continue to have a healthy level of liquidity volume and APR

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their average daily volume 14day volume capital efficiency and alternatives available

  Token rewards per second  CAKE will depend on final CAKE amount


The CAKE tokens used to fund these Syrup Pools will be provided by PancakeSwap and APX Finance equally The final CAKE amount will depend on token prices at time of conversion

On PancakeSwaps side the CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions but rather will be taken from our Multichain Warchest allocation The yield from the Syrup Pool will encourage more users to participate in PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on opBNB increasing liquidity which will ultimately lead to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees

 Max Stake per Wallet

There will be no cap on how much CAKE a user can stake in the Syrup Pool This is to encourage as much onchain ALP liquidity as possible

 Performance of Perpetuals v2 on Arbitrum

Since the launch on 28 Aug 2023 PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on Arbitrum has achieved impressive results surpassing 1 billion in cumulative trading volume and attracting over 1000 users With the support of liquidity attracted through syrup pools our platform has consistently secured a prominent position among the leading derivatives protocols on Arbitrum in volume

Our previous Syrup Pool proposal successfully incentivized liquidity provision which is crucial for facilitating trading on the perpetuals platform We have currently attained more than 2 million in liquidity value of minted ALP tokens of which 15 million are staked in our Syrup Pool

During the period of incentivisation how much CAKE was spent on the ALP pool How much CAKE was burnt instead This will allow your community to understand the valueformoney

Our goal is to establish a dominant position in the derivatives category on opBNB This proposal seeks to kickstart liquidity provision in the ALP Pool to facilitate trading for the perpetuals platform on opBNB

 What is Perpetuals Trading

Disclaimer This information presented in this proposal does not constitute any form of financial advice or recommendation please do your own research before making any investment decisions

Perpetuals perpetual swaps or perps are a special type of futures contract without an expiration date

Futures trading allows users to enter positions on margin leverage using borrowed funds to optimize capital Using leverage allows a user to enter a position with a size that is larger than their account balance For example using 10x leverage a user could trade 100 CAKE for the price of 10 CAKE In this example the initial margin would be 10 CAKE which is used to collateralize the leveraged position

In PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 weve streamlined our interface by removing the order book and market depth displays Instead our partner APX Finance has introduced the ALP pool which now provides liquidity for all trading pairs maximizing your capital usage The ALP pool will actively participate in the marketmaking process for our V2 perpetual contracts

 What is ALP

From the team ALP is APX Finances liquidity provider token made up of a pool of assets USDC USDT DAI ETH BTC Users can become liquidity providers by using any of the specified assets to buy ALP ALP pool is the direct counterparty of V2 onchain perp traders

The initial issue price of ALP is USD1 The price of ALP is influenced by the profit or loss of the pool and income from trading fees funding fees and liquidations

In the future APX Finance plans to support more utility of ALP on the platform such as earning transaction fee rewards using ALP as margin for perpetuals trading and participation in DAO governance and voting

 Proposal to Launch veCAKE Gauges System on zkSync

As mentioned in our initial veCAKE proposalhttpspancakeswapfinancevotingproposal0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c we are launching veCAKE in phases and are excited to share the next deployment  zkSync

 Recap VoteEscrowed CAKE Overview

As a quick summary heres quick recap of veCAKE with the following utilities

1 Direct Gauge Emissions  veCAKE holders will be able to directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power which will be determined by veCAKE balance

2 Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation  external protocols such as veCAKE managers and bribe markets will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE rewards and receive voting incentives for doing so veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to automate their voting and potentially earn boosted rewards However direct participation is highly encouraged
 
 Inclusion of zkSync in veCAKE Gauges System

Currently the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain Ethereum and Arbitrum is 099 CAKEblock  

With the inclusion of zkSync the current Trading Allocation emission of 00131 CAKE per block directed towards zkSync Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions 

As part of the voting gauges design the Kitchen proposes to retain a 40 voting share of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs such as ETHUSDC on zkSync 



There are two key reasons
 To ensure a smooth transition for liquidity providers from farms managed by the Kitchen to farms which are managed by veCAKE voting without affecting their APRs significantly in the initial rollout
 To ensure that core liquidity pools continue to receive sufficient incentives so that liquidity depth and fee generation are not significantly affected This will ensure the continuity of CAKE burns from trading fees which drives deflationary CAKE tokenomics

In the initial rollout phase the Kitchen will distribute these votes based on the following principles
 Ensuring core liquidity pools are provided a competitive return on their LP positions
 Ensuring that existing Syrup Pool partner arrangements are met before migrating them fully to the veCAKE gauge voting system
 Ensuring that any of the smaller farms which did not receive any votes after the launch of veCAKE will receive at least some allocation in the initial rollout capped at their current emission levels

With the proposed vote allocation the Kitchen will distribute its share of votes at the end of each voting epoch after all voting participants have voted 

In other words the Kitchen will apply its voting share at maximum translating to 04 CAKEblock as far as needed to smoothen out any possible abrupt changes in the Farms while allowing veCAKE participants to get used to the gauge voting mechanism 

If the gauge voting results will not affect any core liquidity pools and trading volumes significantly the Kitchen will abstain from voting in that particular voting epoch or vote in alignment with existing votes

Over time the Kitchen aims to reduce the portion of CAKE emissions directly managed by the Kitchen as all veCAKE participants become familiar with the process

More information can be found in our docshttpsdocspancakeswapfinanceproductsvecakegaugesvotingfaq 

 Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE launched shortly on zkSync after this vote concludes",18.160880629179484
254,"This proposal has two principles to empower Ultrasound CAKE


1 Increase the MAX CAPS proposed weight gauges for the CAKE pool from 35 to 60


Pros  This will undoubtedly encourage more CAKE staking consequently strengthening the entire community and reducing selling pressure


2 Develop a new aggressive reduction plan around 50 of emissions to take place over the next 4 months


Pros  It is crucial to signal greater scarcity of CAKE to the market All holders stand to gain from this measure And this could happen until the BTC halving to take advantage of the bull run  THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TIMING


Cons  This two proposals may decrease CAKE reward in farms However perform an analysis There are two types of suppliers


1 The holder
2 Those who sell CAKE to increase their APR farm


The holder will not be bothered by these measures as they will benefit from them However those who sell CAKE will have two alternatives Either they will start to become holders which is beneficial for the community or they will lose some selling CAKE rewards But okay they can continue selling as the selling pressure will decrease significantly and soon they will realize that selling CAKE is a bad deal


I have been with CAKE since day 1 I saw CAKE go from 029 to 13 then 22 and reaching 44 


Today the protocol built by the devs who deserve ENORMOUS RESPECT AND CONGRATULATIONS FROM THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY for their work is much better than when it reached above 40 So we need to instill more confidence to holde CAKE and to reduce the constant every day selling from farms by those who are only interested in increasing APR Even these individuals should benefit because with a higher CAKE price the suppliers CAKE reward will be greater

It has been brought to the notice of the Swerve Community that a lot of users who are actively involved both in Curve and Swerve communities are being banned from Curve Discord without a justification Some of them are being banned even for simple participation in dialogue on Swerve Discord server

270,"Summary

A proposal by the MechanismCapital 13 team to create a Curve Metapool for Empty Set Dollar ESD and the 3Pool stablecoins USDC USDT and DAI

ESD has been one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins launched to date Its market capitalization has grown to over 65 million in the 2 months since its inception peaked near 100 million

The unique mechanism design of the protocol makes it a strong candidate to become one of the largest stable collateral assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem

Creating an ESD metapool would attract more liquidity to the Curve platform and lead to increased trading fees

Learn more about metapools here httpsresourcescurvefifaqbaseandmetapools 1

Abstract

Empty Set Dollar ESD is a new algorithmic seignioragebased stablecoin that utilizes fixed protocol rules on supply expansion as well as a unique coupon creation  redemption model to incentivize trustless coordination between selfish participants that maintain ESDs synthetic peg 11 with the US dollar all onchain Unlike other algorithmic stable coins like AMPL ESD does not rebase all balances using nonstandard functions but instead adjusts supply through other mechanisms allowing ESD to have the same composability as other standard ERC20 tokens

Currently crypto lacks a truly decentralized and censorshipresistant stablecoin While DAI and sUSD come close they currently have vulnerabilities in their architecture The goal of ESD is to create a truly permissionless scaleable stable store of value that can be used as superfluid collateral in DeFi

Note ESD currently only incentivizes the ESDUSDC Uniswap pool In order to motivate more liquidity to flow to this Curve metapool ESD holders would have to vote to upgrade ESD to incentivize this new pool However various ESD community members have already expressed their support for such a prospective proposal to reward Curve LPs

Liquidity

Total Uniswap Liquidity as of 1132020 152 million

Avg Daily Trading Volume Last 14 Days ended 1132020 375 million

Token Holder Distribution

As of 1142020 there are currently over 853 unique addresses holding ESD This includes 668 staked addresses

Over 90 of ESD tokens were staked to the DAO as of 1132020

Motivation

This is an opportunity for Curve to attract more liquidity to its platform and increase trading fees It would also benefit the ESD community by increasing the efficiency of ESD turnover and accelerating ESD contraction  expansion cycles to further stabilize the price of the token around 1 Finally accelerating the growth of ESD would enhance the antifragility of the entire DeFi ecosystem due to ESDs unique characteristics relative to other stable assets

Specification

This metapool would include ESD USDC USDT and DAI It is likely that the ESD protocol community would vote to incentivize this Curve metapool It already does this for the ESDUSDC pool on Uniswap httpsemptysetfinancepool

For

This pool would bring more liquidity and fees to the Curve protocol

It would also help accelerate and dampen the volatility ESDs expansioncontraction cycles which are currently delayed due to the limitations of slippage on the ESDUSDC Uniswap pool

Successful passage of this proposal would show the Curve communitys willingness to support new innovative protocols  specifically those focused on open and permissionless access to DeFi

Against

ESD is a relatively new and experimental protocol There are both known and unknown risks to explore as the protocol matures These include but are not limited to

ESD is expected to trade within a narrow band around US100 but has experienced short periods of significant volatility

A downward spiral in the instance of zero demand for new coupons though in the current contraction period over 26m coupons have been purchased

Smart contract bugs code is currently under audit and

A design flaw that leads to an economic attack see the recent Harvest Finance attack 1

 TLDR

Proposal to have 45k BAL 31 of the weekly distribution allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity between BAL and uncapped tokens WETH DAI USDC WBTC Wallets flagged as Balancer Labs shareholders dont qualify for this liquidity staking extra incentive
The main goals are to significantly increase liquidity on key BAL pairs and to allow nonshareholders to compound their BAL holdings at a much faster pace accelerating protocol decentralization

image621x500 50upload5S3GvpjON1hNGnO7wuSfqNd3smkpng   


 Motivation

The importance of BAL liquidity cant be overstated

 TRUER PRICE DISCOVERY it improves trading conditions for all market participants lower spreads and less slippage for both buyers and sellers allowing for a more transparent and effective price discovery process

 SUPERIOR LP INCENTIVES a stronger token with higher price inertia results in a higher quality for the incentives given to LPs liquidity providers via liquidity mining

 SHARPER GOVERNANCE it opens doors to a new class of invaluable stakeholders and protocol governors eg larger investors especially those heavily involved in and experienced with DeFi protocols

 BROADER GOVERNANCE with no participation from Balancer Labs shareholders more on that later liquidity staking will accelerate BAL distribution and protocol decentralization by giving all other BAL holders the opportunity to compound their governance rights at a much faster pace

 SAFER GOVERNANCE pools are noncustodial and BAL in them retain full voting power ie no need to withdraw liquidity to vote such that high liquidity and a healthy governance are not in conflict

Balancer itself being a DEX it feels only natural as the ideal venue for high BAL liquidity to be incentivized Finally its worth noting that allowing a high portion of the token supply to be concentrated on centralized exchanges could expose the governance to significant risks as illustrated by the episode with STEEM


 Recapping how liquidity adjustment currently works

The 145k BAL weekly distributionhttpsdocsbalancerfinanceprotocolballiquiditymining to LPs on Balancer is calculated proportionally to the adjusted liquidity contributed by each LP This adjustment is made by applying ie multiplying a few factors to their liquidity measured in dollar terms

Naturally the value of those factors can be
 equal to 1 having no effect
 less than 1 acting as a penalty when the liquidity is deemed less useful
 greater than 1 acting as an extra incentive

A feeFactor  1 see proposalhttpsforumbalancerfinancetmodifyingfeefactortowardreducingtheminingpenaltyforhighfeepools103 applies a small penalty to pools with higher fees

For each pair inside a pool we apply
  a wrapFactor of
    10 for uncorrelated pairs no penalty
    02 for soft pegshttpsforumbalancerfinancetmodifyingwrapfactorapplyinga02factortosoftpeggedpairs138
    01 for hard pegshttpsforumbalancerfinancetwrapfactorpenalizingpairsofequivalenttokensinliquiditymining28 and 

 a BRF BAL  Ratio Factor which is the combination of a ratioFactor  1 see proposalhttpsforumbalancerfinancetintroductionofaweightratiofactorinliquiditymining15 and a stakingBoost  1 described in this proposalhttpsforumbalancerfinancetbalfactorincentivizingballiquidityonbalancer102 and with further calculation details specified in its ammendmenthttpsforumbalancerfinancetbalfactorincentivizingballiquidityonbalancer1024 
BRF  stakingBoost  ratioFactor
   If the pair is not of type BAL  uncapped_token uncapped tokens currently being WETH DAI USDC WBTC BAL then its stakingBoost  1 ie the incentive doesnt apply to this pair

The current BRF will only depend on the characteristics of the pool its tokens and weights and may have a maximum value of 154 It looks like this

image690x455 75uploadxqztRzplangZYzS0j70jlwfgc7Ppng 

After looping through all possible pairs in a pool we combine their factors via weighted averagehttpsgithubcombalancerlabsbalminingscriptsblobmasterlibfactorsjsL111 and the result is a wrapFactor and a BRF for the whole pool 

Finally we calculate and apply a tokenCapFactor adjusting down the liquidity of a token when it exceeds a predetermined maximum Except for the 5 uncapped tokens already mentioned all tokens eligible for liquidity mining are currently capped at 10M each See more details on how to calculate ithttpsforumbalancerfinancetcapfactorcappingeligibleliquidityto10mpertoken56 and the recent changeshttpsforumbalancerfinancetproposaltoupdatethewhitelistprocess217 to how token caps will evolve

 The Proposal

This is a proposal to have 45k BAL 31 of the weekly distribution allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity staking

This extra incentive is

 all BAL distributed as a result of applying a stakingBoost  1 to the liquidity of BAL  uncapped_token pairs from wallets which are not flagged as shareholders of Balancer Labs

The remaining 100k BAL would be distributed to all LPs in all eligible pools disconsidering the effect of a stakingBoost ie all liquidity being subject to BRF  ratioFactor

The constant value now would be STAKERS_SHARE  45000  145000 and we can then calculate the unique value for stakingBoost that satisfies this target distribution 

The intended result is for BAL liquidity on Balancer to increase substantially but in a selfregulated way 

The simple yet powerful idea is as BAL liquidity gets higher the extra incentive to staking gets diluted among stakers so that our constant target for STAKERS_SHARE is met

In a more visual approach
 
 when nonshareholder BAL liquidity is low the stakingBoost will be high resulting in a high BRF a hypothetical scenario being the orange curve in the graph below in which BRF peaks at 12 so there will be a very strong incentive for BAL liquidity to increase

 when nonshareholer BAL liquidity is high the desired scenario the stakingBoost will have come down to lower levels resulting in a lower BRF a hypothetical scenario being the green curve below in which BRF peaks at 3

image621x500uploadoI5XnPgsZE1VcQWDyeJCWovr1IVpng  

 Calculating the stakingBoost a practical example

We first calculate the liquidityPreStaking the total adjusted liquidity from applying all factors but with stakingBoost  1 ie BRF  ratioFactor Lets say the result was 200M

We will need to apply a yet unknown stakingBoost so that
STAKERS_SHARE  finalLiquidity  liquidityPreStaking  finalLiquidity

 which can also be stated as
finalLiquidity  liquidityPreStaking  1  STAKERS_SHARE

In our example
finalLiquidity  200M  1  45000145000  290M

We may apply any temporary tempStakingBoost  1 to BAL  uncapped_token pairs from nonshareholder LPs resulting in a tempLiquidity Lets say our result was 230M This would mean the tempStakingBoost increased the adjusted liquidity in 30M while what we actually want is an increase of 90M

Now to get the desired stakingBoost we only need to stretch or shrink the tempStakingBoost according to the ratio between the two liquidity adjustments desired  temporary


finalLiquidity  liquidityPreStaking  tempLiquidity  liquidityPreStaking  stakingBoost  tempStakingBoost

 which in our example would result in

290  200  230  200  stakingBoost  tempStakingBoost
stakingBoost  3  tempStakingBoost


 Shareholder Addresses

An important aspect of this proposal is that Balancer Labs shareholders investors advisors and founders seem aligned with the spirit of the proposal to accelerate governance rights distribution In order to achieve this goal their wallets will be excluded from participating in liquidity staking This restriction doesnt apply to eventual BAL they hold that are unrelated to their shareholder allocations for instance BAL bought on the market or earned through being LPs with tokens other than their BAL shareholder allocation

Here is the complete list of shareholder addresses to be excluded from liquidity stakinghttpsgithubcombalancerlabsbalminingscriptsblobliquiditystakingsrcusersts

Note wallets currently tagged as Balancer Shareholder XX on Etherscan are actually vesting smart contracts which hold mostly locked ie yet unvested BAL Vesting happens continuously and linearly over a period of 3 years which started at token launch 20200620 When finally vested ie free to transfer BAL can only be withdrawn to the respective beneficiary address of each vesting contract The addresses listed above are the 51 unique beneficiaries of the 51 vesting contracts All the BAL balance they already hold is vested

The community is willing to tolerate up to about 10k BAL per week per shareholder being sent to centralized exchanges as they are cognizant of shareholders also seeking to deleverage their BAL positions over time without attempting to subvert the exclusion list In case some large BAL balances move to thirdparty custody solutions held in segregated addresses or to multisig wallets both situations are likely to happen the current list may be updated to reflect those new shareholder addresses as also excluded from liquidity staking

The community will have the prerogative to update this list so that changes are effective already before any still pending weekly distribution",21.481564004097915

TLDR

As outlined in the new whitelisting processhttpsforumbalancerfinancetproposaltoupdatethewhitelistprocess217 this is a proposal to increase the MKR capFactor from cap3 to cap4 10M  30M MKR has exceeded 10m adjusted liquidity for a period of time MKR bring good liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem



The Proposal

This is a proposal to increase the MKR cap Tier from cap3 to cap4 10M  30M MKR currently has 16M in adjusted liquidity and has probably surpassed its 10M cap for a month

MKR brings useful liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem Before Uniswap used to be the most popular DEX for trading MKR



What is MKR

MKR is a DeFi large cap it currently has a 600M market cap Theres currently 15B locked in MakerDAO and 425M DAI has been minted

SCD Single Collateral DAI was launched in December 2017 MCD Multi Collateral DAI was launched in November 2019

MakerDAO is a decentralized credit platform on Ethereum that supports DAI a stablecoin whose value is pegged to USD Anyone can use Maker to open a Vault lock in collateral such as ETH BAT or WBTC  and generate Dai as debt against that collateral Dai debt incurs a stability fee ie continuously accruing interest which is paid upon repayment of borrowed Dai DAI is collected as system surplus and then used in FLAP auctions to burn MKR

MKR can also be used as a governance token to govern the system MKR holders also act as the last line of defense in case of a black swan event If systemwide collateral value falls too low too fast MKR is minted and sold on the open market to raise more collateral diluting MKR holders

After some explanations from what looked like DZAR team my conclusion about the discussion we had in baldetectives channel on Discord is

DZAR tokens are backed by nothing Buyers have no claims to Digital Rand Pty Ltds assets which own the deposits that you make to get DZAR The DZAR peg to ZAR fiat currency is kept at voluntary efforts of Digital Rand Pty Ltd and the pegging can be terminated at any point in time at discretion of Digital Rand Pty Ltd

DZAR can print unlimited amounts of tokens at their sole discretion

DZAR gets pooled in many 8 asset pools These pools are as safe as the weakest currency DZAR going to 0 will drain these pools to 0 There are millions in these pools If DZAR prints unlimited amount of tokens it will drain all these pools generate large losses and bad publicity

I think that encouraging DZAR liquidity on Balancer creates a big risk for potential liquidity providers joining these pools",22.140178983809136

RPL appears to be a coin with a purpose and a real use case
The 26465785 70 RPL  30 WETH pool is one of the biggest on Balancer and earns BAL at a rate of 10m worth of BALyear

Unfortunately it generates very little volume with 24h volumes oscilating in low tens of thousands of USD last 24h volume 30891

A 2m pool would be enough to facilitate low slippage trading for such volumes so I propose reducing the BAL rewards cap to reduce from 10m to 3m I think that the 10m yearly worth of rewards could be used to encourage other more useful liquidity

On top of the low trading volumes and low interest from traders my subjective opinion is that the valuation is artificially inflated Im not happy about heavy concentration of this pool in hands of a single liquidity provider 90 single LP recently 97 CMC shows that this coin trades 900k on Bilaxy and 300k on LBank within 24h which I find hard to believe httpscoinmarketcapcomcurrenciesrocketpoolmarkets",22.881186535540106

 Summary

Introduce govFactor an onchain voting factor of 11 for Balancer Liquidity Providers

If passed the govFactor will initially be implemented as a 3 month trial with voter participation acting as the key success metric 

 Background

_  FireEyesDAOhttpsmediumcomfireeyesdao has been actively working with the Balancer team over the past few months in an effort to develop a robust suite of governance mechanisms to complement the upcoming launch of Balancer V2

One of the issues we concluded on consistent voter participation has historically been an issue for many DeFi protocols Whether it results in proposals not reaching quorum or only having a small number of participants involved its become obvious that protocols need to drive meaningful voter participation across a diverse group of users

The govFactor creates a simple incentive mechanism for liquidity providers LPs to actively participate in governance 

 Motivation

As it stands Balancer liquidity mining encourages passive participation Liquidity Providers LPs simply deposit capital into the protocol and earn BAL Despite the significant subsidy LPs receive in the form of governance tokens theres no expectation or requirement that they actively participate in governance

This ultimately represents a misalignment as LPs have no incentive to vote despite constantly accruing voting weight If the suppliers are subsidized by the protocol with governance power they should be willing stewards of the protocol as well

This does not mean that LPs MUST participate but instead they should have an incentive to participate Therefore it may be worthwhile to incentivize those that service the protocol to help govern it as well aligning their participation with additional weighting to their weekly liquidity mining rewards 

 Specification

The govFactor is an onchain voting incentive for LPs that affects BAL liquidity mining allocations depending on whether or not an address voted on the last governance proposal The implementation multiplies BAL amounts each LP gets by their govFactor 11 for those who voted 10 for those who did not and then normalizes all amounts so that the sum is still 145000 BAL per week 

The govFactor will operate as an onoff switch where LPs that voted on the most recent proposal by signing a transaction turn on the factor

Providers that did not vote on the last proposal by signing a transaction have their govFactor off forfeiting the factor and in turn receive lower LP rewards than those that voted on the last proposal This dynamic will remain off until the next onchain proposal is open for voting and ratified onchain

If all LPs vote then the rewards remain the same as if no one votes

 To make calculations as simple as possible govFactor would be applied after all other factors

GovFactor looks at addresses who have voted on the most recent proposal featured on Snapshot and references to see if the address is also providing liquidity to the protocol If both variables are met the protocol includes a factor to their weekly BAL liquidity mining allocation

Its important to note that this reference happens entirely onchain meaning theres no need to crosslink any addresses to a forum or public username

Ultimately the govFactor creates a unified incentive for those that service the protocol to become active governance participants as well and should be considered by the community as a simple mechanism for encouraging governance participation from the protocols supplyside actors  

 Drawbacks

Some points to consider surrounding the GovFactor

 The end result could be a lot of nonengaged voting coming from LPs who dont hold meaningful amounts of BAL even if being large LPs and who dont really care about Balancer governance putting little to no effort in the decision process behind their votes
 The GovFactor encourages LPs to vote through their liquidity mining address which could pose some issues for opsec conscious users However Snapshot now enables delegation from cold wallets which would mitigate this issue 
 The cadence between different governance proposals is likely to differ This means that someone who votes on the last proposal preceding a large time gap to the next proposal may see increased liquidity rewards despite not actively participating in governance discussions
 The state of Balancer Governance is relatively idle and therefore implementing a governance incentive isnt currently necessary for the success of the protocol",15.355424498511686

The DEXG liquidity on Balancer surpassed 3M with a total liquidity of 38M currently pooled Therefore we propose to increase the capFactor from cap1 to cap2

What is DEXG

DEXG is the governance token of the DEXToken Protocol The DEXToken Protocol creates a unique DeFi infrastructure featuring a revolutionary AMM and utilising the offchain capabilities of the Flowchain IoT network Currently the involved smart contracts are in open beta testing on the Ropsten Test Network The Mainnet launch is planned within Q1 2021",10.366857458449134
302,"This proposal also appears on Balancers forumhttpsforumbalancerfinancetproposalbalforgas1437 If approved changes would take effect at 0000 UTC on Monday March 8

On behalf of the Balancer community Id like to propose significant modifications to the ongoing gas reimbursement campaign We have heard some concerns that the campaign is confusing and that it isnt clear how much BAL a user will receive for a given trade During these times of network congestion and high gas costs we want to provide everyone with an opportunity to trade on Balancer With that in mind it doesnt seem fair to ask users to exercise blind faith and wait until next Wednesday to find out what theyve earned from trading We would like to make every effort to simplify the campaign and improve transparency what you see is what you get or at least as close as possible We plan to accomplish this by removing various sources of uncertainty from the reimbursement calculations so that it is possible to get an estimate ahead of time and display it to the user at the time of trade submission

 The Proposal
Allocate 30000 BAL from the Ecosystem Fund to the BAL for Gas campaign There is no fixed time period the budget is consumed on a firstcome firstserved basis When the budget is exhausted the campaign is suspended until it is replenished by BAL governance

For each eligible trade made through the Balancer Exchange Proxy award claimable BAL tokens to the trader An eligible trade is a trade containing one or more eligible swaps where an eligible swap is a swap between any two tokens on the whitelisthttpsgithubcombalancerlabsassetsblobmasterlistseligiblejson Claims are made available at the BAL claims interfacehttpsclaimbalancerfinance on Wednesday UTC time following the close of the weekly period 0000 UTC Monday  2359 UTC Sunday in which the trade occurred

The amount of gas to be reimbursed is predetermined by the number of eligible swaps within the transaction

table690x185httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard10uploadsbalanceroriginal1Xdd83c24ba43bd36e91396a5b6296f4c92cc986c2png

For converting gas to BAL use the median gas price of the enclosing block and the BALETH price from CoinGecko closest to the block time

 Motivation
The proposal above may seem familiar but there are some very important distinctions between this and the previous reimbursement program All modifications share the common goal of improving user experience which we believe is a matter of simplification and transparency

First this proposed campaign makes no effort to account for the _actual_ expenses of the user Both the amount of gas consumed by the transaction and the gas price ultimately paid are irrelevant Instead deterministic figures are favored the amount of gas is fixed depending on the number of swaps and the gas price is the block median rather than the users own price It is simply too difficult to accurately predict the parameters of a given transaction ahead of time whereas it is much easier to predict blockwide parameters Predictability informs transparency

The second major shift pertains to the budget The existing program allocates a fixed weekly budget which can sometimes necessitate cuts to the reimbursements in order to avoid excess spending Such cuts can only be known _after_ the weekly period has ended and therefore the existence of a weekly budget renders any tradetime estimates useless In contrast here we propose a fixed total budget which is distributed on a firstcome firstserved basis This allows us to add reimbursement estimates to the Exchange UI at the time of the trade If there are still funds remaining in the budget the user will see an estimate of the amount of BAL to be awarded and if the budget is exhausted then the user will simply be informed as such and the estimate will be zero When the well runs dry BAL governors can decide whether to replenish and continue the campaign

Third the BALETH price model is modified Whereas the ongoing campaign uses the median price for the whole weekly period the proposed campaign uses the price as close as possible to the actual block time Knowing the approximate price at the time of the trade allows us to make informed estimates about the amount of BAL to be awarded

image690x120httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard10uploadsbalanceroriginal1Xe00a59183e29b37e29369999caccc6035028b810png

Finally the fixed amounts of gas 130k 220k 300k 400k were chosen so that only 1 of all trades on average would be overcompensated This should be sufficient to prevent gaming the system for profit but nonetheless we reserve the right to filter out suspicious activity The Balancer Exchange UI will never perform more than four swaps in a single trade which is why only four numbers are provided any transactions containing 5 swaps must belong to bots whereas the target audience is end users We simply cap the reimbursement amount at 400000 gas any additional eligible swaps beyond the first four will yield no further benefit

 Mechanics
Although every effort is made to be as transparent and accurate as possible there is still a very small amount of room for error Here we will detail how the BAL amounts are computed both at trade time estimated and at dispersal time actual

At the time of the trade

1 Determine the number of eligible swaps An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the whitelisthttpsgithubcombalancerlabsassetsblobmasterlistseligiblejson
2 The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps 130000 gas for one swap 220000 gas for two swaps 300000 gas for three swaps and 400000 gas for four or more swaps
3 The estimated gas price for display purposes is the median from the last few blocks according to the getGasPrice function from the web3 provider This should provide a good corollary to the median of the actual trade block which cannot be known in advance
4 The estimated BALETH price for display purposes is queried from the large 8020 BALWETH poolhttpspoolsbalancerexchangepool0x59a19d8c652fa0284f44113d0ff9aba70bd46fb4 This acts as a realtime oracle which isnt worth manipulating because it is only used to display an estimate and not to compute an actual award amount
5 The user will see in one summary number the final result of 14 the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for this particular trade assuming there are still funds left in the budget A USD estimate is also provided for completeness with the BALUSD price being queried from CoinGeckos API

The UI changes are still being finalized but as a mockup consider the image below

At dispersal time computed by the open source mining scriptshttpsgithubcombalancerlabsbalminingscripts

1 Determine the number of eligible swaps An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the whitelisthttpsgithubcombalancerlabsassetsblobmasterlistseligiblejson
2 The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps 130000 gas for one swap 220000 gas for two swaps 300000 gas for three swaps and 400000 gas for four or more swaps
3 The actual gas price is the median from the block containing the trade We will filter out artificially lowprice transactions which are sometimes included by miners and can skew the median  these are typically 0gwei or 1gwei transactions
4 The actual BALETH price is queried from the CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade

It should be clear that the only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are most likely quite small the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block and the 8020 BALWETH price may not perfectly match CoinGeckos BALETH price All in all the user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time and this improved user experience should bring more traders to the campaign

 The Proposal

After the activation of the Balancer Based Safety Module 20 Days ago the liquidity for AAVE quickly grew to be the Largest Balancer protocol Liquidity Pool as new LPs join the AAVEBAL incentivized Safety Module

image690x101httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard10uploadsbalanceroriginal1X464af158056f0a77cbf50195bfc2bb8a987826c1png 

Current APY by staking in the Safety Module is 2934 only considering the AAVE rewards The Pool is still growing and Balancer is now the best protocol to swap AAVE onchain

As BAL is a collateral option in Aave aBPT stakers can use their BAL rewards to unlock more borrowing power in the Aave Protocol

Uncapping the BAL rewards for the AAVEETH pool will allows even further incentive to bring more liquidity onchain and increase the synergies between the Aave  Balancer protocols

 What is The Safety Module

The Aave Safety Module acts as a collateral for the whole Aave ecosystem AAVE holders and now  with the new Balancer Based Stake  AAVEETH holders benefit from long term rewards for securing the protocol from insolvency while at the same time bearing the risk of being slashed in case of shortfall events

 Summary

Vote on whether or not the Balancer protocol should extend the govFactorhttpssnapshotorgbalancerproposalQmWtk4pJ2CNhmLFK9Nhk5gGD7xr2KbsK4cfpFXyR9YCbYG and keep it in perpetuity for Balancer V1 liquidity mining  

 Motivation

The govFactor was initially implemented as a trial to test voting incentives for the Balancer Protocol The trial was successful as voter participation increased substantially across the board for all Snapshot Proposals 

For reference the three most recent proposals prior to the govFactor vote averaged 91000 BAL 053 of circulating supply compared to the three most recent proposals today which averaged 12M BAL 70 of the circulating supply in tokenholder participation

With the upcoming transition to Balancer V2 there are no factors Therefore the govFactor will not be implemented in V2 liquidity mining 

This proposal aims to identify whether or not the Balancer protocol should keep the govFactor in perpetuity for V1 liquidity mining 

 Specification 

The govFactor is a 11x factor applied to the adjusted liquiditythe liquidity measured in USD terms after all other factors have been appliedof V1 LPs who voted on the most recent Snapshot proposals

 Motivation

Crypto moves fast and the AMM space is as competitive as ever In order to stay relevant and to attract significant liquidity Balancer needs to implement a flexible Liquidity Mining Program which targets high priority pools and can respond quickly to changing market conditions 

Unfortunately this can result in significant overhead for normal BAL governance Constantly weighing in voting and checking the forums on a daily basis can be a hassle for most BAL holders 

As a result this proposes having a dedicated committee of core members to the Balancer protocol to lead this charge and ensure that the protocol is always incentivizing the right pools at the right time

 Specification

Balancer V2 Liquidity mining incentives will operate in three tiers governed by a combination of BAL governance and the Ballers Committee 

Screen Shot 20210413 at 91421 PM690x74httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard10uploadsbalanceroriginal1X98f34188a9d69eb4eac9cd5149b3f831a85a27a7png 

Tier 1 will be voted on by BAL governance while Tier 2 and Tier 3 are voted on by the Ballers committee 

All Balancer community members will retain the right to make proposals and signal support for T2  T3 Liquidity Mining inclusion The Ballers Committe will act as a liason between community sentiment and formal changes to the program Discussions on Liquidity Mining inclusion will be open for all community members on both Discord and the Forum 

The Ballers Committee will have no control over the Tier 1 slots Instead they will be governed by normal BAL governance which will be put up for vote every 12 weeks Additionally all decisons made by the Ballers Committee along with voting addresses will be made public for everyone to see prior to implementation

In order to accomodate for sufficient yield to attract liquidity on certain pools more than one slot may be allocated to a single pool by consuming additional T2 and T3 slots as voted on by the committee 

The timing for changes on each tier outlined above is a guidelineBAL governance and the Ballers Committee will always have the right to change tiers if the market conditions deem it necessary examples include rug pulls bugs and other issues which would require quick response by governance  

 BALETH Pool

In order to mitigate the reduction in yields for the BALETH pair the Ballers committee will aim to target the existing returns in V1 6070 APY through the use of additional T2  T3 slots

Its important to highlight that there are a significant amount of variables that will affect the BALETH APY as well as all other pools This includes amount of liquidity migrated during the transition amount staked tiers consumed etc 

With all those variables The Ballers Committee will be responsible for trying to ensure that the APY on the BALETH pool are in line with the above 

 Transition from V1 to V2 Mining
The transition from Balancer V1 liquidity mining to V2 will be gradual and take several weeks This will start with only a few of the Tier 3 T3 and Tier 2 T2 slots being filled by top priority pools with new slots being activated on a rolling basis targeting every week 

At every activation the corresponding amount of BAL is subtracted from the weekly amount available in the V1 liquidity mining program This way the total BAL distributed through liquidity mining between both V1 and V2 pools will always stay the same at 145000 BAL per week

As the community becomes more confident that there are no vulnerabilities in the V2 smart contracts more of the liquidity mining program is expected to shift from V1 to V2 until the entirety of the V1 allocation is exhausted This can happen by having more of the available slots being assigned to V2 pools and also by upgrading a V2 pool to a higher tier

The transition period will aim to take roughly 8 weeks from the start of V2 mining At the end of the transition period Tier 1 slots will be allocated to these pools

 Ballers Committe

The selection of Tier 2 and Tier 3 Liquidity Mining Pools will discussed on a weekly basis according to community input and signal and voted on formally by the Ballers Commmitee 

The Ballers Committe is open to everyone Any engaged individuals in the community can be elected by fellow community members to join the committee More on this below 

The goal of using the Ballers Committee is to avoid extensive overhead on BAL governance as well as to provide quick responses according to market conditions 

Ballers will use a specific Snapshot space separate space from traditional BAL governance so that the community can easily keep track of those decisions

All decisions made by Ballers will be made public on Balancers forum shortly after the end of the committee weekly meetings ideally within 23 hours Highly respected individuals and working groups in the space may also be invited by Ballers to these meetings to provide strategic input That said they will have no formal voting rights on Snapshot

 Additional Background on Ballers 

Ballers are active members of the community that have gone above and beyond by contributing significant resources and time to the Balancer Protocol There are currently 10 Ballers in the community as assigned by their tag on DiscordhttpsdiscordggARJWaeF 

Ballers are currently elected by the team at Balancer Labs however there intends to be a formal governance process by BAL holders surrounding the election of future Ballers and the encompassing committee 

With that The Ballers group is expected to expand and rotate over time encouraging regular community members to keep a high level of engagement so they can eventually become Ballers too

BAL governance has the ultimate power to elect and dismiss Ballers through Snapshot votes Ballers and the broader community will constantly assess how participative Ballers are and how good their decisions on the allocation of liquidity mining slots are

 Drawbacks

 The Ballers Committee is a small group of individuals and can poses centralization risks collusion etc Its important to note that BAL governance always retains the right to remove Ballers from their position In addition becoming a Baller is a selective process and requires a significant amount dedication to the protocolmeaning theyre extremely aligned with the success of Balancer 
 This structure would eliminate liquidity incentives for the longtail of pools This is true however the upgrade to Balancer V2 drastically increases gas efficiency and creates a natural incentive for project teams to drive liquidity to Balancer given its competitive conditions for trading namely lower gas costs Importantly some competitors dont offer liquidity incentives at all and still have sufficient liquidity for the longtail of assets We believe that V2s upgrade is substantial enough to compete with this market dynamic 

 Summary

Balancer V2 liquidity mining will operate in 3 tiers Tier 1 will be voted on by governance on a recurring basis while Tier 2 and Tier 3 pools will be strategically assigned by the Ballers Committee based on community sentiment 

Its important to highlight that certain pools may be allocated more than one slot by the committee For instance the BALETH pool may be elected multiple slots in order for the APY to tentatively match the BALETH APY on V1 as mentioned

All community members will always have the ability to signal their support for liquidity mining inclusion for T2 and T3 pools in order to guide the committee 

The transition from V1 to V2 will take place over a targeted 8 weeks with BAL liquidity mining allocations incrementally migrated to V2 on a weekly basis Throughout the entirety of the migration the weekly BAL distribution will remain constant at 145000 BAL per week spread across both Balancer V1 and V2",11.658404727168284

As part of Aaves Safety Modulehttpsdocsaavecomaavenomicssafetymodule an 8020 AAVEWETH pool was created which has since grown to be the largest pool on Balancer v1 The creation of this pool along with the dual incentives of BAL  AAVE established a strong partnership between Balancer and Aave That partnership has continued with the ongoing development of the Aave Asset Manager AM which will be the first AM deployed on Balancer v2

Motivation

Given the critical importance of the Safety Module Aave requires additional time to migrate their pool to Balancer v2 In order to preserve the allocation of 12500 BAL per week the pool was receiving before v2 Liquidity Mining started we need to give Ballers the authority to allocate BAL to the 8020 AAVEWETH pool on v1

Specification

The Ballers will initially allocate two Tier 2 slots and one Tier 3 slot for a combined 12500 BAL per week  this will be reflected in the next weekly vote on the Balleronly snapshot Going forward the Ballers will have sole discretion to adjust this pools allocation as they see fit The BAL allocated to this pool by the Ballers will go directly to users who have staked BPT from this pool in the Safety Module meaning if you enter this pool and do not stake in the Safety Module you will not get BAL rewardsThis pool will no longer be included in the v1 reward calculations

Note Aave has agreed to a three month migration deadline BAL rewards will be provided during this time period though not necessarily at the full 12500 BAL per week Ballers can choose to lower the amount if they deem it appropriate At the end of three months if they have not migrated to v2 then BAL rewards for their pool will end The migration deadline will be September 20th 2021",15.266210858690563

 Core Proposal
Given the conditions outlined above I propose stopping this initiative with immediate effect

 Risk Assessment
The halting of this program might result in a reduction in trading activity from those firsttime users not familiar with Balancer inner mechanisms claiming function and Gnosis

 Open Questions
This proposal does not impact the general long term vision of the protocol

This proposal does not require funding",12.3518073234903

For some background on the governance multisig hereafter referred to as the DAO multisig you can check out this section of the docshttpsdocsbalancerfiecosystemgovernancemultisig 

 Motivation

Currently the Balancer DAO treasury is controlled by Balancer Labs  handing over direct control to the DAO is a key step in furthering decentralization of our operations

To be clear this proposal does not give the DAO multisig any decision making powers Its sole responsibility is to enact legitimately passed snapshot votes

The current list of signers is as follows

Alexander Lange Inflection
Ash Egan Accomplice
Solarcurve Baller
Fabien Snapshot Labs
Jake Brukhman CoinFund
Kain Warwick Synthetix
Mariano Conti Ethereum
David Hoffman Bankless
Trent McConaghy Ocean Protocol
Cooper Turley Fireeyes

Kevin Owocki Gitcoin will be retiring as a signer We thank him for his service

As part of this proposal a list of replacement candidates has been prepared In the event a signer wishes to voluntarily leave someone from this list may be chosen at the discretion of the DAO Multisig as a replacement Any replacement will be announced in discord and the Balancer twitter account

Danielmk BeethovenX
Bakamoto Baller  Head of Liquidity Mining committee
Zeb Balancer Grants DAO
Evgeny Yurtaev CEO at Zerion
Hart Lambur Cofounder at UMA

Note that BAL holders retain the ability to replace DAO multisig signers at any time and no one can be added as a signer without the approval of BAL holders unless they appear on the above list Having the candidate list is intended to ease the transition period so operations can continue seamlessly in the event several signers decide to leave abruptly

Additionally a stipend of 500 BAL every six months will be payable to DAO multisig signers They are free to opt out of this if they desire The stipend will be distributed at the end of each six month period If a signer leaves before that they are eligible to receive it prorated The first period will begin upon the approval of this proposal

 Specification
If approved this proposal seeks to transfer control over Balancer DAOs treasury funds located at 0xb618f903ad1d00d6f7b92f5b0954dcdc056fc533 to the DAO multisig address 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f All assets would be transferred by Balancer Labs to this new address

Additionally the DAO multisig signers would create a gnosis safe on Fantom to hold Balancer DAOs allocation of BEETS as part of the recently passed friendly fork proposal Note that in the future the DAO multisig could operate wallets on other networks as required by future friendly forks or other activities  these would not require governance votes but addresses and activities will always be public and transparent

Finally some BAL still remains allocated as part of past Grant waves Balancer Labs will determine the exact amount but this is the reason not all BAL might be transferred over to the DAO multisig",15.237036723164032
310,"This proposal appears on Balancers forumhttpsforumbalancerfitproposalboostedpoolsauthorizegauntletandtheballersmultisigtomanagepoolparameters2400

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week and the Balancer app now supports them too

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable Gauntlet and a multisig controlled by Ballers to control certain parameters of the Boosted Pools so as to increase their capital efficiency and returns to liquidity providers

 Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts  AaveLinearPool and StablePhantomPool  contain a series of parameters that affect their efficiency and can be tuned depending on market conditions

 Boosted Stable Pools  StablePhantomPool 
   swap fee
   amplification parameter
   token rate cache duration
 Boosted Linear Pools  AaveLinearPool 
   swap fee
   lower target
   upper target

Gauntlet has been managing fees and amplification factor in weighted and stable pools and would be able to do so for Boosted Stable Pools if this proposal is approved by the community

The duration of the token rate cache can have an impact on a boosted pools capital efficiency If the duration is too long the pool can be arbed for all the interest accrued on Aave since the last update of the cache A short duration mitigates this risk with the downside of increasing gas costs for trades

On Linear Pools swap fees are not collected by liquidity providers but rather act as an incentive for arbitragerskeepers to

1 withdraw main tokens from the pool deposit them in Aave and deposit the aTokens in the pool when it has main tokens in excess
2 withdraw aTokens from the pool withdraw the underlying from Aave and deposit the main token to the pool when it has a low balance of main tokens

The lower and upper targets determine a range within which no fee in imposed on trades between main tokens and Aave tokens A trader moving the balance of main tokens away from this range pays a fee to the pool which the pool then returns to traders that move the balance back towards the range

While were confident that Gauntlet can hit the ground running with respect to optimizing the swap fee and amplification factor of Boosted Stable Pools theres still much to be learned when it comes to the other four parameters described above For this reason this proposal would authorize a multisig held by Ballers to set those parameters Balancer Labs would monitor the activiy on the pools and the market conditions and advise on the the best course of action but Ballers would be the ultimate decision makers acting on behalf of BAL holders All updates would be announced in Discord beforehand

311,"This proposal appears on Balancers forumhttpsforumbalancerfitproposalboostedpoolsauthorizebalancerlabstoemergencypause2399

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week and the Balancer app now supports them too

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable a multisig controlled by Balancer Labs team members to control the Boosted Pools emergency pause mechanism during its first 3 months

 Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts  AaveLinearPool and StablePhantomPool  have an emergency pause period which is hardcoded at 3 months from the time the factories were deployed During the pause period the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise Funds can always be withdrawn by users  even during an emergency pause and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk

Since gathering 611 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient we propose also authorizing a Balancer Labs controlled multisig to pause the system  The BLabs Multisighttpsetherscanioaddress0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B will be controlled by a handful of team members at Balancer Labs Note that after the 3month pause period ends neither the Governance Multisig nor the BLabs Multisig will have any pause power

An important distinction between the pause mechanism in Boosted Pools and that of previous pool types and of the vault is that Boosted Pools are not supposed to be unpaused In practice after a pool is paused users should withdraw assets from the pool and a new pool should be deployed In the event that the pause mechanism must be triggered Balancer Labs will commit resources to draw attention from liquidity providers to the fact that they must withdraw their funds

 Specification

 Motivation

Recently Fei Labs announced Tribe Turbohttpsmediumcomfeiprotocolthetribedaostronglybelievesthatahealthyandthrivingdefiecosystemneedsarobustplatformb1faea700dfa a way for DAOs to issue Fei at no cost into Fuse pools of their choice The Treasury subDAO has been evaluating this opportunity and believes there is likely market demand for users to borrow against their BPTs Balancer Pool Tokens while still earning any BAL or other token incentives Credit to Jared for preparing this helpful infographic which illustrates what will take place

As part of the recent treasury swap with Fei Balancer DAO has 245M FEI As an initial allocation to gauge market demand we propose to deposit 100k BAL into Turbo Fuse Pool x and borrow up to 10 of the current market value in FEI  we will also add 1M FEI from our current holdings for a total of 11  12M FEI to be deposited into Fuse Pool y

The Treasury subDAO will monitor the health of the FEI loan against our 100k BAL and either add more BAL collateral or pay down the debt using our existing FEI holdings to protect against any possibility of liquidation

The initial list of BPTs users can deposit into Fuse Pool y will be wstETHWETH WBTCWETH WETHDAI WETHBAL WBTCrenBTCsBTC FEIWETH bbfUSD Fuse boosted pool DAIFEILUSD and bbaUSD Aave Boosted Pool DAIUSDCUSDT As previously mentioned any liquidity mining incentives will still be captured so users do not miss out on any yield by using Fuse Pool y

Since Tribe DAO has a lot of experience managing Fuse pools the Treasury subDAO will let them manage Fuse Pool y However the Treasury subDAO will retain decision making authority around addingremoving BPTs and setting the maximum LTV for each BPT Any decision would be given to Tribe DAO to execute

An important final consideration is that any FEI borrowed through Turbo Fuse Pool x is subject to an 8020 split of the borrow interest with 80 going to Tribe DAO and 20 to Balancer DAO Treasury subDAO has provided feedback that a 5050 split would make increased usage of Turbo more palatable though for now the 8020 split remains the most likely reality Credit to Jared again for this comparison of both revenue scenarios

 KPI

Treasury subDAO is targetting a minimum of 50 utilization on borrowable FEI in Fuse Pool y as a sign that market demand does exist for borrowing against BPT collateral This metric will be assessed 30 days after our deposit into Turbo to show either this is a worthwhile allocation of capital or we need to reconsider the value add 

 Risks

 Turbo is a new product that while audited is untested There is the possibility of a smart contract bug which causes a complete loss of our BAL deposited as collateral to Fuse Pool x
   Mitigation Tribe DAO has offered to give us an OTC insurance quote This can be pursued if the Treasury subDAO feels it is appropriate

 If utilization of FEI is very high in Fuse Pool y and the price of BAL drops very quickly it may not be possible to withdraw FEI from Fuse Pool y to repay the FEI we borrowed from Fuse Pool x This scenario could result in liquidation of the BAL we deposited to Fuse Pool x
   Mitigation Treasury subDAO should be prepared to add additional BAL collateral andor use other liquid cashequivalent assets in Balancer DAOs treasury like USDC or FEI to repay the Fuse Pool x loan in an emergency Additionally it may take several days for the DAO Multisig to execute the necessary transactions which must be factored in
 Tribe DAO calls the loan in Fuse Pool x This would trigger a four week period where Balancer DAO must repay the FEI we borrowed in full or risk the BAL collateral being seized
   Mitigation Similar to the previous one We cannot rely on being able to withdraw FEI from Fuse Pool y in such an emergency so keeping cashequivalent liquid assets ready to use in this kind of situation is important
 Manipulation of the oracle that prices BPT in Fuse Pool y This could result in an exploit that drains funds from Fuse Pool y
   Mitigation BPTs represent full range liquidity  previous instances of this manipulation in Fuse pools has been the result of relying on a Uniswap V3 oracle which represents concentrated liquidity in a specific range Thus the risk of this exploit should be very low If it happens we might lose the FEI we deposited to Fuse Pool y so wed need to repay our FEI loan using our own funds

 Specification

The Treasury subDAO already has the authority to farm with idle nonBAL assets so only a social vote of the subDAO signers is required to allocate FEI from our current holdings into Fuse Pool y In order to make use of Turbo Fuse Pool x we require authorization from BAL token holders to use some of the DAOs BAL holdings

The Treasury subDAO requests that governance delegate us the power to allocate up to 500000 BAL to Turbo Fuse Pool x This will allow us to scale up from the initial deposit of 100000 BAL if we deem it appropriate

Specification for the transactions required from the DAO Multisig will follow once it becomes available",13.161677378970982
313,"This proposal appears on Balancers forumhttpsforumbalancerfitproposalgovernanceprocessrevamp202548

 Motivation 

Almost four months ago Balancers governance process was formally overhauled and handed off to the DAO through this proposalhttpsvotebalancerfiproposal0x3bbcaaad4f0a928b8dabaf97bfd9679752254aee6e63597df32a7453663354d6 Overall I would argue the revamp did increase the transparency and effectiveness of our governance process but some critical problems have become clear to me lately

The ultimate authority of our governance process is BAL token holders Currently in order for a proposal to proceed for a vote it must have a majority of the Gov Council signal that the proposal has reached soft consensus in the community Ballers and DAO contributors represent the majority of active community members Its not a stretch to imagine a scenario where large token holders support a proposal but the Ballersactive community do not We have created a system where the Gov Council acts as gatekeepers with full control over what proceeds to a vote and what doesnt

Thus I would make the argument that soft consensus in the community should NOT be a factor when considering a proposal to move forward to a vote We must avoid the situation where core DAO contributors are against a proposal that has large token holder support and that proposal does not proceed to a vote because it lacks soft consensus in the community

 Specification

The Gov Council will remain in place and their approval will still be required for a proposal to move to a vote However they will not vote on whether soft consensus in the community has been reached Instead the question will be Is this a well defined proposal

What is the criteria for a well defined proposal

 Includes a Motivation Specification and if applicable a Risks section
 If onchain execution from the DAO Multisig is required the Specification section must contain transaction details address to send funds to contract to interact withfunction to call etc
 The intent of the proposal must be clear not spam
 BAL token holders must have the power to implement the proposal
   Example A proposal is made to deposit the FEI in our treasury into a new degen farm As part of the subDAO formation proposalhttpsvotebalancerfiproposal0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66 the power to farm was delegated to the Treasury subDAO BAL token holders cannot vote on how we farm with nonBAL treasury assets so this proposal would not proceed to a vote However a proposal to remove the power to farm from the Treasury subDAO is within the scope of BAL token holders If this proposal passes successfully then the proposal to farm with FEI could go to a vote
   Example A proposal is made to deploy Balancer to Optimism Balancer Labs has sole discretion over core protocol development BAL token holders do not have the power to compel Balancer Labs to act It is solely the choice of Balancer Labs to create an official deployment of Balancer on Optimism or not Thus this proposal would not proceed to a vote as BAL token holders lack the power to implement it
   Example A proposal is made to deposit 100k BAL to Aave to earn a yield BAL token holders have the power to allocate BAL held in the treasury so as long as the other criteria for a well defined proposal are met this would proceed to a vote

If the Gov Council fails to execute their duties in good faith and votes against a well defined proposal proceeding to a vote a proposal to replace the Gov Council with a different mechanism should be made ASAP

Finally this proposal would also implement a required minimum quorum of 100k BAL Any snapshot vote that does not reach 100k total BAL voted AND at least 51 voting in favor would be considered to fail",13.168258139934952

This proposal aims to authorize an updated version of the Batch Relayer which adds unwrapping capabilities for ERC4626 tokenshttpseipsethereumorgEIPSeip4626 and UnbuttonTokenshttpsgithubcombuttonwoodprotocolbuttonwrappersblobmaincontractsUnbuttonTokensolL18 For reference the original Batch Relayerhttpsvotebalancerfiproposal0xedff802a4ffb1ba0e131c7d4126fa669648a9333860a74de57c9e5971b9ec541 enabled atomic sequences of swaps joins and exits as well as unwrapping of stETH and Aave aTokens Batch Relayer V2 retains all of those features from V1

This proposal seeks authorization for Batch Relayer V2 only on Polygon as it is anticipated that a Batch Relayer V3 will soon be available on all networks This intermediate release is targeted specifically at a new USD Boosted Pool on Polygon

 Add and remove liquidity on the users behalf

The team at Overnighthttpsovernightfi who created the USD yieldbearing stable coin played a significant role in the development of the new ERC4626LinearPoolhttpsgithubcombalancerlabsbalancerv2monorepoblobmasterpkgpoollinearcontractserc4626ERC4626LinearPoolsol This pool supports tokens implementing the recently finalized EIP4626 Tokenized Vault StandardhttpseipsethereumorgEIPSeip4626 and the Balancer Integrations Team believes it has the potential to open up Boosted Pools to a plethora of yieldbearing tokens We thank Overnight for their patience throughout the integrations process and would like to add relayer support for their new pool as soon as possible

The relayer will enable trades involving the rebasing USD which is incompatible with the Balancer Vault It does this by unwrapping fromto the StaticUsdPlus token which is an ERC4626 token wrapper that removes the rebasing component This will effectively create direct markets for USD on Balancer not only via DAI USDC and USDT but also via multihop to any other connected token within the Vault For example the relayer would enable the following atomic DAIUSD trade

1 perform a multihop batch swap from DAI to StaticUsdPlus through the USD Boosted Pool
2 unwrap the StaticUsdPlus tokens from step 1 receiving plain USD tokens

 Risks

This proposal would only grant the required roles to the BalancerRelayer contract Each user would still be required to opt into the relayer by submitting an approval transaction or signing a message

The code is a simple wrapper over existing Balancer pool interactions and it has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the Balancer Labs team

The addresses of the BalancerRelayer and BatchRelayerLibrary mentioned in this proposal can be found in the official repohttpsgithubcombalancerlabsbalancerv2monorepopull1182commitscc113a4aaa9f3869a5accfdf236eafd6528a74d2

 Specification

The Balancer governance multisig on Polygon would submit a transaction to the Authorizer in order to grant the following roles to the BalancerRelayer

1 manageUserBalance  Utilize existing Vault allowances and internal balances so that a user does not have to reapprove the new relayer for each token
2 joinPool  Add liquidity to a pool on the users behalf
3 exitPool  Remove liquidity from a pool on the users behalf
4 swap  Trade within a single pool on the users behalf
5 batchSwap  Make a multihop trade or source liquidity from multiple pools
6 setRelayerApproval  Approve the relayer on the users behalf user must still provide a signed message

The Gnosis Safe at 0xd2bD536ADB0198f74D5f4f2Bd4Fe68Bae1e1Ba80 would send a transaction to the Vault Authorizer at 0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6 with the following data to authorize the BalancerRelayer at 0xF537dDd7f4cc72C6C08866b62EAe9378f1F62da8

 Protocol Description

HAUShttpsdaohausclubtoken is the governance token for DAOhaus

DAOhaus is a home for purposedriven community DAOs The DAOhaus platform is a humanfriendly interface for communities to collectively deploy and manage Moloch DAOs https mediumcomraidguildmolochevolvedv2primer25c9cdeab455 Over 2000 DAOs have been summoned on the DAOhaus platform to date with over 10000 individual DAO members and millions of dollars worth of crypto assets secured in DAO treasuries

 Governance UberHaus and Warcamp

DAOhaus is governed by UberHaushttpsuberhausclub a DAO whose members are themselves DAOs that use the DAOhaus platform UberHaus powers include governing the noncirculating HAUS supply

Uberhaus delegates appointed by each DAO according to their own processes meet weekly to discuss Uberhaus business Proposals are made with a 4 day voting period and a 14 day grace period during which member DAOs can exercise their right to  ragequit ie exit the DAO with their full share of the treasury This credible threat of exit creates a robust balance of power within the DAO and incentivizes seeking consensus whenever possible

UberHaus funds one of its member DAOs  Warcamp  to build maintain and promote the DAOhaus platform All core contributors to DAOhaus are members of and receive compensation from the Warcamp DAO Warcamp members are admins of the DAOhaus Github repos

 HAUS Price History

The majority of the HAUS price history is viewable on Coingeckohttpswwwcoingeckocomencoinsdaohaus

March 29 2021 was the first time there was publicly available HAUS liquidity The initial price at that point was 888 There was an immediate runup just prior to Coingecko beginning to track the price

 Enabling easier access to HAUS for DAOs and individuals wishing to participate in DAOhaus governance activities
 Facilitating DAOhaus ecosystem grants denominated in HAUS by increasing the relative stability of the HAUS price
 Facilitating upcoming utilization of HAUS as a coordination mechanism beyond voting within the DAOhaus ecosystem also related to price stability
 Supporting the utility and value of DAOhaus contributor compensation denominated in HAUS

 Specifications

 Governance

See Governance section under Protocol Description above

 Oracles

The DAOhaus platform does not rely on any external oracles

 Audits

The most used smart contracts in the DAOhaus platform are instances of the MolochV21 contract frameworkhttpsgithubcomHausDAOMolochv21 V21 makes only a small adjustment to the V2 contracthttpsgithubcomMolochVenturesmoloch which was audited by Consenys Diligence

None of the contracts used within the DAOhaus platform are upgradable

DAOhaus also makes use of Minion contracts which allow a DAO to interact with external contracts and control external vaults The predominant version is the Safe Minion contracthttpsgithubcomHausDAOMinionSummonerV2 which acts as middleware between the DAO contract and a Gnosis Safe where all the funds are stored and external contract interactions are executed

There have been no hacks of DAOhaus smart contracts to date

 MolochV2 audit reporthttpsconsensysnetdiligenceaudits202001thelao by Consensys Diligence

 Centralization vectors

DAOhaus takes decentralization seriously and has made several organizational design choices to avoid concentrating power As a result the current state of DAOhaus is reasonably decentralized

 None of the DAOhaus contracts are upgradable
 Governance power over key onchain assets is distributed across multiple entities each of which is a DAO of its own For example DAOhaus core contributors Warcamp is a 30person DAO with distributed governance powers
 Noncirculating HAUS is controlled by UberHaus the DAO of DAOs No DAO in UberHaus controls more than 105 of voting shares and there is no path by which a DAO could gain additional voting shares without permission from a majority of peer DAOs

The largest centralization vector is our front end hosting over which a handful of developers have admin control However while an attack on the front end could manipulate what users see the onchain contracts readable and writable via block explorers remain the source of truth for all key user assets

Our goal is to migrate our entire stack to decentralized infrastructure

Summary

Stader proposes adding a gauge for the MaticMaticX pool on Balancer MaticX is a liquid token for Matic staking built by StaderLabs a multichain staking infrastructure provider with 770 mn  in TVL The incentivization of the MaticMaticX pool on Balancer will help

1 Build deep liquidity would be a prerequisite to make staked Matic truly liquid in the Polygon Defi ecosystem and incentives would be an important mechanism to aid this
2 Establish Balancer as the prime DEX for Matic  MaticX pool Two reasons why this is important
  1 3 bn in assets locked in polygon staking currently that is set to be unlocked by liquid staking solutions like MaticX
  2 With its metastable pool technology Balancer is best placed to serve Matic  MaticX

Protocol description

Background on Staderlabs

StaderLabs is a multichain staking infrastructure provider We are live on 4 blockchains including Terra Polygon Fantom and Hedera

Within a few months of launch Stader has more than 770 Mn USD of total assets staking on the platform

1  700 M Luna staked
2 60 M HBAR staked
3 Over 40k users staking with Stader smart contracts

Stader Protocols native token is the SD Token and we have incentivized liquidity pools on other DEXes by giving out rewards in SD tokens listed on coin gecko 

About MaticX

MaticX is a liquid token that users get when they stake their Matic with Stader The MaticX tokens are a representation of users staked Matic They allow users to swap them at a later date for their staked Matic and accrued rewards with Stader Meanwhile they will be able to use it on multiple protocols on Polygon to participate in DeFi MaticX is an ERC20 token

Safety and security are paramount for Stader and we do multiple audits of our smart contracts to safeguard users funds MaticX contracts have been audited successfully by two reputed audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes 

Motivation

Adding incentivization to the MaticMaticX pool on Balancer will help unlock the large liquidity currently locked in staked Matic for the Polygon and Balancer community and in the process bring significant liquidity and trading volumes to the Balancer ecosystem

 Liquid staking is large and MaticX aims to be the primary liquid staking token for Polygon
   Staking on polygon currently has 3bn  of assets staked Liquid staking can help unlock a large part of this for use in the Defi ecosystem making this an asset class of interest to the Polygon and Balancer communities
   Staders experience in building strong liquid staking solutions on multiple chains especially Terra and Hedera with 770 mn in TVL makes it one of the leading candidates to help unlock this liquidity through MaticX
   MaticX is off to a strong start within a few weeks of launch with staking TVL for Matic already at 25 Million Matic We also recently launched staking on the Polygon Mainnet directly Polygons staking protocol is native to Ethereum so Stader Polygon v1 only supported staking Matic on Ethereum and this will help increase staking penetration and in turn MaticX
   We will build deep liquidity for MaticX to truly enable users to unlock their staked assets and participate in Defi on Polygon The MaticX  Matic LP is already live on Quickswap and has a liquidity of around 5 million USD with average daily trading volume of 246333 in the last 7 days Apr 27May 3
   We expect MaticX to continue to grow in demand as we integrate across more ecosystem partners and also increase overall staking participation in Polygon currently only 14000 wallets of total of 140m active wallets stake on Polygon
 Balancer is best suited to provide deep liquidity for MaticMaticX given its unique metastable pool technology a great fit for liquid staking assets

title Proposal Whitelist the Aave Mainnet Reserve Factor for Balancers VoteEscrow
status Proposed
author Matthew_Graham Llama
created 23042022



 Summary

The proposal aims to add Aave DAOs Reserve Factor address to the Balancer VotingEscrow whitelist This will enable the Aave Community to votelock BAL B80BAL20WETH and participate in Balancer DAOs governance 1

 Abstract

Llama has published proposals on the Aave DAO and Balancer DAO governance forum for both communities to perform a 200000 BAL for AAVE tokenswap 234 Upon completing this tokenswap Aave intends to deposit BAL and ETH into the B80BAL20WETH pool This proposal is to enable Aave to votelock BAL B8020 BALETH and become an active contributor within the Balancer governance process

 Motivation

Aave and Balancer communities have a long working relationship Aave has incorporated the 8020 AAVEETH Balancer V1 BPT into the Safety Module and intends to upgrade to using a Balancer V2 pool in time Meanwhile Balancers USDCDAIUSDT Boosted Pool uses Aave V2 in the background as a source of yield for liquidity providers Both communities have demonstrated the ability to work together and create value for each others community The tokenswap is the next logical step in creating an ever stronger relationship

At the time of writing the Aave mainnet Reserve Factor holds 1924 aBAL and this will become around 201924 BAL post tokenswap 25 If the Aave community elects to proceed with an onmarket purchase of 100000 BAL the total BAL holding will become 301924 and Aave will become one of the Top 30 holders 67 Aave intends to use the veBAL holding to actively participate in Balancers governance process and to support the pools that lead to funds being deposited into Aave markets andor Safety Module

 Risks

No significant risks have been identified in connection with the proposed transaction

 Motivation

The Emergency DAOhttpsdaocurvefiemergencymembers is an idea pioneered by Curve that empowers a small group to kill pools and gauges in the event of malicious activity andor potential loss of funds So far the power has only been used once to kill the Mochi poolhttpsgovcurvefitthecurveemergencydaohaskilledtheusdmgauge2307

This proposal is being presented as a response to the situation Balancer is facing regarding the three element pools 1httpsappelementfipools0xEdf085f65b4F6c155e13155502Ef925c9a756003actionredeem2httpsappelementfipools0x4bd6D86dEBdB9F5413e631Ad386c4427DC9D01B2actionredeem3httpsappelementfipools0x7Edde0CB05ED19e03A9a47CD5E53fC57FDe1c80cactionredeem which were grandfathered into the gauge voting system when veBAL launched A single LP has staked in the gauges and has bribed on hidden hand to entice voters while this single actor collects all the emissions

Given that these element pools have expired they should no longer be eligible for BAL emissions

The Emergency subDAO will be a 4of7 multisig with the following members

A governance proposal will be required to change signers of this multisig To be clear Balancers Emergency subDAO will only have the power to kill gauges Balancer pools cannot be killed by governance after the pool factory has been deployed for three months

An additional power of the Emergency subDAO will be to add a token to the deny list on the newly created ProtocolFeesWithdrawerhttpsforumbalancerfitintroduceprotocolfeeswithdrawer3188 contract In order for a token to be added back to the allow list a veBAL governance vote would be required A token would only be added to the deny list in the event of an issue along the lines of the recent Synthetix bug disclosurehttpsforumbalancerfitmediumseveritybugfound3161

Pickle Finance2 aims to become the home for Balancer LPs to enjoy the best possible returns and to become a major collaborator in the governance of the Balancer Protocol 

 Abstract

Pickle is building a module on top of Balancers Gauge system that seeks to aid Balancer LPs and prospective veBAL participants in maximising the utility of their deposits with Balancer while also enhancing the overall utility of the Balancers Gauge system by creating a liquid veBAL derivative

Similar to other boosting protocols Pickle aims to create these synergies by providing an easy mechanism for the aggregation of veBAL boosts and for prospective Balancer LPs to benefit from this boost

The Pickle and Balancer teams are no strangers to each other with Pickle being invited and expressing its willingness to join the Balancer Wars as early as the Gauge system was announced Pickle has borrowed from its unique experience running a Gauge system for itself and building on top of other boosting modules like Convex to come up with a unique system we call the Brinery 

As a gesture of goodwill and to encourage the creation and adoption of the Balancer Brinery Pickle will be providing incentives in PICKLE tokens to both those who vote to whitelist us and those who join the Brinery early on These incentives will be detailed pending their approval by Pickle governance The Balancer community can expect the Pickle Core team to propose between 23 of the PICKLE supply to be awarded to Balancer Brinery incentives with rougly 80 of these reserved for joiners and 20 for voters

This proposal makes no request to the Balancer community for financial assistance to Pickle We are a solvent revenuegenerating protocol with a healthy balance sheet Our interest is in providing a superior service to Balancer users and to create a symbiotic relationship between our communities

 Brinery Specification Architecture  Design

The Brinery will provide a seamless experience for users to join veBAL Our proposed system works in the following manner 
1 Users deposit 8020 BALETH BPT with Pickle
2 Users receive brinBAL in return
3 Under the hood Pickle will
  a Lock up a portion of BALETH for veBAL in perpetuity  a receipt token is issued for the locked amount as pveBAL A portion of BALETH liquidity is retained
  b Supply pveBAL and retained BALETH into a new Balancer pool
4 Users can redeem brinBAL for their proportionate share of pveBAL and BALETH or in a single asset if they wish

This design has the advantage of guaranteeing liquidity for Pickles veBAL derivative The Brinery contracts will have flexibility in managing liquidity to achieve the proper balance between liquidity and maximal rewards Users who hold brinBAL will receive Balancer governance rewards all feesharing rewards emissions and bribe proceeds will be consolidated into BAL tokens the Brinerys flywheel rewards BAL taxed from Brinery boosted PickleJars and of course PICKLE tokens 

For users familiar with our standard PickleJar a series of Brinery Boosted Jars or brinJars will be on offer to compound users BPT positions taking advantage of boosted rewards from the Brinerys veBAL lock alongside PICKLE incentives These novel Balancer Jars will rely on stateoftheart infrastructure and comply with the EIP4626 standard for maximal efficiency security and composability 

 Pickle

 History

Pickle is one of the original yield aggregators in DeFi bringing innovations such as incentivised autofarming with its PickleJars We have been building as an Ethereumbased DAO since September 2020 Our builders are wellknown and have collaborated over their time in DeFi with many topnotch protocols and teams to build conduct security reviews or brainstorm and validate ideas To name a few Yearn Sushi Curve Polygon Frax Alchemix and of course Balancer

Pickle has crossed paths with Balancer on several occasions Pickle was the first yield aggregator to build on top of Balancer on its launch in Polygon Moreover our PICKLEETH was only the second pool after BALETH to launch with Balancer on Arbitrum A cursory look at the BAL mining scripts on GitHub1 shows we are 1 of 11 Balancer partners On Arbitrum we are 1 of 3 We are brethren in DeFi and hope to remain so for many years to come

Finally Pickle was the firstever protocol to adapt Curves Gauge system to align its users and token holders into a better governance system we call DILL More than 51 of all PICKLE is currently locked for an average of 323 years with almost 1000 DILL holders forming the DAO that backs our protocol

 Team

Pickle is led by myself joined by the rest of the core team which currently consists of another 12 individuals with a wide range of skills in product product marketing UX design smart contracts engineering and frontend and Web3 infrastructure development 

 Governance

Pickle is run according to the principle of progressive decentralisation by the DILL DAO DILL governance is currently upgrading so DILL holders receive 100 of protocol revenues generated by Pickle in ETH plus PICKLE antidilutive rewards At present using Pickles Gauge system DILL holders can vote onchain for where PICKLE emissions should go With support for delegation currently in development Pickle aims to launch its own Pickle voting module so users can participate in governance including PICKLE emission allocations across sidechains via secure offchain voting

The Pickle voting module to provide DILL holders an interface for directing veBAL voting power held by Pickles Balancer Brinery as well as select the allocation of PICKLE emissions amongst our various Brinery products

 I Introduction

This proposal aims to outline how the funding and accountability process will work for any entity wishing to contribute to the Balancer ecosystem To recap the journey so far in early 2022 subDAOs were formedhttpsvotebalancerfiproposal0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66 to give community contributors a formalized structure with clearly defined domains More recently the DAO has chosen to incorporate a foundationhttpssnapshotorgbalancerethproposal0x357877d9d3d121e929f66cad2349987fc658be449585f8d021319b69a3a0e620 in order to engage with service providers who require formal contracts

This framework aims to deliver the following benefits

 Streamlined process for funding service providers
 Clear and decentralized accountability mechanisms
 Creation of a delegate system to enable a transparent dialogue between proposers and large token holders

 II Process for Funding Service Providers

A service provider SP is an entity with a budget attached to it managed by one or more Leaders that coordinate and pay contributors working to achieve one or more long term goals in the Balancer Ecosystem When choosing to pursue funding as a SP or through the Grants program a rough guideline is short term or one off engagements requiring 100k or less should go through Grants A longer term engagement or one with a cost beyond 100k should be pursued as a SP

To keep things simple the terms service provider working group and subDAO are considered synonyms and interchangeable A SP can be an incorporated legal entity or simply a loosely organized group of anonymous Balancer contributors In order to interface with the Foundation a legal agreement is required so any SP taking advantage of the Foundation must be a legal entity or a natural person

SPs have an option to make their funding proposal through the Foundation If it is made through the Foundation the Foundation will create the funding proposal on the forum on behalf of the SP The SP is expected to answer any community questions or concerns raised on the forum Funding will be distributed to the Foundations wallet on a quarterly basis and from there distributed to the SP on a defined monthly basis If the SP does not go through the Foundation then funding will be distributed directly to the SP on a quarterly basis

All funding proposals must include Domains of Operation and Key Objectives

 II1 Domains of Operation

Examples of Domains might be core protocol development partner integrations marketing business development front end community etc While some overlap is acceptable multiple SPs operating in the same Domains it is generally not an effective use of DAO funds to have multiple marketing teams or multiple teams managing the community for example Clearly indicating Domains of Operation and the expertise an SP brings to that Domain will reduce inefficient overlap and help to increase coordination in the event of necessary or useful overlap Having multiple SPs building front ends might represent a useful overlap for example

Each SP should make clear how they will handle record keeping and the handover of those records in the event they are offboarded If an SP proposes to enter a domain of operation already occupied by another approved SP the proposal should outline how they plan to coordinate efforts to avoid the DAO paying double for the same work It is expected that the work product of each SP is made available to the community on a regular basis

 II2 Key Objectives

Key Objectives should be high level goals the SP plans to work towards and accomplish during the funding period If appropriate these might be broken down into a list of specific tasks It is important that the DAO have a clear idea of what the SP is doing while also leaving enough flexibility for innovation and efficiency Providing success metrics will also ensure the community can easily evaluate performance

Finally a brief overview of how the funds would be spent is the last requirement In the event of an SP requiring additional funds before the end of the funding period a supplemental budget request can be made in the same format as a regular funding request An estimate of the SPs monthly spend should be included which will be used to calculate the quarterly distribution of funds

All SPs going through the Foundation must upload a copy of their Service Level Agreement or SLA to ipfs and include the link in their funding proposal

 III Accountability Mechanisms

We must ensure any funds disbursed from the DAO treasury are used transparently and in service of the Balancer Ecosystem Ultimately veBAL holders are responsible for ensuring SPs are delivering enough value to justify the cost of funding them We propose the following rules for holding SPs accountable

 All SPs must hold monthly community calls in any online venue of their choosing as long as it is open to the public Failure to hold a monthly call will prevent the Foundation or the DAO from disbursing future funds The recordings of these community calls must stay available for at least 3 months after the community call has wrapped up
 In combination with the monthly community call a monthly summary must also be created which details progress towards each Key Objective outlined by the SP in their funding proposal This should be posted to Balancers forum in advance of the monthly community call
 Anyone can make a forum proposal to the DAO to stop the FoundationDAO from disbursing future funds to the SP Such a proposal should include SP in question reason to halt funding supporting evidence and any other comments
 If the vote passes all future funding to that SP will be halted until a new funding proposal is successfully approved If it fails funding continues as normal
 There will be an internal monthly meeting with mandatory attendance by at least one representative of every actively funded SP The goal of this meeting is to ensure all SPs are strategically aligned across the ecosystem Ideally each SP should keep their representative the same month to month

Every member of Balancers community shares responsibility for ensuring SPs that receive funding from the treasury are acting in the best interest of the Balancer ecosystem The rules outlined above empower every community member to act if they feel an SP is no longer acting in that best interest The Foundation is an agent of the DAO and must honor the outcome of any legitimate snapshot vote subject to any applicable LawsActs and Regulations

 V Delegate System

While anyone can initiate a proposal to stop funding a SP it is large veBAL holders who have the strongest incentive to ensure SPs are delivering value The creation of a delegate system will lead to a more transparent and productive dialogue between proposers and those with large voting power We encourage anyone interested in being a delegate to present their platform to the community in the new Delegate Citadelhttpsforumbalancerficdelegatecitadel14 section of the forum

 VI Voting

Delegates and token holders should not vote in favor to fund or against to defund a SP that they are working for or affiliated with Additionally SPs should not compensate token holders monetarily in exchange for their votes do not bribe on funding or defunding proposals

There will be a third voting option added to snapshot to cover the case of a SP being affiliated with many large veBAL holders and thus failing to pass a proposal to fund them because so much voting power cannot vote in good faith For each SP funding proposal there will be Yes No and Abstain It is expected that delegates and any token holders with a potential conflict of interest regarding a particular SP will only vote for Abstain if they choose to vote at all and provide the reason for doing so

 VII Risk Assessment

There are various risks to the ecosystem that could arise from the adoption of this proposal

 A veBAL token holder might work for a SP or the SP might have holdings of veBAL itself and vote in favor of funding the SP despite this conflict of interest
 A SP might get funded and not follow through on their key objectives With funds sent on a quarterly basis this could result in a sizable loss of funds
 Balancer sees multiple SP funding requests and if all were funded this would represent an unsustainable burn rate

The way to mitigate these risks is to foster an active and engaged community Conflicts of interest should be declared up front to prevent any appearance of impropriety Unknown or new SPs might want to request a lower funding amount andor utilize milestone based payments as a trial period If milestone based payments are utilized they should be overseen by the Grants Service Provider Delegates and those community members who handle management of treasury funds should speak up about the impact funding SPs will have on the treasury  and it is a good idea for each SP to include their assessment of that impact in their proposal if they can

The responsibility for stewarding the Balancer ecosystem towards a bright future lies with veBAL holders and delegates We could try to create many rules to address many possible scenarios but we see value in creating a simple and flexible framework for funding all kinds of Balancer contributors

324," Motivation

Balancer recently launchedhttpsopbeetsfipools on Optimism in collaboration with BeethovenX This deployment will soon utilize veBAL gauges for BAL emissions so it is important that BAL maintains adequate liquidity and price equivalence with Ethereum To get around the 7 day withdrawal period on the official Optimism bridge which breaks the necessary arbitrage loop with Ethereum I have enlisted the help of Multichainhttpsmultichainxyz They have added support for BAL between Ethereum and Optimism however it requires liquidity to be functionalhttpsdocsmultichainorgforpartnersforpartnersfaq

Thus I propose allocating BAL from the treasury for this purpose Please see the poll at the bottom which will serve as a temp check on the amount Note that we would earn bridge feeshttpsmediumcommultichainorganyswapfeesexplainedbceddf535b83 on any funds deposited for bridge liquidity

The treasury currently holds 4M BALhttpsgnosissafeioappeth0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4fbalances so you can calculate the impact to the treasury from there depending on your poll choice

 Risk

 Multichain is exploited and our BAL is lost You can find information about their security model herehttpsdocsmultichainorggettingstartedsecuritysecuritymodel

 Users only bridge in one direction ie Optimism Ethereum and instead use the official bridge for Ethereum Optimism This would see bridge liquidity on one side drained and we would be unable to withdraw our BAL until this was resolved somehow

 Specification

If approved 40000 BAL would be sent from the DAO Multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f to the LM Multisig 0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 and deposited 5050 on both sides of the bridge",18.259745386468335
325," Motivation

As some have noticed the CREAMWETH gaugehttpsforumbalancerfitcreamweth8020gauge3165 we recently approved has been allocated over 40 of BAL emissions In concert with that the swap fee on the pool has been set to 10 This has exposed a hole in our gauge requirements that should be remedied for all past and future gauges By setting the swap fee to 10 they are attempting to prevent trading in the pool in order to passively farm BAL rewards 

 For each gauge the underlying pools owner must be set to Balancer Governance If this is not the case a very good reason must be presented in the gauge proposal

 If Balancer Governance is not the owner any proposed change to the swap fee must be communicated to Balancers community in the swapfeeandamplification channel in Balancers discord This must be done at least 24h in advance of the change being made and the change can only be made if the Ballers Balancer community contributors are in favor

Failure to adhere to these guidelines for existing gauges where the owner is not Balancer Governance will open the possibility for the Emergency subDAOhttpsforumbalancerfitformtheemergencysubdao3197 to kill the gauge at their discretion if they believe the swap fee change to be malicious causing liquidity to be unusable 

 Risk

 The actors performing these malicious actions together likely have enough voting power to vote down this proposal on snapshot If they do that I would petition the Emergency subDAO to kill the gauge and classify this as a governance attack Up to the other six members if they agree with that assessment or not 

 Specification

If approved the above guidelines will immediately and retroactively go into effect Due to the time sensitive nature the vote will likely begin later today but discussion can and should continue while the vote is ongoing",18.265199043118024
326,"Hi everyone

As most of you are aware the Tribe DAO has applied for a veBAL allowlisting last monthhttpsforumbalancerfitproposalallowtribedaotolockvebal2888 that was granted by the Balancer DAO and 112041 B80BAL20WETH tokens were successfully locked into veBAL last month

The Tribe DAO also owns 252865 B70WETH30FEI BPTs a pool token that has a gauge and we staked the BPTs in the gauge earning BAL for around 3 weeks

Contract used for votelocking and gauge staking 

httpsetherscanioaddress0xc4EAc760C2C631eE0b064E39888b89158ff808B2

During our periodic reward harvesting 2 weeks ago we noticed that our contract could not claim the BAL rewards associated with gauge staking only the BAL and bbaUSD associated with veBAL holding

After discussion with the Balancer team the issue was identified  BAL is not distributed through the gauge system but through a BalancerMinter contract that is connected to the gauge system The Tribe devs did a mistake as we wanted to reuse the voting escrow and gauge management contracts we used for Angle Protocol but it turns out that Angle Protocol distributes their ANGLE differently directly through the gauges and not through a minter like Curve and Balancer so we did not have any capability to interact with the BalancerMinter We tested and successfully claimed empty rewards on the gauge without revert but just assumed no BAL were distributed because the gauge weight of the FEI pool was zero

The Tribe DAOs votelocker has been deployed as an immutable contract and it is now impossible to add the capability to interact with the BalancerMinter and claim the BAL rewards associated with gaugestaked BPTs

As a result the Tribe DAO farmed 34344 BAL that will be forever unclaimable on the BalancerMinter

We would like to ask the Balancer DAO to OTC these BAL tokens back to us on this addresshttpsetherscanioaddress0xc5bb8F0253776beC6FF450c2B40f092f7e7f5b57 We do realize that there is absolutely no obligation to do so on your part and that the mistake was ours but Balancer is a very strategic move for the Tribe DAO even more so with the FEIFRAX partnershiphttpstribefeimoneytfraxxfeistablecoinalliance4292 potentially coming and these BAL will never enter circulation and will forever be unclaimable otherwise The Tribe DAO will continue to renew its veBAL locking from the current contract but we are going to deploy a new gauge staking contract shortlyhttpsgithubcomfeiprotocolfeiprotocolcorepull799 edit  deployed herehttpsetherscanioaddress0xf53e251352683155898295569d77b8506ba00d80 behind eip1967httpsetherscanioaddress0x66977ce30049cd0e443216bf26377966c3a109e2 proxy

 Summary

As a recap on 13 April 2022 a proposalhttpsforumbalancerfitproposalincorporationofthebalancerfoundation2989 was brought to the BalancerDAO or the DAO to incorporate the Balancer Foundation or the Foundation The Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work furthering Balancers decentralization goals and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem

The Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate and provides among others two primary benefits

It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts In addition for example it intends to establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto

It encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity at the direction of the DAO can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol  for example it could engage business development or tech providers

In short the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the BalancerDAO in the structure of the traditional business world

The Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment The Foundation Companies Act in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations

Running a Foundation Company comes with certain realworld costs and financial reserve requirements These are laid out below first in summary and then in detail for reference

 Specification  Foundation Expenses and reserves

This proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters effective April 2022 running through March 2023 and a selfinsurance reserve

 Foundation Expenses

The summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO Each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote If no changes are requested this proposal will serve as the governing decision

The Foundations fiscal year runs January to December so April  May June is the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 although it is the first quarter for which funding is requested

1 Q2 FY22  USDC 32941  actual expenses incurred through the end of May 2022 and forecast for June 2022  immediate payment requested
2 Q3 FY22  USDC 67919  for transfer 25 June 2022
3 Q4 FY22  USDC 67969  for transfer 25 September 2022
4 Q1 FY23  USDC 78384  for transfer 15 December 2022

The table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter Descriptions for each line item are included under the Detail section further below

624x417174903581549uploadvPqyfiEv162ngVFJ64ipxJDv5Iijpeg

 Foundation Self Insurance Reserve

As part of this proposal we are asking BalancerDAO to hold the equivalent of US500000 as a selfinsurance reserve earmarked for a year and to be revisited after a year The reserve can be maintained in BAL tokens given current market conditions but must at all times be available to the Foundation should it be needed and must be maintained at an equivalent value of US500000 More on this reserve requirement can be found in the Detail section below

Note the proposal is for funding at the Balancer Foundation level it does not include funding for

1 Balancer OpCo Limited the British Virgin Islands BVI subsidiary and operating company that will house the frontend development team for BalancerDAO
2 Other thirdparty service providers to the BalancerDAO such as Orb Collective and Kolektivo Labs

Proposals for funding these three entities will follow separately

4 Compliance

 Responsible for all necessary filings responses to inquiries management of AML Compliance vendor and other Cayman Foundation compliance and riskrelated matters

5 and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation

 Legal Counsel

The Foundation may from time to time require advice on matters of Cayman law It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter For clarity this refers to the legal team rather than the corporate services team

 Self Insurance

It is typical for an organization to obtain insurance to protect itself against the legal regulatory and operational risks as well as to protect the directors and officers from personal liability for carrying out their duties We have not seen reasonable insurance for organizations of this nature in the market hence the need to selfinsure

We are asking for 500000 based on the costs of defending Balancer in the event of a regulatory inquiry class action or other lawsuit or vulnerability to the ecosystem The selfinsurance is based on recent DeFi matters within the last 12 months which have cost on average 100000 monthly to defend It is important to note that we have excluded any reserve for payment of damages fines or impact on users

Since this is a reserve and not an expense the Directors may assess in the future that a lower reserve amount becomes sufficient and propose changes to the DAO We are asking that the DAO bookmarks these funds to hold for selfinsurance

 Bank Fees

The Foundation is working to establish a bank relationship that we are advised could take approximately 68 weeks once the application is complete and submitted This line item is an estimateplaceholder for monthly fees

FIAT DAO is seeking the preliminary approval of veBAL gauges for two yettobedeployed stableswap pools

 FIATUSDCDAI
 FIATFEIFRAX

This comes after the successful migration of our governance token FDTs liquidity to the Balancer platform over the past month

Protocol Description
The FIAT protocol is a DeFinative repo market solution for providing liquidity to holders of fixed income assets It allows users of apps like Element Finance Notional Finance and Yield Protocol to bring their proofs of liquidity to the protocol in order to collateralize a debt position in FIAT a stable value asset Our v1 has just launched and itll look and feel familiar for users who have previously minted DAI RAI or MIM By utilizing proven stablecoin mechanisms the protocol is able to offer competitive borrowing power to holders of such collateral assets allowing them to releverage fixed yields or meet current liabilities as the locked assets mature You can learn more about its primary use case via this threadhttpstwittercomwjvillstatus1527680960866705408 from Element founder Will Villanueva

The success of FIAT is predicated on its ability to attract secondary liquidity In its current iteration it is pooling secondary liquidity around a singular asset drawing forward demand for an otherwise fragmented universe of collateral backing Unique to FIAT versus other CDP implementations is that fixed term collateral forces users to repay back their debt at a known point in time lest they bear negative yields due to FIAT interest accrual on those positions thereafter  this allows for higher maximum LTVs and potentially more trading fees for LPs Currently only stablecoindenominated collateral is supported by the protocol so any risk premium is a function of smart contract concerns or changes in prevailing yields

Motivation
Over the course of its first month in existence FIAT has had its liquidity subsidized on Curve via a discretionary budget Over the same time liquidity for our governance token has been ported to Balancer Weve been very pleased with the migration and think it makes sense to follow suit with FIAT here in its early days

A number of items excite us about the opportunity

 The presence of boosted staBAL and now FEIFRAXDAI pools will allow for user pathways that involve depositing into either minting FIAT and selling FIAT for more of the underlying in order to gain levered fixed exposure This results in locked TVL for Balancer and higher trading fees for Balancer LPs

 With Hidden Hand it will become possible to have a larger consortium of projects actively subsidize FIAT LPs We anticipate that all of our collateral partners with associated ERC20 tokens will see the value in deeper FIAT liquidity for their protocols And for other stableswap pools that exist on Balancer deeper FIAT liquidity increases the odds of locked TVL in their pools

 The user experience associated with veBAL and Hidden Hand is more clear than our current Curve  Rari Fuse flow

What we would like to discuss in this thread however is the deployment of the stableswap pools themselves Given the nature of FIAT ie CDP architecture stablecoin backing audited collateral issuers we would be interested to hear what members of the Balancer DAO have to say regarding their comfort with varying levels of potential A coefficientshttpsdocsbalancerficonceptsmathstablemath If you have any specific thoughts regarding this topic please share your opinion in the thread

Specifications

1 Governance FIAT DAO is a completely onchain organization with no corresponding real world entity in place The FDT token has been given away for free since November of 2021 and a DAO smart contract architecture has been live since December 2021

2 Oracles FDT is a standard ERC20 DeFi governance token that comes with the volatility inherent to the sector FIAT is a DAIlike asset that will come to be backed by less liquid derivatives but at the moment only supports collateral types with existing secondary markets

3 Audits Audits of our protocol and our collateral oracle system can be found in the Securityhttpsgithubcomfiatdaosecurity repo within our Github

4 Centralization Vectors FDT holders determine which assets are supported as collateral and the parameters associated with each A six of eleven guardian multisig currently holds certain emergency privileges

5 Market History FIAT has been transferable since April 2022 It previously reached a high watermark of 13M deposited on Curve

We would like to take this to a vote now that the FUD pool is live

On April 18th the funding of the Balancer DAO for Q2 was ratified 1httpssnapshotorgbalancerethproposal0xe05bc1a898797cd8f78f86bed25bac84efade2df1a959daee09f8dd7c69d3b36 As part of the proposal 21250 BAL and 127500 USDC was requested for contributor compensation With the recent market downturn the ops multisig does not have sufficient BAL to pay the expected June Balaries See here how discounted veBAL compensation is calculated 2httpsbalancergrantsnotionsiteCompensationcb303e0241d94d96bed110929947029d  The proposal is to

 ops subDAO Multisig 3httpsetherscanioaddress0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325tokentxns swaps its remaining USDC expected to be 76892 USDC after USDC Balaries for June with the treasury for the additional BAL required to pay out June Balaries in BAL expected to be 22805 BAL  This amount of BAL was calculated based on a BAL price of 366 on June 18th After June has commenced the remaining BAL in the ops subDAO multisig will be sent back to treasury

 Motivation

Preservation of USDC available for the Balancer DAO can be the prudent choice in the current market conditions Therefore a swap of BAL from the DAO treasury  USDC from the ops subDAO Multisig  with the Balancer DAO treasury would retain USDC on the DAOs balance sheet and manage to pay the Balaries for June for people who are looking to get their Balary as discounted veBAL

 Risks if applicable

 While the ops subDAO made best efforts to poll contributors for their expected Balary the official determination will happen at the end of the month via our monthly healthcheck
 BAL price falls below 366 by the end of the month and a new proposal needs to be voted on to request the additional BAL due to the decreased price of BAL

 Domains of Operation

Multisig Management

 Linear boosted pool settings
 Swap fee and amplification adjustments
 Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL
 Adding new reward tokens to gauges
 Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees
 Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig

Expertise Besides setting swap fees this group has done all these tasks from day 1 Soon after we took control of swap fees from our friends at Gauntlet the protocol broke the previous record of 24h fees earned We believe our track record justifies our continued management of these multisigs until such time as governance approves another SP to take them over

Governance

 We serve on the Governance Councilhttpsforumbalancerfitproposalgovernanceprocessrevamp2324 and ensure continuity of Balancers Governance Process
 Active participants in discord and the forum on governance topics
 Several of us are delegateshttpsforumbalancerficdelegatecitadel14
 Advise projects on Balancers governance process
 Manage admin of the Governance forum
 We will pursue various strategic initiatives either individually or as a group at our discretion such as deploying to Optimism or the new Operating Framework
 In the cases that voting power in other protocols from tokens held in Balancers Treasury has been delegated to us we will represent Balancers interest in these votes

Expertise We helped to design Balancers governance system and are very active users of it It is safe to say our group has the strongest working knowledge of Balancers governance system outside of Balancer Labs For now it does require active management to ensure votes are carried out in an orderly fashion then properly executed We believe our track record here again speaks for itself and we will continue to operate in the same fashion we have been until governance approves a new governance framework or approves another SP to take these tasks over

Userproject support

 We manage Balancers discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed
 Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions
 We often deploy new pools for other projects
 Whitelisting and maintaining token lists
 We help with UI testing for Balancer

Expertise If you come to discord well likely be the ones helping you out We are also spread out in many chats with projects offering advice and performing routine necessary tasks as described above It is safe to say almost all projects that have used Balancer over the last year have spoken to one of us at some point We will continue to operate in this support capacity and offer any assistance we can to the community and the efforts of other SPs

Community

 We manage a Coordinape circle open to all DAO contributors
 Onboarding framework for new contributors
 Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO or between SPs
 Regular healthcheck on SP and community contributors with recurrent feedback

Expertise These initiatives were pioneered by some of our members over the last six months We will continue iterating and exploring these both with our in house knowledge but also in collaboration with the broader community

Record Keeping

 We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded
 Maintaining updating and improving official Balancer documentation as a bridge between the greater community and core development team

 Key Objectives  Success Metrics

Multisig Management

 Transactions are vetted for accuracy and executed in a timely manner
 Public discord channels are used for swap fee discussion so the community can provide input and feedback

Governance

 Balancers Governance system continues to operate in a fair and transparent manner
 We will continue being very active participants and leaders

Userproject support

 Discordtelegram chat questions will be answered in a timely manner

Community

 Coordinape will pay out promptly each month
 We will act as a touch point for any interested contributors to Balancer DAO

Global

 We commit to undertake all activities in public where reasonable We aim to responsibly grow the Balancer Maxis and this can only be done when the community is able to interact and engage with us There must be more opportunities for this in the future
 We will continue to facilitate the weekly Treasury meeting Tuesday 11am EST in discord open to the public This is a good opportunity for anyone in the community to talk to us about the Treasury or any other relevant topic
 We will facilitate a monthly community call where all SPs are welcome to join for their monthly updates This eases the burden on the community to attend many calls Again optional participation by other SPs

 Length of Engagement  Budget

3 months

Budget of 6875 BAL per month for salaries 1250 per person Danko at 625 which will be max locked in veBAL by contributors Additional monthly allocations of 100 BAL for gas costs and 4000 BAL for Coordinape

Total for 3 month engagement 32925 BAL

Impact on the Treasury The Treasury currently holds 4M BAL Funding the Balancer Maxis would cost less than 1 of the treasurys BAL holdings

Per recent discussionhttpsforumbalancerfitdiscussionkillcreamwethgauge3396 on the forum the community is split on this issue Governance did approve the CREAM gauge in a legitimate vote and BAL was bought on the open market and locked in veBAL to vote for it Governance also has the power to vote to kill any gauge for any reason and everyone participating in veBAL accepts these are the rules

The Balancer ecosystem has significant funding requirements that currently far exceed our revenue generation based on the last 30 days At this point in time the largest blocker to Balancer reaching sustainability is the existence of the CREAM gauge There is enough support in the community for killing the gauge that it is appropriate to move this to a vote in my view  this proposal will be sent to the Governance Council for approval next Thursday July 14th

Introduction  Domains of Operation

Since becoming a Friendly Forkhttpsvotebalancerfiproposal0x95db8e797145ad590b467f8dbecb23404c25c2a7090aa8a8d65428ad9f7373fc Beethoven X and Balancer have developed a strong working relationship marked by the successful launch of a joint venture on Optimismhttpssnapshotorgbalancerethproposal0xd281d8cad43c97814b2496270498c4396b16c0f2ce522d5bc554aae9fed4e4d7

Throughout this collaboration it has become clear that there is a significant amount of overlap in the work being done on both sides and there is an opportunity to streamline efforts Recognizing this both Balancer and Beethoven X have continually expressed a desire to work closer together

In an effort to accelerate the collaboration Balancer Labs engaged Beethoven X contributors in a 3month trial contract beginning on February 1 2023 This collaboration has allowed both teams to leverage each others strengths and work together to drive technical innovation for the Balancer DAO

As Balancer pursues its path towards further decentralization we believe the inclusion of the Beethoven X DAO in its pool of service providers would represent a significant step in furthering this goal

In this proposal we will provide an update on the progress of the collaboration and present our plans for the future We believe that by working collaboratively we can achieve greater efficiency and drive innovation for the benefit of the entire Balancer ecosystem

Balancer API

Beethoven X launched a custom UI in August 2022 with the goal of providing a fast and smooth user experience To facilitate this goal a significant amount of energy and resources were invested into the development of a custom backend API

httpsgithubcombeethovenxfibeethovenxbackendhttpsgithubcombeethovenxfibeethovenxbackend

While OpCo has also been in the process of developing their own API it was recognized that the Beethoven X API is in a more mature state and both sides would benefit from collectively supporting and building on a single API moving forward Over the last two months members from OpCo Balancer Labs and Beethoven X have worked collaboratively to deploy a joint API infrastructure that will service both Balancer and Beethoven X moving forward

httpsapiv3balancerfihttpsapiv3balancerfi

OpCo has started the process of integrating the API into the Balancer UI which should serve to provide a smoother UX in many ways The success of this project speaks to the collaborative nature of all teams involved

Scaffoldbalancer

As part of the roadmap planning for Q1 of 2023 Beethoven X contributors proposed the development of a suite of tools that could make it significantly easier to start developing a custom pool contract on top of the Balancer protocol

httpsgithubcombalancerscaffoldbalancerhttpsgithubcombalancerscaffoldbalancer

Scaffoldbalancer is a fork of the well known scaffoldeth project geared specifically around facilitating the rapid prototyping of new Balancer pool types We strongly believe that if we make it simple to get started and succeed early it will provide developers the motivation and inspiration to slowly peel back the layers of complexity that is the Balancer protocol and develop something truly innovative

Current feature set

 Generic Pool UI  Allows you to interact with any existing or locally deployed pool contracts making the timetotest significantly shorter The UI focuses on single contract actions swapjoinexit for both query and tx submission
 SOR Playground  Provides granular config on the pools tokens types etc that are included into the routing The idea being that you can provide tight constraints around the dataset to see how your custom pool performs when benchmarked against existing liquidity although it could also quite easily be used to benchmark the performance of the SOR generally
 Batchswap builder  A UI for building arbitrarily complex batch swaps

Beyond the initially developed feature set João from Orb integrations has also started to build out managed pool controller examples inside scaffoldbalancerhttpsforumbalancerfitorbcollectivemarch2023integrationsupdate4613

While still in its infancy we believe this tool already provides significant value to developers looking to start the journey of developing their own custom pool on Balancer

SDK  SOR

The existing SOR was built before the widespread adoption of BigInt math and the advent of boosted pools As the number of deployed pools has continued to grow the existing SOR has come up against performance limitations Mike McDonald recently initiated a project to rewrite the SOR with a focus on speed and performance Weve supported Mike in this process including implementing a novel graph traversal algorithm for path finding that is boosted pool native

httpsgithubcombalancerbsdkhttpsgithubcombalancerbsdk

The implementation of a robust API has presented an opportunity to rethink the role that the Balancer SDK should fill This repo will become the home of the new Balancer SDK

Technical Advisor

While I daniel am a builder at heart Ive worked in senior developer and CTO roles for the better part of 10 years and have worked professionally as a software developer for 15 years The Balancer Labs leadership has been incredibly open and allowed me to begin to play a larger role across the entire ecosystem Over the last several months Ive started attending regular ecosystem meetings engaged in conversations on product development participated in partnership discussions and taken a role in helping to collaboratively define the future of the Balancer SDK

Marketing content and design

Over the past 18 months the Beethoven X marketing team have established a brand that has come to be recognised for not only its unique personality but its approach to community building and content creation Our goal has been to build a competent community of engaged users that are as passionate about our ecosystem as we are

The focus for our marketing efforts has been centered around producing high quality educational material on the underlying technology as well as cultivating an ethos of care and compassion for our community Combining a strong visual aesthetic with an approachable brand identity has allowed our content voice and style to flourish and has cemented our place as one of the top DeFi protocols on Fantom and Optimism

Weekly newsletters threads docs NFTs giveaways community competitions animations long form articles ambassador programs live events and financial reporting has enabled community members to keep up to date with the Beethoven X ecosystem

Building from a foundation of innovation that intertwines within current trends social narratives and symbiosis offers the opportunity to establish a flourishing community base that is educated and empowered to engage in the ecosystem

While not part of the original agreement we set forth to showcase this competency For the past 3 months the marketing team has started to work on the following initiatives

As part of the roadmap planning for Q1 2023 Beethoven X contributors proposed the development of a landing page that clearly concisely and with strong visuals answers the question that is at the center of the growth of Balancer as a platform Why should I build on Balancer To date 10 indepth interviews have been performed with developers and key contributors across the Balancer ecosystem and work has begun on developing a cohesive storyline The landing page will intertwine strong visual design with technical information to create an engaging experience that highlights what sets Balancer apart

Social Media  Design

Beethoven X contributors have started developing a framework for the evolution of the Balancer social media presence The goal is to create a strong visual identity that not only showcases the technical capabilities of Balancer but also embodies a compelling personality that leverages current trends and social narratives similar to what we strive for with the Beethoven X brand

Content Creation

Beethoven X contributors have started producing in depth twitter threads on relevant topics in the Balancer ecosystem

Key Objectives  Success Metrics 

 Make it easier to build on Balancer  Having become domain experts on Balancer tech Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack
 Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem  A joint API deployment is the first of several projects we see where Beethoven X contributors can leverage their domain expertise to reduce duplicate effort How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today
 Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol  We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision How do we put a true focus on this goal How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol

Our strategy for Balancer marketing would be to highlight the major benefits of Balancer protocol across its user demographics in an engaging informative manner The focus of this strategy would be to educate users on product innovation current trends and partnership developments Coupled with engaging design  visuals the strategy stands to bring Balancer back into the limelight on social media and hopefully ignite a flywheel for growth based on relevancy product and community

Balancer has never been more successful than it is today and we would strive to complement its immense success

In this regard there are 2 key focuses

 Brand Development  Encapture the core brand values and inspire Although a reputable figure there is room to create an inspirational brand aesthetic that speaks well to current trends in a timeless tasteful fashion
 Social Presence  Building from a foundation of insightful content and leveraging an unique aesthetic social presence represents Balancers voice As a thought leader in the industry the goal for the  Balancer voice is to showcase competency and relevancy through  social media outlets in a playful engaging manner

Length of Engagement  Budget
Beethoven X is requesting 3 months of funding starting May 1 2023 and ending July 31 2023 

We request to continue the budget of 25000 USDC or BAL equivalent per month for technical development and advisory Additionally we strongly believe that Beethoven X contributors can provide significant value in the areas of marketing content creation and design For this effort we propose an additional budget of 15000 USDC or BAL equivalent per month

As these funds will be used to cover a portion of contributor salaries we request that this amount be made available in a liquid form If approved 40000 USDC or BAL equivalent would be sent to the below ETH address around the first of each month

 Background
We have been researching  developing TWAMMs built on top of Balancer as a custom pool Balancer grants DAO has been extremely supportive of our endeavor and were excited to launch next month You can learn more about the project here 
httpsgithubcomCronFinanceCronFinance

 Motivation

TWAMMs and Balancer pools in general are complicated to interact with in absence of a UX We are building a dedicated relayer that abstracts the complexity from the enduser and provides safety in terms of slippage protection and error handling 

We want to do this all from a smart contract thus maintaining the advantages of a fully onchain protocol permissionless composability  decentralization Additionally we dont want our protocol to be restricted by hostile regulatory regimes that target Web UX

 Interactions

Below are the two ways to interact with the core TWAMM contracts today via Gnosis Safe or Etherscan Without a dedicated UX the user would have to know how to set slippage handle errors etc themselves

 Unsafe  complex interact through Vault
A user would have to create tuples and be knowledgeable of Balancers Vault infrastructure Furthermore they would have to abiencode data specific to TWAMM like intervals swap type etc

 Security

 The core contracts have been fully audited by SpearbitDAO httpsgithubcomspearbitportfolioblobmasterpdfsCronFinanceSpearbitSecurityReviewpdfhttpsgithubcomspearbitportfolioblobmasterpdfsCronFinanceSpearbitSecurityReviewpdf
 The periphery contract will be audited by SpearbitDAO as well
 Users of this relay will have to explicitly approve the relayer before using it
 Relayer actions will be scoped to join exit swap
 We will scope the relay to only interact with TWAMM pools recognized by our Factory contract

Gauge Proposal Template

Summary
 Swell DAO proposes the creation of a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a swETHbbaWETH pool on mainnet with a 10 emissions cap

Protocol Description

 The Swell DAO was formed to build a liquid staking protocol to provide the holders of Ethereum ETH the means to earn yield through staking without the constraint of locking up capital 
Swells mission is to create a more secure decentralized and transparent financial future for the world that does not discriminate or censor economic freedom The beginning of that journey for Swell starts with continuing to advance liquid staking as one of the fundamental building blocks of modern day decentralized finance DeFi that is composable and fully integrated with the Ethereum ecosystem Similar to other LST protocols Swell issues a liquid receipt token swETH representing your share of ether staked on the Beacon Chain via a permissioned validator set The exchange rate between swETHETH will gradually increase as staking rewards accumulate though swETH is not redeemable for the ether principal and rewards until after the Ethereum Shappella upgrade that will allow stakers to withdraw from the beacon chain

Motivation

 Swell is currently is looking to host a swETHETH pool on Balancer that serves as the main source of liquidity for swETH Swell is looking to expand the availability and liquidity of its LST starting with swETH through Balancer Ahead of and after the Ethereum Shapella upgrade liquidity and yield on LSTs will be a key competing factor as LST protocols seek integrations and a broader base of holders Swell is committed to driving value to the veBAL ecosystem by incentivizing pool liquidity via Hidden Hand voting incentives Deeper liquidity should lead to increased volume and revenue accrual

Specifications
 
1 Governance Governance will be carried out on the Swell DAO Forum httpsforumswellnetworkio  

2 Oracles 
 Direct Balance Query The swETH token has an internal  getRate function rate provider that calls swETHs own wETHToETHRate function See the contract here Contract Linkhttpsetherscanioaddress0xf951E335afb289353dc249e82926178EaC7DEd78  For this reason the token address can be specified as the rate provider
 Chainlink PoR

3 Audits httpsgithubcomSwellNetworkv3corepublicblobmasterAudit20ReportsSigma_Prime_Swell_Network_Security_Assessment_Report_v2_0pdf

4 Centralization vectors Based on current design repricing and deposits are done through a centralised bot run by the foundation Repricing requires offchain information to be published to the contract It is not possible to allow others access to this at this time as they could publish incorrect information leading to incorrect repricing rates which could have the primary effect of allowing an attacker to mint an excess of swETH The foundation has a path to getting all data needed fully onchaindecentralised through Chainlink however this will take some time

5 Market History swETH has just launched so there is not much market history and balancer will be the first pool supporting swETH
 
6 Value Swells swETHbbaWETH pool will be the main source of liquidity for swETH holders We have chosen to go with a balancer boosted pool to make our pool 100 yield bearing which will both benefit Balancer LPers and Balancer through increased fees once we transition to a core pool

Summary
 We launched a brand new Balancer pool type TWAMM This will be a cornerstone in Balancers vision of the goto AMM for DeFi protocols to build and trade upon TWAMMs are extremely capital efficient and are critical to improve the blockchains antifragility by facilitating large asset swaps completely onchain see asset monetary policy whale liquidations treasury management index fund rebalancing etc

Summary

 This pool contains a boosted  linear stable pool token bbaUSD  Balancers AAVE boosted stable pool token  STG STG is a governance token which must be staked to apply to Stargates governance in a vote escrowed fashion Stargate focuses on crosschain  omnibridge solutions They have become a large source of revenue for Balancer an ETH and OP so expansion makes sense for both parties The protocol will be earning yield on the boosted portion of this pool making the token pairing more efficient for both parties This gauge would enter as a core pool under BIP19 meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it

 Motivation

 Aave v3 is recently available on Arbitrum and Polygon networks This proposal contains four pools which are being migrated from their old gauges to new ones The primary purpose of migrating the gauges is to utilize the Aave v3 market underneath and also to move gauges from any pools in recovery mode to new implementations These new gauges use the same cap percentage as the previous implementations and are compatible with the layer zero technology for cross chain boosts once the technology goes live meaning no need to migrate these gauges in the near future New pool gauges will be activated upon the vote passing and gauges proposed to be killed will be executed 3 weeks from the passing of this proposal in the case that it does 

We will be coordinating with the various bribe marketplaces to ensure all future voting incentives only go towards the new gauges The old pools listed below will no longer have core pool status All of the migrated pools will be restored as core pools under BIP19 If a pool was not a core pool before this post it will not become a core pool now 

 Pools being migrated

 Motivation

Development of cross chain gauge boosts in collaboration with Layer Zero has progressed significantly and the new L2 gauges are ready to be used Every existing gauge on a network other than Ethereum will either be migrated to a new gauge that supports cross chain boosts or killed Balancers UI will feature the ability for veBAL lockers to sync their veBAL balance to nonethereum networks to take advantage of boosted BAL emissions  this is expected over the next one or two months

There will be two groups of transactions  group A will add the new gauges to the system and be executed immediately Group B will kill the old gauges and be executed approximately on May 9th This is to allow time for the next Aura voting cycle to complete to ensure any protocols providing voting incentives get the full value of those incentives For those new gauges which get veBAL votes before May 4th the first emissions through the new gauges would start on May 11th

Also on May 11th Balancers UI will display informational warning messages on all L2 pools which are getting a new gauge  this will provide a one click gauge migration for LPs meaning unstaking from the old gauge and restaking in the new one

 These L2 root gauges are being killed rather than migrated due to a lack of usage 12 total

 Introduction

This proposal is an update to the Orb Collective Q1 2023 Financial Update httpsforumbalancerfitorbcollectiveq12023financialupdate43192that noted the intention to carry out smart contract audits Security Represents smart contract audits that we intend to do with either Certora or ChainSecurity Each audit will cost 75k each and we anticipate that well need one audit this quarter

OpCo and Orb are now working together to renew Certorahttpswwwcertoracoms contract to perform audits Certora was selected based on their track record of quality work their longrunning relationship with the Balancer ecosystems engineering teams and their indepth knowledge and familiarity with the Balancer protocol Learn more about them herehttpswwwcertoracom

Certora will offer a package that will include the following

1 2 weeks of set up time

2 2 weeks course of writing rules

3 12 months of access to platforms

4 Support for software errors and education in rule writing including rule review

The terms of the agreement are 250K for a year paid monthly in installments of 2083333 which can be terminated anytime not locked in

The purpose of these audits is to ensure that the Orb Integrations team is shipping code that meets Balancers high standards of security keeping Balancer users and their funds as safe as possible

The final budget and arrangement will be the responsibility of OpCo with Orb supporting as intended within the DAOs Foundation and operating subsidiary governance framework We therefore propose that USDC 62500 be allocated from Orbs current budget to OpCos budget for three months in FY23 Q2 The necessary budget for FY23 Q3 onwards would form a part of OpCos year two funding proposal",10.276981466779635

Protocol Description

 InceptionLRT is an isolated Liquid Restaking protocol for Liquid Staking Tokens LSTs enabling the restaking of various LSTs with the initial focus on stETH and rETH Its core feature is the issuance of Isolated Liquid Restaking Tokens iLRTs for each restaked LST 
These iLRTs can be freely traded and used in other DeFi protocols while maintaining segregation from the underlying LSTs This architecture addresses potential risks associated with basketbased LRTs like increased complexity counterparty risk and often unclear pool rebalancing rules
InceptionLRT is specifically designed to bolster the EigenLayer framework by addressing a critical challenge the issue of liquidity locking in the protocol This advancement positions InceptionLRT as a key player in enhancing the fluidity and accessibility of restaking in the DeFi landscape


Motivation

 InceptionLRT aims to enable a gauge for instETHwstETH to substantially increase the liquidity of instETH while supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols

Avalanche Signal for deployment

Summary

The Avalanche Foundation asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into Avalanche

Proposer

The Avalanche Foundation is dedicated to supporting the Avalanche ecosystem and related technologies The Foundation is part of a larger Avalanche ecosystem and working with other organizations to support the significant development of Avalancherelated technologies

Avalanche is one of the fastest smart contracts platforms in the blockchain industry as measured by timetofinality and has the most validators securing its activity of any proofofstake protocol Avalanches CChain is an instance of the EVM running with Avalanches consensus

Rationale

Current status of the Avalanche CChain The Avalanche network is secured by over 1000 validators and is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of Avalanche consensus While maintaining this level of decentralization the network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 12 seconds making the networks CChain an incredible playground for DeFi and other EVM applications The ecosystem already has a slew of native projects offering exchange lending and aggregation services over 15bn bridged from Ethereum over 22bn in TVL and protocols such as SushiSwap and Curve deployed or in the process of deploying

Why it is good for the Aave ecosystem The Avalanche blockchain is wellsuited for building DeFi applications due to scalability high throughput and nearinstant finality Through the Avalanche Rush program the Avalanche foundation has allocated up to 20M AVAX for users of the Aave protocol over a threemonth period to earn AVAX rewards while using Aave on Avalanche for the first phase of the program This program will bring new users to the platform and reach more users from the established Avalanche community Having the Aave community embrace deployment on established chains like Avalanche will allow more users to access Aaves offerings across the DeFi ecosystem

Why signaling is necessary Consistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem he Avalanche Foundation believes that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on  and accepted by  Aave governance prior to deployment The Avalanche Rush announcement received a lot of interest from both the Aave and Avalanche communities Deploying the Aave protocol on Avalanche will support growth and synergies between the communities ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem

Next Steps

Creation of Snapshot vote for the Aave community to signal YESNO for deployment on Avalanche

 Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust thirteen 13 total risk parameters across nine 9 Aave V2 assets including LTV Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus



 Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters based on previously selected community risk level preferences First a continuation of the two previous liquidation bonus updates AIP34 Liquidation Bonus Updateshttpsappaavecomgovernance30QmccRszk94JUyj3xGcBUxUzCo43jZDQYgesEULsudVjm9v and AIP38 Liquidation Bonus Updates for Eleven Aave V2 Assetshttpsappaavecomgovernance38QmciauyTVnoHG6bAXCxHjHqTsUfiDz7rSGFxMADqFgCh4z Second updated LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters to realign with the Moderate risk levelhttpssnapshotorgaaveethproposalQmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi chosen by the community 

 Motivation

This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk tradeoffs between specific assets While increased volatility affected most assets in the ecosystem some tail assets experienced even higher volatility and larger collateral usage supply that is significantly borrowed against In addition increased liquidity and decreased trading slippage for certain assets allow for lower liquidation bonuses

SEBA submits a proposal to Aave Governance for adding SEBA Bank as a Whitelister to Aave Arc

SEBA is a licensed and supervised Swiss Bank providing a seamless and secure bridge between digital and traditional assets SEBA serves professional and institutional clients which include toptier private banks asset managers and crypto companies The interest of SEBAs clients and prospects for crypto earning products has grown substantially overtime Initially lending crypto and staking with SEBA those investors are now showing significant interest for accessing yields in DeFi protocols Due to various regulatory restrictions in their jurisdictions SEBAs institutional clientele has not been able deploy liquidities at large scale in Aave until now The launch of Aave Arc with its permissioned layer represents a great opportunity for them to access DeFi yields while remaining compliant with their regulatory obligations At SEBA we believe that this will directly benefit the Aave community with institutional liquidities accelerating growth in TVL and in protocol revenues 

The Aave Governance will review and approve Whitelisters that will conduct the requisite level of due diligence on Aave Arc participants As a Swiss digital asset bank we believe that SEBA is ideally positioned to provide those investors with the flexible and fully regulated platform that they need to bridge new liquidities in Aave Arc

 About SEBA Bank
Founded in April 2018 and headquartered in Zug Switzerland SEBA Bank is a pioneer in the banking industry with the mission to build a regulated and progressive technological bridge between the traditional and the crypto worlds With a FINMA banking and securities dealer license SEBA Bank closes an important gap between the new digital economy and traditional banking SEBA Bank enables professional individuals and companies as well as institutional clients to invest custody trade stake lend and borrow digital and traditional assets all in one place 

What SEBA brings to the Aave Arc community

	A fully regulated digital assets bank that embraces innovation
	With a large institutional client base in demand for exploring new opportunities in DeFi
	And with a bankinggrade platform to securely bridge liquidities in Aave ARC

 Simple Summary

This ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when AIP47httpsappaavecomgovernance47QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH finishes at a further 30 reduced rate

In addition to tapering incentives on the Aave V2 market the ARC proposes introducing incentives on the Aave ARC market 10 of the 30 reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 ethereum market are to be applied to incentivising AUM on the Aave ARC Ethereum market

 Abstract

Liquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via AIP16httpsappaavecomgovernance11Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG renewed by AIP32httpsappaavecomgovernance28QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E and then incentives were reduced by 30 with the implementation of AIP47httpsappaavecomgovernance47QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH which expires on the 20th February 2022 A summary is shown below

 AIP16httpsappaavecomgovernance11Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG 2200 stkAAVE per day from 26th Apr 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market

 AIPX 1078 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
 AIPX 462 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market

Continuing on from AIP47 incentives on low vol assets are to be split 12 in favour of borrowers over lenders This logic will be applied to both Aave V2 and ARC markets High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave like Balancer and Chainlink

 Motivation

This proposal continues on from AIP47 with a further 30 tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior ARChttpsgovernanceaavecomtarcaavev2liquidityminingprogram90daysat30reducedrate5946 and shall last for another proposed 90 day period We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market

The incentive APR will fall even though TVL has reduced with market conditions so has AAVEs token price

In addition to incentivising Aave V2 Ethereum market I would like to present to the community an opportunity to commence distributing stkAAVE incentives on the Aave ARC market with the intention of achieving the following

1 Grow Total Value Locked TVL
2 Increase liquidity
3 Attractive low borrow rates
4 Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor
5 Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform

Within this proposal we will present two options for the Aave ARC markets Option 2 will reflect a Total Value Locked in Aave ARC of 250M This represents a 126x increase in TVL from what is a low base The next iteration of liquidity mining will likely see an increased allocation to Aave ARC as we continue to encourage users to interact with the market The initial target here is to grow Aave ARV to over 250M within the next 90 days and then pivot as required to support continual growth of the market

 Specification

The below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 21022021 up to and including 20052022

Key changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign

 Rationale

The previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC reflects a desire to grow this mainnet market Incentivising the Aave ARC market is funded from the reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1540 to 11242 stkAAVE per day

Aarve ARC Option 1 we show what impact allocating 10 of the savings from the reduced Aave V2 Ethereum market would look like following a similar allocation strategy to the Aave V2 Ethereum market The mathematics assumes 75 utilisation of lending pools capital is borrowed which reflects the current utilisation of the DAI pool on the Aave V2 Ethereum market With zero wBTC deposited in the market and still very low capital being deposited this approach is heavily skewed towards USDC and mis represents what is expected with time

Aave ARC Option 2 we elected to view the incentives in line with 250M and assumed a distribution across the pools The distribution is an assumption and is quite different to the existing distribution on the Aave V2 Ethereum market We can easily change these parameters and are happy to do so The high level logic is to anticipate capital being deposited and then estimating what the vAPR from incentives would equate to For this we assumed 250M which is arbitrarily chosen as a nice round target it represents over 10x growth in the market TVL

 Discussion

The previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets Link herehttpsgovernanceaavecomtarcaavev2liquidityminingprogram90daysat30reducedrate5946 Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing Lending vAPY  borrowing vAPR  Borrowing Incentives vAPR  Lending vAPY

With the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas Time in the pool is also a huge factor and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so However it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider

With the introduction of incentives on Aave ARC even with around 250M deposited 60 in USDC the strategy would be profitable with a 75 utilisation rate This risks assets currently deposited in the Aave V2 Ethereum market being reallocated to the Aave ARC market If this was to occur the vAPR from incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market would increase It will be interesting to see what effect this has on the value deposited in each pool Pending how the market reacts to these proposed changes we can always revisit this and propose an amendment to the distribution schedule across both markets

 Economics

 Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around 445K per day during late January 2022 Daily aToken interest is around 19K per day
 Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost 168630 per day assuming 11242 stkAAVE at 150 per token Down from 231000 per day assuming 1540 stkAAVE at 150 per token Note previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of 320
 Ecosystem Reserve is worth around 29689M with an AAVE price of 150
 90 days at 11242 stkAAVE at 150 per token is 1518M or around 511 of the Ecosystem Reserve
 The Net spend is 122K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVEday Safety Module incentives
 Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue

Title ARC  Add DPI as Collateral on the AAVE ARC market
Status Proposal
Authors MatthewGraham metfanmike Mringz 3SEHoldings
Created 03022022



 Summary

This proposal aims to begin the onboarding process for listing DeFi Pulse Index DPI as collateral on the Aave ARC market
 Abstract

DPI is the market leading DeFi themed indices product that presents investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to some of the largest DeFi names The DPI token an ERC20 is readily traded and has strong onchain liquidity DPI is currently supported by several large institutional investors making it readily accessible to large investors

This proposal presents an opportunity for the Aave community to begin the onboarding process in working towards an Aave ARC listing This will enable Aave to offer direct exposure to defi without needing to list several tokens and as we have seen from the Aave V2 Ethereum market listing there has been significant large investor demand for DPI
 Motivation

On the 21st August 2021 Aave was the first major lending protocol to integrate an index product into its platform The value of the DPI deposited into the Aave V2 Ethereum market quickly grew to over 60M Furthermore most of this 60M was supplied by a handful of addresses which shows there is market appetite amongst investors to deposit indices like DPI on protocols like Aave ARC

DPI is the market benchmark for DeFi and is becoming the investor grade standard for DeFi Adding DPI would dramatically increase support to help make DeFi more readily accessible to more traditional investors via the KYC approved Aave ARC platform Having already found strong support within the retail segment of the market with over 15600httpsetherscaniotoken0x1494ca1f11d487c2bbe4543e90080aeba4ba3c2b holders Index Coop believes listing DPI on Aave ARC as collateral with risk parameters in line with Aave V2 Ethereum market will be an ideal listing choice offering exposure to many leading DeFi protocols through a single asset listing Furthermore being a basket of tokens the volatility characteristics make DPI ideal for use as collateral

 Rational

DPI is a basket of 13 popular DeFi tokens available on Ethereum The methodology behind DPI is from Scalara formally Pulse Inc a subsidiary of DeFi Pulse The criteria for token selection can be found herehttpswwwscalaraxyz DPI is the most popular DeFi index product with 100m AUM and over 15600 holders

DPI is built on top of Set Protocol and managed by Index Coop Index Coop is a decentralized and autonomous asset manager governed maintained and upgraded by INDEX token holders

Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset

DPI would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem because it allows for a large pool of dormant capital 100m in non incentivized DPI AUM to find a productive use Additionally

 Significant Borrow Demand There is significant desire from whales to lend out the DeFi Pulse index and to use the DPI as collateral to borrow stablecoins for farming going leveraged longshort and implementing structured products eg carry trade
 Low Volatility Because indices are a basket of tokens they represent less volatility than the component assets by themselves
 Efficient Sector Representation Adding an index as collateral also gives exposure to all the component tokens while only having to add in a single token thus saving gas in Aaves system
 Liquidity via Primary and Secondary Markets Minting and redeeming represent the primary market of the indices but many users can buy and sell indices on the secondary markets  mostly Uniswap The price on the secondary markets are kept at Net Asset Value the market value of all the underlying components through a network of market makers that redeem the tokens when price is below NAV and vice versa

Additionally IndexCoop DAO is voting on a liquidity mining campaign to draw TVL to the Arc Market and give institutions a taste of the power of token incentives

 DPI for Institutions

IndexCoop the DAO issuer of DPI has relationships with Fireblocks a whitelister for the Aave ARC Market as well as BitGo and Coinbase Custody to provide institutional custodial options as well as deep liquidity through partnerships with market maker and ARC market participant Wintermute

Listing DPI will allow institutions to gain access to direct DeFi exposure without Aave ARC needing to list many tokens

 Specification

DeFi Pulse Index DPI should be whitelisted for use on the Aave Arc Market The address of the token on the Ethereum Main Network is 0x1494CA1F11D487c2bBe4543E90080AeBa4BA3C2b

title ARC  Consolidate Aave V1 V2  AMM Reserve Factors Purchase CVX and Deploy to Earn Yield
author Llama Community MatthewGraham Dydymoon 
created 03012022

httpsgovernanceaavecomtarcconsolidateaavev1v2ammreservefactorspurchasecvxanddeploytoearnyield6797


 Simple Summary

The Aave V1 V2 and AMM market Reserve Factors RF on the Ethereum network hold a combined value of over 2827MhttpsdunexyzllamaAaveTreasuryFinancesbyLlamaTrailing20Num20TimeSeries60 The Llama Community proposes consolidating the RF into the V2 RF and deploying the capital with the intention of retaining TVL and earning additional yield The yield generated comes with the added benefit of acquiring governance tokens of other DeFi protocols and increasing Aaves metagovernance influence

 Abstract

The Llama Community recommends implementing several yield generating strategies spanning Balancer Curve and Convex and subsequently participating in the respective communities tokenomic constructs Aave will earn yield in the form of swap fee income aToken yield derived from Aave V2 and governance token incentives in the form of BAL CRV CVX stkAAVE and LDO

The first investment theme is deploying capital into the Balancer Boosted Pool and BTC Stable Pool to earn a vAPY of around 134 and 46 respectively The Balancer Boosted Pool invests around 80 or more of the deposited liquidity into Aave V2 to earn yield whilst also generating swap fees stkAAVE and BAL rewards The Stable Pool generates income via swap fees and BAL rewards with the latter making up the majority of the incentives on both strategies

The second investment theme is more complex It involves acquiring both CVX and veCRV to participate in gauge weight voting on Curve in order to influence a portion of the CRV inflation schedules to be distributed to aToken pool Liquidity Providers LPs Aave will deploy stables and ETH from the RF to earn additional CRV and CVX rewards which will be used to further boost the incentive allocation to the aToken pools

The data presented here is accurate as of the end of December 2021 data

 Motivation

 Part A  Consolidation

The legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times There is only 219Mhttpsappv1aavecomhome of TVL remaining in the V1 market and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time

602x232httpslh4googleusercontentcomKqln89Od7cLnxfnd5sEq4gn6xMD2yrAocqa8nJOaXQoyjQ4GlNkgfw8pQ7E2skefYXPdtiqSLwWL_KtYcNiO6Qjciy0I296Q7eiz0R9_NEO1nhZSPJtMqReDXg4N7SOqTjzsEC

This proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1 V2 and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield The V1 RF holds around 821Khttpsetherscanioaddress0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae of assets at the time of writing whereas the Ethereum V2  AMM market holds 2745Mhttpsetherscanioaddress0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c of assets Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around 2827MhttpsdunexyzllamaAaveTreasuryFinancesbyLlamaTrailing20Num20TimeSeries60 A summary of the main assets held in the V1 RF are shown below

 Part B  Retain TVL  Increase Returns

Whilst holding aTokens is arguably one of the lowest risk yield opportunities in DeFi and something Llama Community encourages most if not all treasuries to hold The Aave DAO is fortunate since it receives income in the form of aTokens Thus Llama recommends firstly making all unproductive stable coins productive and then optimizing further by earning additional yield and metagovernance influence

The two main high level strategies proposed in this ARC share three common goals

 Retain TVL within Aave
 Exceed aToken returns
 Accumulate metagovernance influence

In addition to these three goals the Convex  Curve strategies have the added benefit of improving the extrinsic use cases for aTokens aToken holders will be able to deposit liquidity into the Curve aToken pools and then deposit the Liquidity Provider LP token into either Curve or Convex to earn additional yield

The Compound pool on Curve has 1745Mhttpscurveficompound of TVL relative to the Aave pool which has 553Mhttpscurvefiaave of TVLThis is most likely due to the higher incentive APR that the Compound pool 1013 vAPY relative to the Aave pool earning 758 vAPY on Convex

 Specification

 Overview

Llama proposes diversifying 2667M 9436 of the combined Ethereum RFs across three protocols Convex Curve and Balancer The combined Aave V1 AMM and V2 market RF totals 2827MhttpsdunexyzllamaAaveTreasuryFinancesbyLlamaTrailing20Num20TimeSeries60 at the time of writing A detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune DashboardhttpsdunexyzllamaAaveTreasuryFinancesbyLlamaTrailing20Num20TimeSeries60 and a highlevel overview is shown in the figure below

The actual implementation of this proposal is likely to be spread across several AIPs This is to reduce the implementation complexity and allow the several positions to be swapped  redeemed before being deployed into a bonding curve whilst we await the Chainlink CVX oracle being released and getting the Aave V2 RF whitelisted to deposit into the CRV locking contract to attain veCRV

The subsequent sections provide further insight into each strategy and how they are to be funded

 Convex  Curve Strategy

 Convex Allocation

The Convex CVX allocation is to be funded by the assets mentioned in the table below

602x372httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard21uploadsaaveoriginal2X4468f451db851df2f8c4ec9f3bc28fd81647492dapng

In order to fund the initial 2M purchase of CVX all of the AMPL BUSD and TUSD will be used 8422K and the balance 116M will be funded with USDC This is the initial purchase of CVX and with a unit price of 4320 is equivalent to about 46300 CVX tokens

We expect to make additional CVX purchases in order to meet the minimum voting hurdle required to influence how Convexs veCRV holding is deployed on Curve gauges Based upon this snapshothttpsvoteconvexfinancecomproposalQmRgsaGswSgzuzaiiH385StTGsv5TVdhAA1LWBGWR3yyLp and the Voting Rules and Informationhttpsdocsconvexfinancecomconvexfinancegeneralinformationvotingandgaugeweights section of Convexs documentation we estimate around 70000 CVX votes are needed to clear the hurdle rate This is expected to cost a further 102M to what is proposed above and represents less than 1 months revenue We intend to fund this through future revenue and have a sufficient buffer to the hurdle rate based upon voter participation on Convexs snapshot

The assets are to be converted to ETH and then used to purchase CVX via a Bonding Curve with a 50 bps premium that utilizes a Chainlink oracle price feed Alternative methods can be discussed in the comments However we opt for a solution that can be implemented entirely through the AIP governance process and does not include manual trading

AMPL is the most illiquid of the mentioned tokens and this position will need to be converted to ETH over a series of transactions Trades are to be routed through an aggregator with MEV protection like CowSwap The most liquid AMPL pools are on Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap Wherever possible aTokens will be swapped rather than redeemed in an attempt to retain TVL in the Aave V2 market

The newly acquired CVX will be locked for 16 weeks with voting rights delegated to Llama in order to vote on both Aave and sAave gauges via Convexs snapshot to increase the amount of CRV rewards received on the Curve pools Voting occurs every 2 weeks via Snapshot and thus the need for a delegate

The locked CVX also receives a portion of the protocol fee income and votes on how Convexs veCRV are distributed across Curves gauges Llama Community acting as the delegate will vote to boost CRV rewards on the Aave pool as a priority and sAave once sufficient voting influence has been attained

 4 Year Locked Curve veCRV Allocation

The aCRV tokens that have accumulated within Aave V2 are to be redeemed for CRV and then locked for 4 years on Curve to receive an equal amount of veCRV This strategy is subject to Aaves V2 RF being approved and whitelisted via Curves governance process

602x372httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard21uploadsaaveoriginal2X221477469e7d025cafd72614e98c3e6cd4e3236cfpng

The veCRV position will then be used to vote for CRV incentives to be allocated to the Aave and sAave pools via the respective gauges Based on the CVX strategy discussed prior these veCRV votes are likely to be allocated to the sAave gauge

Subject to the timeline and attaining the whitelist permission to deposit into Curves veCRV contract the alternative strategy is to convert CRV to cvxCRV then stake to earn CRV CVX and 3crv pulse any airdrops that go to veCRV holders This is expected to generate 4735 vAPY see snippet below

602x244httpslh3googleusercontentcomv6jyNfHVIrr7ovNveVCupxypxFTzoZfLAP3_aGSwRHVcNezLxZIPvmmLHitPMI7TzrFRm9GSRpimpcuJqnZLXOvJ5SUai1_2jStwPxr02Uyge60q2WDCx0dS4eU4GnwAblDACD

The earned CRV will be converted to cvxCRV and this will compound over time The earned CVX will be locked to increase Aaves voting influence and the 3crv will be exchanged for CRV then converted to cvxCRV to further compound the strategies returns over time

 Productive aToken Stable Strategy

The sAave and Aave strategies include depositing capital into a Curve pool and then staking the LP token on Convex to earn stkAAVE CVX and CRV rewards The two strategies are expected to generate around 407 vAPY and 619 vAPY before Aaves CRV and CVX voting influences the CRV incentive derived yield

The table below shows the allocation how each strategy is funded and which pool those funds are to be deposited into

602x244httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard21uploadsaaveoriginal2X003ca5c3d9bf70c960c6769e35b6a630d64b6ce18png

 Productive ETH Strategy

After transferring the ETH from Aave V1 RF to Aave V2 RF the awETH is to be redeemed for ETH and the combined ETH deposited into the Curve stETH pool The LP token steCRV is to then be deposited and staked in Convex to earn CRV CVX and LDO incentives The expected yield is around 665 vAPY

602x244httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard21uploadsaaveoriginal2X33d101f6f395bb1310f0d58031136da366e6ee838png

No vlCVX or veCRV voting rights will be used to attract CRV incentives on this pool as the pool does not contain any aTokens

 Balancer Strategy

 Balancer Boosted Pool Strategy

Balancer has recently launched the first Boosted Poolhttpsappbalancerfipool0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000feutm_sourcewebsiteutm_mediumbannerutm_campaignaaveboostedpools on Wednesday 16th December and liquidity mining incentives have already commenced generating around 134 vAPY at the time of writing Using the Stable Poolhttpsappbalancerfipool0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42000000000000000000000063 as a guide we expect Balancer to grow the Boosted Pool with the use of Liquidity Mining LM and even replace the Stable Pool in time

The Balancer Boosted Pools earn swap fee income LM incentives and a new type of yield derived from unproductive capital being deposited into Aave V2 to earn yield Llama expects the yield of the Boosted pool to exceed the Stable Pool in order to entice users to move across Llama expects LM incentives to be the mechanism for achieving an elevated return while the pool is in its bootstrapping phase

The strategy for Aave is to deposit an equal amount of DAI USDC and USDT into the Boosted Pool All BAL rewards are to be retained to accumulate governance influence

Cronos is the first Ethereumcompatible blockchain network built on Cosmos SDK technology An opensource Layer 1 chain launched under the  Cryptoorghttpcryptoorg  umbrella Cronos aims to massively scale the DeFi and dApp Web3 user community by providing builders with the ability to instantly port apps and crypto assets from other chains while benefiting from low transaction fees high throughput and fast finality

In 2020 and 2021 hundreds of millions of consumers have purchased their first cryptos the majority via a centralized exchange Tens of millions of them already have a connection with the strategic partners of the Cronos project as Cryptocomhttpcryptocom  customers as holders of CRO or other tokens of the Cosmos ecosystem andor as Cryptoorghttpcryptoorg  project supporters These crypto users are now eager to take the next step in Web3 For them Cronos is a natural gateway into the broader world of selfcustody Ethereum and DeFi

The crosschain future that is such an integral part of Aave V3 resonates well with the motivations of Cronos users Therefore Cronos represents an ideal ground to demonstrate the promise of Aave V3

Technical specifications of the network

Network specifications

Cronoshttpscronoscryptoorg  is an opensource project launched by  Cryptoorghttpcryptoorg  that brings together many  opensource initiativeshttpsgithubcomcryptoorgchaincronosblobmaingomodL22  of the Ethereum Cosmos and IBC Inter Blockchain Communication ecosystems At its core it is a fully EVMcompatible alternative Layer 1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK Ethermint implementation

Cronos mainnet has been live since November 2021 and is already home to more than 120 partners and more than 340000 DeFi and NFT users Cronos is powered by the CRO cryptocurrency which counts tens of millions of holders and users worldwide thanks to its support by  Cryptocomhttpcryptocom  All key network statistics can be viewed on the Etherscan deployment called  Cronoscanhttpscronoscancomcharts   as well as on  Defillama for TVL datahttpsdefillamacomchainCronos  

At the protocol level Cronos relies on a Proof of Authority consensus where each validators voting power is proportional to their stake in the protocols staking token There are currently 26 live validators with room for more The consensus delivers fast finality with block times between 5 and 6 seconds low transaction fees usually below 1 USD paid in CRO token and small environmental footprint

Users and Dapp developers interact with Cronos primarily through the usual EVM Web3 JSONRPC  endpointshttpscronoscryptoorgdocsresourceschainintegrationhtmljsonrpcnamespaces   They can deploy any EVMcompatible smart contract written in Solidity and can use all the usual enduser and developer tooling MetaMask Etherscan block explorer Cronoscanhttpscronoscancom  Gnosis Safe Truffle Hardhat Web3js Ethersjs Web3py etc

The Cronos team is actively in contact with the relevant teams to implement all the components needed for robust Aave V3 deployment and operations specifically the Chainlink oracle The Graph indexer and commercial and JSONRPC endpoints for Dapps in addition to the existing  free oneshttpscronoscryptoorgdocsresourceschainintegrationhtmljsonrpcnamespaces   These teams are in process of assigning engineering resources to work on these project A likely target launch date for these additional components is early Q2 2022 Cronos protocol engineering resources stand ready to support these projects

There are several bridges between Cronos and other networks 

 Live Fast withdrawals from and to the  Cryptocomhttpcryptocom  app and exchange
 Upcoming Native bridge from and to the Ethereum mainnet via Gravity Bridge technology currently in testing and planned for imminent launch
 Live IBC transfers from and to the  Cryptoorghttpcryptoorg  chain Cosmos Hub and Terra with more IBCcompatible chains on the roadmap
 Live EVM smart contractbased transfers from and to BSC Polygon and other EVM chains via 3 independent bridges with more to come
 Security review of additional bridges is under way

Cronos is an open ecosystem supported by a wide range of more than 120  contributorshttpsgithubcomcryptoorgchaincronos    validatorshttpscronoscryptoorgpartners   and  Dapp developershttpscronoscryptoorgecosystem   This includes 2 large AMMDEXes VVS Finance 14 B TVL and MM Finance 320 M TVL

The  roadmaphttpsmediumcomcronoschaincronoschainjourneysofarand2022roadmap3475abbe6254  is ambitious and includes protocol and database optimizations further connectivity and interoperability bestinclass tooling and infrastructure further protocol governance decentralization dozens of DeFi and GameFi Dapps and longer term plans to increase scalability

Aave V3 implementation

As part of this proposal Aave V3 will be deployed to Cronos like any Web3 protocol given that Cronos is fully EVMcompatible Aave operations will rely on the Chainlink oracle and The Graph indexer implementation under way

The Aave V3 Portal will be able to leverage robust EVMbased crosschain bridges such as Connext and others subject to further testing and security review for the transfer of underlying assets backing aTokens

Proposed list of initial collaterals

The proposed list of initial collaterals is CRO WETH WBTC USDC USDT DAI ATOM LUNA DOT

As indicated above Chainlink price feeds are being scheduled for deployment

Cronos already supports the  following crosschain assetshttpscronoscryptoorgdocsresourceschainintegrationhtmlintegrationguideforcronosmainnetbeta   CRO WETH WBTC USDC USDT DAI SHIB DOGE ATOM LINK ENJ ELON TUSD LUNA DOT BIFI with more to come Additional native tokens include VVS TONIC These tokens have between 10 M and 700 M of liquidity on Cronos Daily volume for the corresponding pairs is between 20 and 30 M

The proposed tokens have more than or close to 2 M daily volume each With respect to DEX statistics see  VVS analyticshttpsvvsfinanceinfo  for history and liquidity per token

Incentives

Particle B the Web3 accelerator of the Cronos chain has an initial allocation of USD 100 million in CRO tokens for ecosystem development A portion of these funds will be allocated to enduser incentives commensurate with the large user and TVL growth potential of Aave V3 on Cronos

In our experience the effectiveness of liquidity mining incentives varies depending on market conditions hence the exact programs and amounts expected to be worth several M will need to be refined over time

 Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list alUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave alUSD has established itself as one of the leading new stablecoins in terms of stability and liquidity and listing on Aave will provide users with a proven stablecoin to borrow Alchemix has 376m TVL in the form of yvDAI and DAI backing alUSD with a liquid supply of 239m alUSD alUSD has one of the deepest Curve pools with 450m in liquidity In addition to the Curve pool alUSD has additional liquidity on Sushiswap Saddle and mStable According to Parsec Finances StableRank alUSD is routinely among the top stablecoins in terms of price stability and liquidity within 1 slippage Having been on the market for over 6 months while maintaining the peg through turbulent market conditions alUSD has built the reputation required to be an asset listed on AAVE

alUSD StableRank ScreenshothttpsimgurcomaiMyToUj

 About Alchemix and alUSD
Alchemix is an evolution of the tried and true CDP model trailblazed by MakerDAO Alchemix is at its core an overcollateralized stablecoin much like DAI and other similar tokens It has some key differences however

Alchemix only mints likekind or mirror alAssets For example alUSD is only mintable by DAI and later USDT and USDC and alETH is only mintable by ETH and later other ETH derivatives Deposited collateral is then deployed to yearn of which the earned yield doubly repays users debt and backs the dollar peg in the Transmuter module In addition there is no interest paid in the borrowing of alAssets Due to this structure Alchemix does not have liquidations in its system This allows people to maximum borrow without fear of shifting market conditions  taking an essentially risk free negative interest alUSD loan with their DAI In effect the system acts as a way to get an advance on your yield for your stablecoin deposits

Alchemix ensures the alUSD peg with the following mechanisms
1 50 LTV for minting alUSD which prevents excessive recursive leverage in the protocol
2 DAOmanaged debt caps that limit the overminting of alUSD
3 The ability to repay debt in alUSD or DAI If alUSD is under the peg people can buy it off the market and repay their loan at a discount If alUSD is over the peg users can sell alUSD to DAI and repay with DAI to arbitrage the price and they can selfliquidate their collateral to mint more alUSD to trade to DAI for arbitrage
4 The Transmuter module guarantees 11 conversions of alUSD to DAI the conversion process isnt instant but it can present good arbitrage opportunities which helps to stabilize the peg
5 Alchemix rewards ALCX governance tokens for alUSD liquidity providers which attracts liquidity to the pool further boosting the peg

alUSD minted from a new loan has a collateralization ratio of 200 while alUSD minted from repaid debt has a collateralization ratio of 100 The total global collateralization ratio for alUSD is 157 The supply can expand in two ways  an expansion in the debt ceiling followed by users taking new loans or debt repayments with DAI which decrement the global debt while not destroying alUSD This is how we have a supply of 239m with a current debt cap of 150m alUSD can be burned by staking it in the transmuter where it is converted 11 to DAI over time

These mechanisms in tandem have allowed for alUSD to remain extremely close to the 1 peg since its inception

 Motivation
alUSD has established itself as a reliable and liquid stablecoin In addition to protocol improvements Alchemix DAO believes that integrating alUSD throughout DeFi will help us in that goal Because AAVE is the leading lending protocol across all of crypto getting on AAVE as a borrowable asset would lend a lot of legitimacy to alUSD The more tightly integrated alUSD is within DeFi the more resilient it will become which will allow alUSD to safely grow in supply

Going forward Alchemix will expand beyond our current set up of using DAI in the yvDAI yearn vault as collateral and expand the selection of stablecoin collaterals and yield earning strategies AAVE is one such source of yield that we are looking to plug into in the future When these upgrades take place we predict that Alchemix will be one of the larger liquidity providers to AAVE similar to how Alchemix is currently one of the largest liquidity providers on Yearn

 alUSD Benefits to Aave Users
alUSD is desirable to borrow because it is tightly pegged to DAI USDC USDT mUSD FEI FRAX and LUSD in our various markets It is simple to swap between other stables DEX aggregators make it simple to trade between alUSD and any other asset on Ethereum too In addition there are attractive farming incentives for alUSD LPs For people that are looking to borrow alUSD but dont have stablecoins from which to mint it borrowing alUSD on AAVE will provide more options to get alUSD The alUSD can be used for yield farming or through highly liquid swaps into other stable coins to finance their personal life or to speculate on the market alUSD is also used in an alETHalUSD options market on premiafinance Alchemix plans to continue to expand alUSD use cases in the future through partnerships and integrations

 Security Considerations and Risk Analysis
Certik Audit for the Core Contracts httpsalchemixfia208baf6ca7e0d6b0116461f05e27cd9pdf

Currently the Alchemix protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig The protocol controls the alUSD debt cap and collateralization ratio through DAO voting which is then executed by a community  developer multisig  timelock contract The DAO prioritizes peg stability above all else when considering parameter changes

Aave has already conducted risk analysis on DAI the current sole backing stablecoin of alUSD and assigned an overall risk rating of B Risks per Asset  Riskhttpsdocsaavecomriskassetriskrisksperasset USDC and USDT strategies will be added as alUSD collateral later USDC and USDT have ratings of A and B respectively The new risks from introducing alUSD are AlchemixalUSD and Yearn Vault contract risks Risk to Aave is minimized due to alUSD being enabled for borrowing but not as collateral

The Alchemix DAO multisig and timelock wallet is the administrator for the alUSD token It has the ability to grant and revoke other contracts the minter role Currently all alUSD minting is handled by the alchemistsol contract When we launch our version two the new contracts will also be granted the minting permissions Alchemix employs a modular approach where the Transmuter and Vault Adapter modules can be swapped out and replaced with upgraded versions The core alchemistsol contract cannot be upgraded but the multisig and timelock wallet can change the following parameters collateralization ratio debt ceiling and fee percentage Each member of the core Alchemix development team has permission to enable Alchemixs sentinel mode which pauses the contract in case of an emergency

Forum post Listing proposal add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyonhttpsgovernanceaavecomtlistingproposaladdjeuronaavev3onpolyon7353


 Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Networks jEUR a synthetic euro stablecoins on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon jEUR is a liquid and capitalefficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC and with a working 0fee fiat on and offramp jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curves pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity

 About Jarvis Network
Synthereum is the first protocol of the Jarvis Networkhttpsjarvisnetwork It provides a capitalefficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs on Ethereum Polygon Gnosis Chain Avalanche and the BNB Chain

jFIATs main feature is their convertibility for their collateral USDC on Polygon and for other jFIATs at the oracle price without price impact enabling a 0slippage onchain Forex This feature makes them usable since one can convert them for USDC at any time they keep their peg and have the same market depth as USDC and therefore are very liquid

The protocol is integrated within Paraswap so users can swap jEUR for any other token

We have partnered with Mt Pelerinhttpswwwmtpelerincom a Swiss regulated entity to provide users with a 0fee 11 fiat on and offramp directly on Polygon and other EVM chains Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon back and forth One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices salaries rent and even taxes since July last year

Combined with Paraswap this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros at a better rate than most CEX including Binance Kraken etc

We also have launched jXAFjXOF which are wrappers of jEUR XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro to address the African market  we are building a fiat on and offramp in Africa Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAFjXOF holders

jEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price therefore other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg or simply to access greater liquidity

We debuted on Polygon around September Currently version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR A second version of the protocol without those limitations will be launched soon

The protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works 625k of USDC has enabled since October

 35M jEUR in circulation 4M
 78M of volume on our primary market
 33k swaps by 9k users
 20M of transfers wallet to wallet excluding swaps
 50M on secondary markets Curve Kyber
 10M of fiat on and offramp
 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders

 Benefits for Aave V3
 Fiat on and offramp
jEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and offramp which can create a direct bridge between banks and a Euro savings account on the Blockchain

We have multiple nonindividuals companies who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs like on Curve

Having jEUR on Aave combined with our fiat onramp would allow this use case to become a reality and would allow users to borrow jEUR and offramp them for Euros

 Large addressable market
A part from the Euro zone jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the endusers people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it in reality we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR but the enduser wont see it

 jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins
jEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon

 DDM
jEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets to maintain a lowinterest rate if needed

 Low risk collateral
As collateral jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buyingselling it on our primary market

jEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave

jEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades


 Risk Parameters
With the liquidity on Polygon in mind I propose the following risk parameters Obviously this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters

1 V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins if it exists 97 LTV 98 liquidation threshold 10 reserve factor
2 V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins 90 LTV 95 Liquidation threshold 10 reserve factor
3 V3 Isolation mode 50 LTV 80 liquidation threshold 20 reserve factor 2M debt ceiling

 Security specification and risks

 Risks inherent to jEUR
Besides obvious smart contract risks jEUR is overcollateralized with USDC and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC

jEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMAs DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols


More informations about the riskshttpslearnjarvisnetworkprotocoloverviewrisks


 Token  Protocol permissions minting and upgradability
jEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon users can send X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint X of jEUR or the multisig can call the minting function from the DDM module

There is currently no DAO only a communityowned multisig 58 managing the treasury and two companyowned multisig 23 one admin and one maintainer the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols minting and burning fees address receiving the fees addingremoving a new jFIAT addingremoving supported collateral calling the emergency shutdown function settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed changing the price feed

It does not have any accesscontrol over any funds and we are transitioning to a vemodel together with a token rebranding in Q2 accompanying the launch our the protocol v2

Proposal to add support for MAI aka miMatic on Aave V3 On Polygon Fantom and Avalanche

 Summary

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is noncustodial All MAI is backed by collateral locked in usermanaged vaults MAI minting is available on 8 chains and bridging to 18 chains

All accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns

Theres around 250M MAI minted with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom

 Risk Parameters

 V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins 97 LTV 98 Liquidation threshold 10 reserve factor
 V3 Isolation mode 75 LTV 80 liquidation threshold 10 reserve factor 50M initial debt ceiling per chain

 Specifications

1 What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset

Core team at QiDao Protocol

2 Provide a brief highlevel overview of the project and the token

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0 interest

MAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon Avalanche Fantom Arbitrum Harmony Moonriver and Gnosis Chain MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi currently on 18 chains through Multichain Accepted collateral includes interestbearing assets like Aave Market Tokens Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI  instead they are charged a 05 fee upon repayment

Despite market downturns during its existence MAI has maintained its peg

MAI currently has a TVL of around 350M and has around 250M MAI outstanding

3 Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset
Being the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI

MAI is one of the most crosschain assets available on 18 chains through canonical bridging As a result users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has

MAIs risk profile is low It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon MAI has also received grants from several blockchains including Polygon Fantom Harmony Aurora and IoTeX

4 Provide a brief history of the project and the different components DAO is it live products are the live How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced

 MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol a communityrun DAO around the QI token
 Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing including Frax Finance Stake DAO Celsius  PolygonDAO SpiritSwap SpookySwap Gotchi Vault and Beefy Finance
 The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao

5 How is the asset currently used

 Lending Marketxyz Impermax Tarot
 Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains Main DEXs are Curve Balancer QuickSwap SpookySwap SpiritSwap Solidly Saber and TombSwap
 Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon
 MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM
 MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties
 MAI offers lowcost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO Yearn Beefy and Aave

6 Emission schedule

Users can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0 interest Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation

7 Token  Protocol permissions minting and upgradability Is there a multisig What can it do Who are the signers

All funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users
There is a 35 multisig comprised by the QiDao team Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts live streams and crypto conferences
The multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes liquidation ratios for new collaterals partnerships and debt ceilings There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO see votes here 1
Since the protocol uses canonical bridging QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to

A proposal to adjust six 6 total risk parameters including LTV Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across three 3 Aave V2 assets In addition Gauntlet recommends freezing legacy KNC 

 Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the Moderate risk levelhttpssnapshotorgaaveethproposalQmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi chosen by the Aave community These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations


 Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk tradeoffs between specific assets

Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics insolvencies liquidations and borrow usage Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function Our agentbased simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis including but not limited to asset volatility asset correlation asset collateral usage DEX  CEX liquidity trading volume expected market impact of trades and liquidator behavior Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics As such the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation The individual collateral pages on the Gauntlet Risk Dashboardhttpsgovgauntletnetworkaave cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations

 Freezing Legacy KNC

The KyberDAO approved the proposal to migrate KNC token contracthttpsgithubcomKyberNetworkKIPsblobmasterKIPskip6md to a new implementation on 4202021 which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently As of 3282022 roughly 195M of KNC have migrated to the new Kyber Network Crystal KNChttpsetherscaniotoken0xdefa4e8a7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202 and 57M of KNC are still in the old KNC Legacy KNCL contracthttpsetherscaniotoken0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200 There are currently 29M KNCL supplied and 900K total borrowed on Aave v2

Considering that exchanges eg Krakenhttpssupportkrakencomhcenusarticles4401758213268KyberKNCtokenmigration Cryptocomhttpsblogcryptocomcryptocomsupportsthekybernetworkknctokenmigration have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform

364,"To increase Aave protocol V3 efficiency and allow faster updates to caps on V3 markets this snapshot vote intends to implement a fast track framework for these caps

Suggested fasttrack process 

Step 1  Governance thread for 24h
Step 2  Snapshot with immediate vote open for 48h
Step 3  Community multisig enforcement

Suggested scope  limitations of the fasttrack process 
 Fasttrack can only act on Supply  Borrow caps within a 30 to 100 modification range
 Fasttrack requires an 80k AAVE quorum
 This process can only be applied to assets listed for at least 2 weeks
 The process should take maximum 4 days Meaning that in networks currently with Guardian the Guardian should prepare the signing in advance to assure execution not more than 24h after Snapshot closes positively

This current proposal also would also upgrade the USDC supply cap on Aave Avalanche V3 market of 100 to a new total of 4B meaning that both adoption and execution of this framework would be the outcome of this proposal if YAE is leading at the end of the vote

365," Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine 9 total risk parameters including LTV Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across five 5 Aave V2 assets 

 Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the Moderate risk levelhttpssnapshotorgaaveethproposalQmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi chosen by the Aave community These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations


 Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk tradeoffs between specific assets

Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics insolvencies liquidations and borrow usage Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function Our agentbased simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis including but not limited to asset volatility asset correlation asset collateral usage DEX  CEX liquidity trading volume expected market impact of trades and liquidator behavior Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics As such the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation The individual collateral pages on the Gauntlet Risk Dashboardhttpsgovgauntletnetworkaave cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations

366,"Summary 

sUSD is a decentralized stable coin over collateralized by the SNX token sUSD is already listed on AAVE markets as a lendable asset as well as SNX which can be used as collateral in addition to borrowlending There is significant liquidity for sUSD on both Mainnet and Optimism I am proposing for it to be enabled as collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism with a 10 million sUSD supply cap

Risk Parameters
 set sUSD max LTV to 60
 set liquidation threshold to 75
 set liquidation penalty to 5
 upgrade the interest rate curve to that of DAITUSD
 Fixed lending is not enabled

Motivation

sUSD market cap has grown tremendously over the past year and the steady demand for decentralized stable coins has contributed to its growth sUSD is highly over collateralized by SNX the governance token and backstop for the Synthetix protocol

The rise in its liquidity on major dexes has contributed to sUSD stability over the past year and allowing collateral use would promote its liquidity in aave markets

Rationale

SNX stakers are incentivized to actively manage their debt relative to their SNX stake and sometimes cause spikes in demand for sUSD on markets including AAVE especially when there are other Yield generating opportunities with sUSD this may cause small deviations from the peg but with low volatility

From a counterparty risk perspective all underlying functions in relation to sUSD are fundamentally the same as that of SNX

The SNX and sUSD contracts are fully upgradeable Still all changes must go through a formal governance process from SIP to deployment which would be announced well before the upgrades are made and thus does not present a substantial counterparty risk

The sUSDv2CRV pool has deep liquidity on L1 and with incentivizes the L2 pool will soon have deep liquidity 

In addition to sUSD there are other synth pools on Curve with emission gauges to supplement sUSD liquidity sBTC sETH  All synths are redeemable at their dollar value in sUSD at the ChainLink quoted price through the Synthetix protocol or Curve via crossasset swaps thus they help facilitate the arbitrage sUSD peg deviations

A proposal to whitelist Connext a trust minimized cross chain protocol for V3 Portals on 6 chains Optimism Arbitrum Polygon Avalanche Fantom Harmony  with credit lines for USDC 2m on each chain USDT 1m on each chain and ETH 40 ETH on each chain

 Reasonale

Connexthttpsconnextnetwork is a network for fast trustless communication between chains and rollups It is the only interoperability system of its type that does this cheaply and quickly without introducing any new trust assumptions Connext is aimed at developers who are looking to build bridges and other natively crosschain applications
To date over 13b in transactions have crossed the network

Our network of liquidity providers only works with native assets or the most canonical representation of a wrapped asset

With our Amarok upgradehttpsblogconnextnetworkannouncingtheamaroknetworkupgrade5046317860a4 a series of improvements are coming for users developers and liquidity providers routers the latest will be tasked with providing capital upfront to the users while getting refunded within 30 minutes when the slower confirmation coming from the Optimistic communication protocol Nomadhttpsblogconnextnetworkoptimisticbridgesfb800dc7b0e0 is completed

Users transactions get confirmed in seconds LPs get rewarded with a fee on the transaction for their service

Portals are therefore a perfect match for Connext as our LPs will need and want to access immediate extra liquidity to fulfill transactions and our new architecture allows for this operation to be completed via the protocol in a trust minimized way

 Technical Specifications

Connext is much more than a bridge its an interoperability protocol it allows to build cross chain applications without adding trust assumptions
One of these applications are bridges others could be cross chain NFTs marketplaces or cross chain governance portals

51 routers are currently providing 40m of liquidity
The highly capital efficient architecture of Connext allows for higher volume and therefore higher returns with less capital compared to other solutions in the space
The system is currently working on a whitelist basis Once the NEXT tokenhttpsblogconnextnetworkwhatsnextd3044de49397 is live the whole network will be permissionless

 How does it work

This is an overview of the Amarok architecture that is currently on testnet and planned to go live in a few weeks

imageipfsQmZVvSsU5ra6vFvMiu82iMAieP1LFuS44EjsbLJVkeUj8N

The new flow heavily utilizes Nomad and eventually other localized messaging layers for its security model Routers front capital and execute calls for a users transaction and claim against funds going through Nomad


A full overview can be found herehttpsblogconnextnetworkannouncingtheamaroknetworkupgrade5046317860a4

This model fits with the Aave Portals This is how the simplified architecture integrating Portals will look like  credits to Delphi Digital for the image

1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1 Since then 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol Limit Order Protocol P2P transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet

This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token 1INCH as a collateral asset in Aave

 Motivations
Launched in 2019 and with over 60 of the market share 1 the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space The 1inch Networks metrics are below source 1

Total trading volume 160B
Total swaps 591M
Total users 125M

1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network 1INCH has a circulating market cap of 500M 1 a daily trading volume of 50M and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase Binance FTX Gemini and Kraken In addition to the spot markets 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange

The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation  the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 15 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4

In December of 2021 1inch Labs completed a 175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors

 Benefits to Aave Community

1INCH is highly liquid
1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms so Aave will have a firstmover advantage
1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets  there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH
1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020 to accredited and institutional investors who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds

RoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network

2 Provide a brief highlevel overview of the project and the token
1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols revenue stream 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program 3

3 Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset
1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space

1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance FTX and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX

1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020 to accredited and institutional investors who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds Currently none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling

On the demand side users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program or support specific governance proposals

4 Provide a brief history of the project and the different components DAO is it live products are they live How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced

The 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1 Since then 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol Limit Order Protocol P2P transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet

1inch Aggregation Protocol The 1inch API v4 Pathfinder is a cuttingedge discovery and routing algorithm which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time

1inch Liquidity Protocol 1inch Liquidity protocol previously called Mooniswap is an AMM that aims to offer capitalefficient liquidity positions while protecting users from frontrunning

1inch Limit Order Protocol 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders and RFQ Orders which later can be filled onchain Both types of orders are a data structure created offchain and signed according to EIP712 Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency

P2P Transactions 1inch PeertoPeer allows two users to make an overthecounter style trade of any ERC20 token
1inch Mobile Wallet The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a builtin DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions

Supported Networks 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks Ethereum Binance Smart Chain Polygon Arbitrum Optimism Gnosis chain Avalanche and Fantom

 How is the asset currently used

1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network Since November 2021 all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1 The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals Instant Governance or benefit from the gas refund program 3

Emission schedule

The 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4

Of the 15B total future supply 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 when the maximum supply of 15B is reached

Uncirculated 1INCH is held in onchain vesting contracts v1INCH is the nontransferable ERC20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract There are 107B v1INCH these are included in the 15B total future supply

 Token  protocol permissions and upgradability

The smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded  new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance

The 1INCH token is nonupgradable The tokens mint function previously controlled by a mutlisig was recently burned 4  there will never be more than 15B 1INCH

 General

The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1 Since then the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol Limit Order Protocol P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities the 1inch Foundation 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately

 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community The foundation issued the 1inch token however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract The 1inch Foundation holds around 2818835556 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig
 Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs
 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of onchain smart contracts The 1inch DAO has control amongst others over the 1INCH token DAO Treasury 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing
   1INCH The unstaked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals
   st1INCH A non transferable ERC20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocols governance contract This has a Voting Weight of 100 There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively
   v1INCH This is an ERC20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract These tokens are held by backers advisors and core contributors but are not yet fullyvested Each v1INCH has 15th 20 the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH

The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAOs treasury A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury

 1INCH Smart Contract Risk

The 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020 Since then it has done over 250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M

The 1INCH token is an ERC20 token with no governance influence held by around 88475 wallets and the staked INCH token st1INCH used for governance is held by around 5391 wallets The staking contract holds 2021880081 INCH tokens at the time of writing

The 1inch Foundation although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately 15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value

On April 6th 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH

 1INCH Counterparty Risk

1inch is a permissionless protocol where 1INCH holders do not have a say in how the protocol or DAO is governed

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals Instant Governance or benefit from the gas refund program

The st1INCH token is used for governing the DAO and although there is no revenue sharing like with xSUSHI there are economic rewardsincentives for those who hold the token st1INCH token holders receive up to 100 of gas expenses refunded depending on your stake size Under this program 1INCH tokens are distributed as a gas refund to Ethereum users who stake 1INCH tokens through the 1INCH dApp Borrowing 1INCH with the intent to receive a gas refund is a useful utility

Users who stake 1INCH receive st1INCH which is non transferrable and used for governance If a malicious actor was to borrow 1INCH stake to receive st1INCH and then try attack the DAOs treasury then the Treasury Multisig 7 of 12 can veto the proposal during the 72 hour timelock period post successful Snapshot vote This measure provides a level of protection for the DAOs Treasury funds which are nominated in USDC Any malicious attack on the DAO Treasury would not lead to the actor selling 1INCH onmarket and this scenario would not create bad debt by moving the spot price of 1INCH

 Paragraph Summary

LUSD is stablecoin minted directly by the protocol users by opening a Trove and depositing ETH as collateral Loans are interestfree with a 05 base initiation fee All the contracts of the Liquity protocol are immutable which makes LUSD the most trustless stablecoin currently available on the Ethereum mainnet

LUSD is overcollateralized by ETH with two main mechanisms helping it keep its peg first LUSD can be redeemed for ETH at face value ie 1 LUSD for 1 of ETH Secondly there is a minimal collateral ratio of 110 Both mechanisms respectively create a price floor and ceiling through arbitrage opportunities

Since the protocol is immutable no additional developments are planned yet the Liquity team is working on another project that will prove synergetic with LUSD

LUSDs resilience makes it a highly soughtafter stablecoin for DAOs and protocols looking to diversify their treasury and users looking for costeffective leverage on ETH The current focus is to grow the DeFi ecosystem around LUSD to enable more diverse use cases

This proposal aims to add LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave v2 mainnet 0 LTV If the current proposal is met with enthusiasm other proposals will follow suit

 Overview of the project and token

Liquity is a protocol offering costefficient leverage using ETH as collateral While its base design can be described as similar to MakerDAI there are several key differences

 Only ETH is accepted as collateral to maximize the protocols trustlessness and resilience
 There is no interest fee on Liquity Instead the borrowers pay a predictable initiation fee starting at 05  and ramping up algorithmically when needed to protect the protocol
 Liquidations are close to instant and enabled by a protocollevel backstop the stability poolhttpsdocsliquityorgfaqstabilitypoolandliquidations a reserve of LUSD deposited by users
 Just like Aave Liquity uses ChainLink as the main price feed However there is a fallback systemhttpsdocsliquityorgfaqstabilitypoolandliquidations in place switching to Tellor if the ChainLink price feed data is deemed incoherent
 Since the contracts are immutable there is no governance There is still a token associated with the protocol  LQTYhttpsetherscaniotoken0x6dea81c8171d0ba574754ef6f8b412f2ed88c54d but its used for incentivization and feesharing purposes only
 The minimal required collateralization ratio is lower  at 110 increasing the capital efficiency of the protocol This is possible thanks to the stability pool and instant liquidation mechanism which also helps maintain the peg by acting as a liquidity buffer A failsafe mechanism called the Recovery Mode is triggered when the total collateralization ratio of the protocol falls below 150 Being an exceptional measure the Recovery Mode enforces more substantial restrictions on the Troves such as temporary minimal collateralization of 150 until the total collateralization ratio of the protocol recovers So far it was only triggered once in the early days of the protocol

 Positioning within Aave Ecosystem

LUSD is a stablecoin offering some genuinely unique features the leading one being the trustlessness of the whole Liquity protocol In that sense LUSD is one of the most resilient stablecoin and the most decentralized Similar to the addition of RAI on Aave having LUSD will help Aave diversify from the current dominance of centralized stablecoins such as USDC used for borrowing

Furthermore as mentioned above this proposal is the first step Several others could follow to nurture the relationship between Aave and Liquity further

1 Enablement of LUSD as collateral LTV0
2 Enablement of efficiency mode against selected stablecoins once v3 mainnet is live
3 Addition of LUSD on AaveOptimism  potential enablement as collateral  again enablement of the efficiency mode

I believe that LUSD as a borrowable asset will be met with a strong demand it will be the first time such a resilient stablecoin could be borrowed on Aave and the first protocol where LUSD is borrowable

 History of the project and its components

The Liquity protocol was launched on the 5th of April 2021 As the code is immutable there has been no update since then However the team is still actively working on the protocol DeFi integrations such as supporting LUSD liquidity on Curve

Since the demand for LUSD is directly dependent on the appetite for leverage on ETH the LUSD supply had varied quite a bit since the launch with the highest point around 15B LUSD when ETH reached a peak price of 4K The following correction on ETH with the lowest point around 2K led to a drastic reduction in the LUSD supply  this episode is the first and so far unique time when the Recovery Mode was triggered Since this episode the supply has stabilized more and is now around 325M LUSD This episode was the first massive stress test for the Liquity Protocol which handled it gracefully  a recap is available here

Since the protocol launch various DeFi integrations have been built on top of the Liquity Protocol here are some of the most notable

 A Curve pool integration on Convex and Yearn was created against the 3Pool and became the main liquidity source Its amongst the stablecoin pools with the highest base APR due to the trading volume it processes
 DeFiSaver offers some automation features to streamline Troves management
 BProtocol delivered an autocompounder for depositors of the Stability Pool who wish to keep a 100 LUSD exposure httpsappbprotocolorgliquity
 Some protocols such as Olympus or Fei Protocol diversified part of their treasury to LUSD to shield themselves from volatility with an unstoppable stablecoin Synthetix is also using LUSD on Optimism to stabilize the sUSD price

 LUSD usage

A sizeable share of the LUSD supply 66 is deposited into the Stability Pool the liquidity backstop for liquidations httpsetherscanioaddress0x66017d22b0f8556afdd19fc67041899eb65a21bb

The top LUSD holders also include other protocols such as Olympus DXdao or some treasuries

LUSD is also present on Optimism where Synthetix provided a wrapper contract to help stabilize the sUSD price 45M LUSD  to provide liquidity on Velodrome the pool is 9M TVL against USDC

 LUSD Emission

The only way to mint LUSD is to open a Trove while LUSD is burned through debt repayment either directly by the trove owner or through redemptions by an arbitrageur

 Token  Protocol Permissions

The LUSD token as well as the whole Liquity protocol are fully permissionless There is no multisig and no governance and noone can interact with the contract underlying the protocol in an administrative manner all users are the same in front of the contract just like with Uniswap v2 for instance

 Market Data

As of June 03 the total LUSD supply is around 325M There is about 90M of total liquidity in pools where LUSD is involved

The main liquidity source for LUSD is the Curve pool with 65M TVL httpscurvefilusd

There are also liquidity sources against FRAX USDC and DAI on Uniswap V3 httpsinfouniswaporgtokens0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0

There is a 4tokens pool on Saddle Finance alUSD FEI FRAX LUSD with 25M liquidity httpssaddleexchangepoolsD4deposit

Finally on Optimism LUSD is the largest stablecoin pool with around 9M against USDC httpsappvelodromefinanceliquidity0x207addb05c548f262219f6bfc6e11c02d0f7fdbe

The observed volume can vary depending on the markets activity massive ETH price movements are usually followed by days with large volume with a baseline around 3M daily volume mainnet only

 Social channel data

The main channel for the community to gather is the Liquity Discord server with around 65K members For outwardfacing communications the main channel used is the LiquityProtocol Twitter account with over 285K followers We also regularly publish newsletter updates to subscribers 25K and have recently become more active on LinkedIn 1K

 Risk Assessment

We followed Aaves risk assessment methodologyhttpsdocsaavecomriskassetriskmethodology to provide all the necessary metrics

Im not sure what the proper rating is for a stablecoin with no governance and immutable code should be when it comes to the Permission category so I went with an A to reflect that in that regard LUSD is almost as safe as ETH Feel free to challenge me if you think that is not appropriate

 Paragraph summary
We would like to ask for your support in listing RSR Reserve Rights Token as an asset to borrow RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both a insures and b governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol

 Motivation
The Reserve team is launching the Reserve protocol in fall of 2022 From that point on the Reserve Rights RSR token will serve the purpose of a insuring and b governing stablecoins created on the Reserve protocol RTokens

The Reserve protocol GitHub  reserveprotocolprotocolhttpsgithubcomreserveprotocolprotocol is building on Aave by a integrating aTokens as collateral and b using the protocol oracle to determine price during valuation and auction functions if listed on Aave as borrowable asset

We would prefer to use the Aave oracles for the simplicity of our protocols design and the code has already been included in our ongoing audit To do so this requires RSR to be a borrowable asset on Aave

When RSR is staked on a particular Reserve stablecoin RToken it may receive a portion of income from the respective RTokens full collateral basket Because of this we anticipate demand to borrow RSR in order to stake or hedge staked positions Aave would be the only platform where this would be possible as of now

 Specifications
 Link between the author  the project 
The Reserve team
 High level overview of the project 
The mission of the Reserve project is to help people cope with the effects of high or hyperinflation and aims to eventually eradicate it The project does this by developing a stable cryptocurrencies b a mobile application to exchange local currencies with the stable cryptocurrencies and c a protocol that insures  governs them
 
imageipfsbafkreiaxl7iig3h3eceftb6qulbqugv52vmwndiv6da44y7zb6lrre6ole
The Reserve app is currently available in Latin American countries where hyperinflation has had the most significant impact Venezuela Argentina Colombia  Panama It currently has 600000 registered users and 120000 weekly app visitors who use the Reserve stablecoins for daily purchases such as paying for groceries paying bills etc This video shows how some of our customers use our stablecoin daily httpstinyurlcommudrhh4d

The Reserve Rights RSR token is the governance token used to insure the stable cryptocurrencies against collateral defaults and while staked is also used to govern the RTokens collateral changes etc

A key point is that when RSR is staked on a particular RToken it will typically  determined by governance receive a portion of the income of the entire RTokens collateral

 We define an asset as stable if it never depreciates and generally appreciates over time relative to its backing assets

 Why would RSR be a good borrow asset
We anticipate that the yield on stRSR will drive demand to borrow RSR for two primary purposes a to hedge against price changes on an existing stRSR position and b to borrow with intent to stake for the stRSR yield

These are both well known strategies in DeFi and TradFi and we dont expect that to be any different with RSR Furthermore we have received a significant amount of requests from our community but have delayed on making this request until we were closer to launching our platform

Aave would be the first and currently only place to borrow RSR in DeFi and as a result we anticipate there to be demand

By listing RSR as a borrowable asset Aave would become the first DeFi protocol that allows borrowing RSR and could therefore benefit from the borrowing demand from the RSR community and potentially other parties

 Brief history of the projects components
The main relevant components of the Reserve ecosystem are the Reserve mobile app and the Reserve Protocol

The Reserve app has been fully open access to users in the aforementioned countries since September 2021 The full version of the Reserve protocol will be live sometime in 2022 We anticipate this happening in the early Fall although as with all development work this could be a bit sooner or later

An initial concept of fully collateralized stablecoins was launched in 2019 and since then the team has been working on the fully decentralized and permissionless platform that will allow for the creation of fully collateralized yield bearing and insured stablecoins Full details on this updated version can be found here Protocol description  Reservehttpsreserveorgprotocol2021_version

 How is the asset currently used
At this point in time the Reserve Rights RSR token serves as a placeholder token From this year onward the token will be used for two main purposes
1 RSR holders can stake their RSR on any Reserve stablecoin RToken to insure it against default of one of the collateral tokens and in return may receive a portion of the yield generated by the collateral backing RTokens
2 RSR holders can govern Reserve stablecoin to help decide on its future eg collateral assets backup assets locking periods etc
 Emission schedule
The total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens out of which there are currently 183b in circulation The remaining 817b RSR tokens are locked Out of these 494b tokens belong to the Slow Wallet 155b to seed investors and strategic partners and 168b to team members and advisors

The Slow Wallethttpsetherscaniotoken0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70a0x6bab6EB87Aa5a1e4A8310C73bDAAA8A5dAAd81C1 is a locked wallet controlled by the Reserve project used to fund RToken adoption initiatives like listings partnerships marketing etc Its under the discretionary control of the Reserve team However it has a hardcoded 4week delay after initiating each withdrawal transaction on the blockchain Upon initiating a withdrawal transaction the team announces the purpose of the withdrawal either through a public onchain message or on social media If RSR holders do not agree with the purpose of the withdrawal they are able to sell their RSR in the 4week period before the project is able to sell what they have withdrawn The team can only access these withdrawn tokens after those 4 weeks

More details here Release schedulehttpsreserveorgprotocolrsr_release_schedulemaincontent

 Token  Protocol permissions minting and upgradability Is there a multisig What can it do Who are the signers
The total supply of RSR cannot be changed RSR did migrate from a V1 contract in the past and some RSR has not completed the migration yet The only minting that occurs is from migration which does not impact total supply

The contract is unupgradeable however it is pausable The pauser is set to the Reserve team multisighttpsgnosissafeioappeth0xA7b123D54BcEc14b4206dAb796982a6d5aaA6770home a 3of5 safe Pausing will only be done in situations where the token or platform is in danger Once the platform has reached steady state the team intends to release pausing to a burn address

The Aave protocol is a decentralized ecosystem of smartcontracts running on several EVM networks This ecosystem is permisionless and anyone with the required tech knowledge can freely use 100 of the Aave protocol features

That being said for a more accessible user experience the Aave companies created the Aave application 4 allowing the interaction with the Aave protocol without technical knowledge

To reinforce the decentralization of the application the Aave app is deployed on IFPS and considering Flux hosting to avoid centralization of hosting

also the Aave app is fully open source 1 and allows any developer to contribute to the improvement of the application for the benefit of the endusers

the proposed options for the snapshot must be YAENAYABSTAIN

The Aave interface GitHub maintainers will then review the integration PR and provided they dont detect security issues will merge the PR

In the case of a security issue detected with the PR and not discussed before the snapshot vote the GitHub maintainers will open technical communication channels with the entity in an effort to allow the integration to be merged but will keep a veto right regardless of the governance process in the case the integration is considered harmful to Aave users security",17.317962096476354

status Proposal
author 3SE Holdings

Simple Summary
This ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmonys Horizon Bridge

This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony while still allowing repayment of debt liquidations withdrawals and changes to the interest rates Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts

Motivation
The Aave DAO Community through the governance forum has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users Protocol and DAO Harmony Horizon bridge exploit Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1

This proposed action is a first step that will protect usersIt will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop

Specification
If passed this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony In addition passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change disabling supply and borrow as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony",10.269099351636948

Technical Documentation Bridging Bitcoin To Avalanche A Technical Overview  by Michael Kaplan  Avalanche  Jun 2022  Medium
Support Documentation Avalanche Bridge  Avalanche Support

 Summary

This is a proposal to list BTCb as a collateral asset BTCb is the bridged version of Bitcoin from the Avalanche Bitcoin bridge

 Motivation

The Avalanche Bridge has become a cornerstone piece of infrastructure for the Avalanche community introducing an innovative security model that uses Intel SGX technology to usher in a new era of bridge technology The Bitcoin bridge will allow users to directly on and offramp from the Bitcoin network and enable Bitcoin users the chance to participate in DeFi It is a seamless easy and secure process

 Driving Factors

Secure the bridge must be audited and built with securityfirst technologies
CostEffective the cost of bridging assets should be low
Fast the transaction should take the least amount of time possible
Transparent users should be informed of the transfer status at every step of the process
Intuitive users new to crypto asset transfers can easily understand the steps to use the bridge
Specifications

 What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset
The author of the AIP is a representative of the Ava Labs team

 Provide a highlevel overview of the project and the token

Ava Labs is the servicing firm behind the Avalanche blockchain Avalanche is a network that is EVM compatible and can scale both vertically and horizontally through the subnet architecture and rollups Avalanche subnets can also support custom virtual machines and many programming languages

BTCb is the Avalanche bridged version of native Bitcoin and is noncustodial and permissionless allowing for one of the best and easiest onoff ramps to the Bitcoin network

 Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem Why would it be a good asset to borrow or use as collateral

BTCb is redeemable for the native version of BTC and might be the quickest easiest and safest way to get BTC onchain As we have seen in recent times CeFi carries its own risks and BTCb allows another avenue to get BTC onchain

BTCb is already integrated into multiple DeFi protocols within the Avalanche ecosystem such as Trader Joe Platypus Finance Pangolin Benqi and Paraswap

 Provide a brief history of the project and the different components DAO is it live products are they live How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced

Avalanches primary network consisting of its XChain PChain and CChain went live a little over a year ago with onchain protocols launching around that time and since then has not had any downtime CChain is an EVMcompatible contract chain and Avalanche subnets allow for horizontal scaling into a variety of virtual machines and languages

The Avalanche Ethereum Bridge is the most popular Ethereum bridge in terms of TVL and the network has become very popular for DeFi peaking at 2nd or 3rd in terms of TVL only behind Ethereum Avalanche initially struggled to gain liquidity and traction but Avalanche Rush Avalanches liquidity mining program that took place in the Autumn of 2021 attracted both Ethereum bluechip protocols and thousands of new users Avalanche also has native stablecoins ensuring some of the bridge risks are taken away

 How is the asset currently used

Currently there is about 28M worth of BTCb bridged to Avalanche CChain Some of the top protocols with BTCb integrated include 30M of liquidity deposited in Platypus Finance the Avalanche native stableswap 26M of liquidity within the Benqi lending protocol and 14M of liquidity for the AVAXBTCb pair within the AMM Trader Joe

 Emission schedule
No emission schedule

 Token  Protocol permissions minting and upgradability Is there a multisig What can it do Who are the signers

The bridge uses Intel SGX with a total of 8 wardens and the approval structure of 6 of 8 The wardens include Ankr Blockdaemon Chainstack Protofire Avascan Ava Labs Bware Labs and Halborn BTC bridging with Avalanche Bridge is not supported with Metamask or any other wallet other than the Avalanche Core Wallet This is because the Core Wallet Extension was custom built to support Bitcoin and the Avalanche Bridge and to handle the technical problems of linking Bitcoin and EVM chains within a wallet

 How It WorksTechnical Specifications

The Bridge can be broken down into two main parts the SGX application and a set of thirdparty indexers and verifiers called Wardens The Wardens are responsible for indexing the Avalanche and Bitcoin blockchains and submitting eligible transactions to the enclave for processing The SGX application requires 3 of 4 Wardens to submit the same transaction before generating the signed transaction to process the Bridge transfer on the other network For security reasons neither the enclave nor the Wardens are directly accessible to bridge users Instead theyll explicitly whitelist each others IP addresses for direct communication In addition all communication between the Enclave and Wardens will be encrypted and verified using TLS and include an HMAC signature For relaying information to the Bridge user base each warden hosts a JSON file containing the current bridge settings assets requirements and attestation report The front end is set to disable itself if theres any discrepancy within the critical information

 Proposed Technical Parameters

BTCb is proposed to start with a 70 percent max LTV a 75 percent liquidation threshold and a 65 percent liquidation penalty With the level of onchain liquidity and the ability to bridge from BTCb back to native BTC quickly and exchange on centralized exchanges for native Avalanche stablecoins these parameters are safe",19.037206370910027

title ARC Extend the Safety Module Protection to Aave V2 Arc

 Simple Summary

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module SM protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested

 Abstract

The Safety Module is a 700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users Its a unique mechanism within DeFi that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market As a result not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection

As new markets hold more risk at launch they are initially excluded from the SM protection Today most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO they seem fit for SM protection

 Motivation

The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market As new markets hold additional risk these are not initially protected by the SM However once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months the risks are significantly lower Furthermore the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2

Overall these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market This implies that in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers

Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers lps on these markets By reducing the risk for lps it is expected to lead to further growth of the markets TVL overtime Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets lps are treated more equally across the markets

The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets In the case of Aave markets on other chains the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure and not failures caused by the chains themselves PolygonAvax With regards to the Aave Arc Market Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAOs stated risk parameters should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance

These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem In particular the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive Today most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon while just about 100k on Ethereum V2 These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections in a shorter time period

The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market As new markets hold additional risk these are not initially protected by the SM However once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months the risks are significantly lower Furthermore the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2

Overall these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market This implies that in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers

Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers lps on these markets By reducing the risk for lps it is expected to lead to further growth of the markets TVL overtime Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets lps are treated more equally across the markets

The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets In the case of Aave markets on other chains the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure and not failures caused by the chains themselves PolygonAvax With regards to the Aave Arc Market Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAOs stated risk parameters should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance

These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem In particular the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive Today most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon while just about 100k on Ethereum V2 These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections in a shorter time period

Aave Companies is proposing to the DAO the introduction of GHO which was outlined in this initial proposal 

 
With community approval GHO can be launched on the Aave Protocol allowing users to mint GHO against their supplied collaterals   
  
GHO can be minted by users against a diversified set of cryptoassets Borrowers of GHO will continue earning interest on the underlying supplied collateral just as in all other borrow transactions on the Aave Protocol   
  

If approved the introduction of GHO will provide benefits for the community via the AaveDAO by sending 100 of interest payments on GHO borrows to the DAO  
  

If approved and implemented through an AIP GHO will be administered by Aave governance  
 
It will be up to the AaveDAO to decide whether they are willing to support Aave Companies for the costs and work associated with GHO 
 
 Community Feedback 
 
The community was very engaged with the GHO proposal providing incredibly helpful and informative feedback 
 

Some of the most notable feedback includes but is not limited to 
 

 Attention to potential pitfalls around DAOset interest rates 

 The importance of supply caps 

 The value that a peg stability module could bring 

 The necessity for properly vetting potential facilitators 

 

This snapshot if approved will assign the Ethereum V2 Market on the Aave Protocol as the first facilitator for GHO whilst also greenlighting the GHO proposal more generally allowing for audits to take place in the context of broad community approval It will be followed by a separate proposal that outlines a proposed strong starting state for GHO which incorporates and builds upon the aforementioned feedback while helping to ensure that GHO is community driven from the getgho 

  

 Snapshot  
  

This preliminary Snapshot vote serves to  
  
 Receive community approval for the pursuit of the GHO project  

 Whitelist the Aave V2 Ethereum Market as the first facilitator for GHO 
 Signal community approval to kick off discussions around starting parameters 

 

Our proposal for this starting state will be informed by community feedback regarding the initial proposal and will aim to provide a strong initiation point for the AaveDAO to oversee GHOs development and parameters moving forward",18.637968310501567
377," Simple Summary

This Snapshot vote establishes community consensus on whether
1 New assets are not required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0 or
2 New assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0


 Motivation


Since Gauntlet began its partnership with the Aave protocol we have received requests from the Community to analyze asset listings Community members developers and other stakeholders often asked us questions like how much liquidity should this asset have before being listed What should the assets initial parameters be How do we protect the protocol from insolvency 

Gauntlets framework focuses specifically on market risk and how Gauntlet will support the asset listing process in Aave Our framework can be found herehttpswwwnotionsogauntletAaveAssetListingFrameworkMarketRisk7c29d448924f444abfa9681410c707c3 This will work in conjunction with Aaves existing asset listing frameworkhttpsdocsaavecomgovernanceguidesnewassetlisting 

Listing assets is essential to the growth of the protocol As new assets in DeFi proliferate and older assets fall out of favor Aave must list and delist assets to maintain its usefulness as a protocol Gauntlet will conduct these risk assessments prior to new assets being listed given 2 weeks of notice and strong community buyin

Notably we recommend that LTV and Liquidation Threshold be set to 0 on the initial listing In other words assets will not be allowed to be used as collateral upon their initial listing 

Historically the community has listed assets with nonzero LTV and Liquidation Threshold Because there are risks in doing so this Snapshot vote helps the community align on best practices moving forward


 Specification

Community input is valuable because requiring that assets are listed with an initial LTV of 0 imposes important tradeoffs

1 Not requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0 can potentially allow the asset to have more utility depending on the asset from the onset of listing Thus the protocol may be earning revenue at the onset of the listing driven by increased borrows However when assets are enabled as collateral from the initial listing the protocol immediately faces the technical and market risks inherent in adding another risk vector to the protocol The protocol is only as strong as its weakest link
2 Requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0 can protect the protocol from unforeseen mechanism smart contract and other technical risks In addition setting an initial LTV of 0 allows the protocol to observe how supply and borrow usage as well as liquidity conditions evolve following the asset listing This data enables more robust risk analysis and finetuning of LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters following the initial asset listing The tradeoff is that until an asset is enabled as collateral usage may be limited depending on the asset and thus the protocol faces an opportunity cost of revenue We view this as a minuscule opportunity cost eg a few weeks of revenue attributable to the asset relative to the risks Assets can be turned on as collateral but being turned off as collateral is a more difficult process with increased user friction


Option 1 above should not be interpreted as suggesting that all assets should be enabled as collateral It simply allows for the possibility that assets can be listed with an initial nonzero LTV should the community deem the asset a collateral asset

Should the community favor Option 2 assets should be listed with an initial LTV of 0 and a separate proposal must be proposed by the community at some point after the initial listing to enable the asset as collateral At that point in time given strong community buyin Gauntlet will conduct market risk analysis to recommend LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters

 Next Steps


 This Snapshot vote has the below options
1 Not all assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0
2 All assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0 After 23 weeks of operation as a noncollateral asset the community can propose turning it on as collateral At that point Gauntlet will make parameter recommendations as per our Notion document below

A proposal to adjust five 5 total risk parameters including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across three 3 Aave V2 assets 



 Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the Moderate risk levelhttpssnapshotorgaaveethproposalQmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi chosen by the Aave community These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data outlined below to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV The community has aligned on a Risk Off Frameworkhttpssnapshotorgaaveethproposalbafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4 regarding lowering liquidation thresholds 


 Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk tradeoffs between specific assets

Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics insolvencies liquidations and borrow usage Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function Our agentbased simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis including but not limited to asset volatility asset correlation asset collateral usage DEX  CEX liquidity trading volume expected market impact of trades and liquidator behavior Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics As such the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation The individual collateral pages on the Gauntlet Risk Dashboardhttpsgovgauntletnetworkaave cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations

Title ARFC Cancel Llama Service Provider Stream 
Author Marc Zeller marczeller  AaveChan Initiative
Date 20230730


 Summary

This ARFC proposes to cancel the Llama stream from the Aave DAO

 Motivation

Llama has historically been a service provider for the Aave DAO and has made numerous contributions However during their tenure there have been several instances where Llamas performance has fallen short of expectations 

For instance

 Llamas handling of the crucial CRV AIP was a clear demonstration of their inability to deliver a muchneeded payload in a timely manner The delay in execution resulted in an additional cost of approximately 1 million for the DAO due to the increased valuation of CRV This incident underscores the need for service providers who can reliably deliver on their commitments and highlights Llamas underqualification for the task at hand
 Despite receiving 15 million from the DAO Llama charged third parties for consulting services related to Aave including teams seeking asset listings
 As treasury managers Llama failed to ensure that the collector contract had an adequate aUSDC balance This oversight resulted in several service providers going unpaid for weeks tarnishing the DAOs brand and reputation

Given these circumstances we believe that the most beneficial course of action for the Aave DAO is to end our relationship with Llama This will allow the DAO to reassess its needs and budget for a new service provider

The ACI and other service providers will complete any outstanding tasks from Llamas engagement at no additional cost to the DAO

By terminating Llamas stream early the DAO treasury can save up to approximately 240k These funds can then be reallocated to other initiatives ensuring the most efficient use of the DAOs resources


 Specification

The AIP will call the cancelStream method of the Ecosystem Reserve and Aave Collector contracts The details are as follows

 Ecosystem Reserve Contract 0x25F2226B597E8F9514B3F68F00f494cF4f286491

Title ARFC BUSD Offboarding Plan Part III
Author Marc Zeller marczeller  Aave Chan Initiative
Date 20230725


 Summary

This ARFC proposal outlines the third part of the offboarding plan for BUSD on the Aave V2 Ethereum market The plan aims to further reduce the amount of liquidity in BUSD and encourage users to switch to other stablecoins The plan involves modification of BUSD risk parameters and withdrawal of aBUSD from the collector contract The plan will be enforced in a single AIP

 Motivation

Please refer to the first and second parts of the BUSD offboarding plan for more context The first two parts of the plan were successful driving out liquidity and incentivizing active users to repay their debt and move their position to other stablecoins The remaining vBUSD debt holders seem to be inactive or unaffected by high rates due to the timesensitive nature of BUSDPaxos situation and the potential risk of protocol bad debt

This third part of the offboarding plan will concentrate efforts on creating unsustainable positions for remaining borrowers to either motivate them enough to repay or reach liquidation thresholds

Both actions are proposed to be performed

 Modify risk parameters to force slope 2 interest rate curve and increase slope 2 aggressiveness
 Remove aBUSD from the collector contract to increase the utilization ratio of BUSD and increase the cost of open positions

 Specification

The offboarding plan will be carried out in a single AIP with the following parameters

 Parameter  Value 
    
 uOptimal  1 
 Reserve Factor  999 
 Base Rate  100 
 Slope 1  70 
 Slope 2  300 

This will result in a 470 APR cost at 100 utilization rate

Withdrawal of aBUSD from the collector contract The BUSD will be kept as such in the collector contract and a separate AIP will organize the swap of BUSD into other assets at a later stage

 Title ARFC OP Risk Parameters Update for Aave V3 Optimism Pool

 Author Marc Zeller marczeller  Aave Chan Initiative

 Date 20230825



 Summary

This ARFC proposes the activation of OP as a borrowable asset in the Aave V3 Optimism pool The aim is to adapt to the maturity of the L2 and attract more suppliers and borrowers thereby generating new revenue for the protocol

 Motivation

The Aave OP V3 market is one of the Aave V3 L2 deployments with OP being the native asset of the OP L2 At its inception the L2 was in its early stages leading to the onboarding of OP with conservative parameters due to nascent liquidity  infrastructure 

As the L2 has matured the ACI proposes less conservative parameters for the OP asset By removing the isolation mode for OP and allowing its borrowing we anticipate attracting more suppliers who can earn a yield on their OP deposits and new borrowers who can use OP to borrow additional assets This will also generate new revenue for the protocol 

While the proposed changes are less conservative they still maintain strict supply borrow caps and a conservative interest rate strategy This ensures that the DAO promotes growth and new opportunities while remaining riskaverse Based on the collected market data postimplementation the community will have the opportunity to revisit these parameters at a later stage

title ARFC Safety Module  Polygon  Avalanche Coverage Update
author TokenLogic
created 20230903



 Summary

This publication proposes updating the Safety Module SM coverage across the various iterations of Aave Protocol on Polygon and Avalanche networks

SM coverage is to be removed from Polygon v2 and Avalanche v2 deployments and extended to Avalanche v3

 Motivation

With the continued migration of users from v2 to v3 this publication seeks to further encourage users to migrate by removing the SM coverage for Aave v2 deployments on the Polygon and Avalanche networks

During 2023 the total market size on Avalanche and Polygon Aave v2 Protocol deployments has been trending lower At the time of writing the total market size of Aave v2 on Avalanche and Polygon is 362M and 1347M respectively For comparison the Aave v3 deployment on each network is 1998M and 2299M respectively 

By removing SM coverage for Avalanche and Polygon v2 deployments Aave DAO will no longer be providing coverage for the outdated iterations of Aave Protocol with exception of the Aave ARC deployment By removing the SM coverage users are further encouraged to migrate to v3

The Polygon Aave v3 deployment is already covered by the SM whilst the Avalanche v3 deployment is not cover by the SM This publication seeks to extend the SM coverage to include Avalanche v3 Therefore both v3 iterations are covered by the SM and v2 iterations are not covered on Polygon and Avalanche 

For reference at the time of writing the following Aave Protocol deployments are covered by the SM

 Specification

It is important to note based upon the current implementation of the SM an adhoc AIP is required to implement a Shortfall Event

The following Snapshot votes will be created to enable granular voting

 Extend SM Coverage to Avalanche v3
 Remove SM Coverage for Polygon v2
 Remove SM Coverage for Avalanche v2

Upon conclusion of the Snapshot vote if approved SM coverage will be removedextended to the respective market

There is no need for an AIP to implement this upgrade

389," Summary

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V3 Ethereum For more details see the full forum post herehttpsgovernanceaavecomtarfcupgradeaavev3ethpoolwethparameters15110


 Motivation

The current yields of stETH and reth have been observed at 33 and 307 respectively By adjusting the slope1 parameter of WETH we aim to

 Enhance Profitability in Leverage Loops The proposed adjustment will make leverage loops more profitable for users
 Align with stETH and reth Yields The adjustment aims to set the slope1 slightly below the current yields of stETH and reth ensuring Aave remains competitive

Increased utilization of ETH reserve is expected to partly compensate for the slight loss of protocol revenue due to lower interest rate equilibrium





 Specification

We propose two options for the weth slope1 parameters

 Option 1 Conservative Set slope1 to 32 10 bps below stETH yield but above rETH yield
 Option 2 Aggressive Set slope1 to 28 50 below stETH yield  23bps below rETH yield allowing both to be profitable

Additionally we propose reducing the optimalRatio to 80 to mitigate liquidity risks

title ARFC sDAI Onboarding on Aave V3 Gnosis Pool
author marczeller  Aavechan Initiative
date 09102023


 Summary

This ARFC proposes the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain Pool With the imminent deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain and the recent deployment of sDAI we believe this integration will further enhance the utility and liquidity of the Aave ecosystem on Gnosischain

 Motivation

 Aave V3 Gnosischain Deployment The deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain is on the horizon As outlined in the Gnosischain deployment ARFChttpsgovernanceaavecomtarfcaavev3deploymentongnosischain14695 sDAI was identified as a prime collateral candidate for Aave However at the time of the proposals creation sDAI had not been deployed
  
 Rapid Growth of sDAI Since its deployment sDAI has shown significant traction attracting 46M in just a few days This demonstrates the communitys trust and the potential of sDAI as a collateral asset in the Aave ecosystem
  
 Technical  Timeframe Considerations We propose the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain deployment either as part of the initial deployment or through a subsequent onboarding AIP depending on whats most optimal from both a technical and timeframe perspective

 Specification

 Asset sDAI
 Contract Address 0xaf204776c7245bF4147c2612BF6e5972Ee483701

A Price sync adapter oracle considering both wxDAI value and sDAI exchange rate will be implemented as a Price feed for this asset

 Risk Parameters

title ARFC Treasury Management  Add to rETH Holding
author TokenLogic  MatthewGraham  DefiJesus  ACI  MarcZeller 
created 20231014



 Summary

This publication proposes acquiring rETH with ETH held in the DAOs Ethereum Treasury

 Abstract

This publication proposes converting a portion of the wETH awETH and wEthWETH held in the Treasury to rETH

A balance of 100 aEthWETH will remain in the Treasury to facilitate on going DAO expenses such as the Quarterly Gas Rebatehttpsgovernanceaavecomtarfcquarterlygasrebatedistributionaugust202314680 and any other future expense that arise

 Motivation

At the time of writing the Aave DAO has the following assets in the Ethereum Treasury

AssetQty Value 
      
wETH 1456 2254332
awETH5303982082960
aEthWETH51045  78996205

The following assets are available to be claimed from the Paraswap Legacy Fees and Fee Claimer contract

AssetQty Value 
      
wETH 453 701199
wETH 108 1671732

This publication proposes converting all wETH awETH and all but 100 aEthWETH to rETH The 100 aEthWETH is to remain to support on going DAO funding 

The table below shows the yield differential between the various assets

AssetYield  
     
wETH 000
awETH126
aEthWETH197 
rETH307

Based upon current market conditions the additional yield generated by converting the assets as outlined to rETH is 2326650 

Upon implementation of this ARFChttpsgovernanceaavecomtarfcupgradeaavev3ethpoolwethparameters15110 the additional yield generated is 65442 for the conservative and 278286 for the aggressive approach due to the reduction in deposit rates of approximately 103 bps and 335bps respectively This does not take into consideration how the market will then adjust after the ETH v3 interst rate parameters are changed 

 Specification

The following is to be performed

 Deposit all wETH into aEthWETH Aave V3 wETH
 Withdraw all awETH Aave V2 wETH into ETH
 Withdraw all but 100 aEthWETH Aave V3 wETH into ETH
 Deposit ETH into RocketPools rETH
 Transfer rETH into collector

Title ARFC BGD Security budget request  December 2023

Author BGD Labs bgdlabs

Date 2023128



 Summary
Request for a budget of 121200 for 2 security review procedures on Aave together with a refund of 30000 to BGD for the Aave Governance v3 extra voting tokens auditA


Amounting a grand total of 151200


 Motivation
Part of our scope Aave  BGD Phase IIhttpsgovernanceaavecomtaaveboredghostsdevelopingphase214484scope6 is the planning engagement and coordination with security partners of the DAO

During the previous year and a half Aave was in a pretty intensive delivery phase Aave v3 improvements GHO Aave Governance v3 aDI and we thought it was appropriate to have continuous engagement with 2 security firms like Certora and SigmaPrime

Even if this worked well and we still think that Certora should stay with a continuous engagementhttpsgovernanceaavecomtarfccontinuoussecurityproposalaavecertora157324 we also think that there is room for optimisation and it is a good idea to do more adhoc requests for the security budget depending on the needs

This ARFC is an initial request for budget required in the short term on item part of our development services scope together with another more general we consider pretty important

 Specification
This request has 3 components which we want to explain to the community



1 Compensation for Mixbytes review of Governance v3 tokens

During the activation of Aave Governance v3 on October 17th we detected a problem with the voting assets which required the cancellation of the proposal the development of a fix and reapply security procedures

Given that it was already audited code we also decided to do an extra security review by another security firm Mixbytes

For the sake of speed and reducing bureaucratic blockers BGD paid for the cost of said security review of 30000 and now we will include on this proposal a refund request for that amount



2 Compensation for security review on a feature of Aave 31

Also part of our Phase 2 scope is to do a series of improvements to Aave v3 in order to reach a 31 version from the current 302

Generally we are confident with Certora reviewing all the planned items until now but there is one exception an specific feature to which we thought an extra review was required and we engaged Emanuele Ricci StErMi a toplevel security researcher with knowledge of Aave to do it
We will be publishing soon everything to be included into v31

Same as with Mixbytes BGD has paid the cost of said security review of 12000 and now we include the refund request on this proposal



3 Engagement with Spearbit for Aave v3 adhoc review

Aave v2v3 is a production system with billions of dollars in size and one of the most evaluated protocols securitywise
However security is a continuous process and always worth it to improve whenever it feels necessary

During the last 12 months we have noticed different security exploits in the space following similar patterns None of them affected Aave but apart from our continuous analysis of the system securitywise we think it is necessary to do an extra round of review in critical parts of Aave for additional assurance

We have coordinated an engagement for this review scope with Spearbit one of the leading security firms in the space that will involve 3 of their top researchers checking indepth different components that we identify as critical on Aave

This engagement is scheduled to start in the second part of December and different from the others the payment requested in the proposal will be direct to Spearbit for an amount of 109200



From a technical perspective
 The proposal will send 42000 to BGD as compensation for the expenses of part 1 and 2
 109200 will be sent to a Spearbit wallet to compensate for the services to be provided on part 3

The final addresses and stablecoins of the treasury to use will be included in the AIP stage previous coordination about the last with contributors to the financial area of the Aave DAO",12.957159133111846

Title ARFC  Retroactive bug bounties proposal preImmunefi

Author BGD Labs bgdlabs

Date 20240109



 Summary

Request for bounties pending from before the setup of the Aave  Immunefi official bug bounty program amounting a grand total of 86500

The objective of this ARFC is to preauthorise such payments to be processed via an onchain AIP

 Motivation

Before the setup of the Aave  Immunefi bug bounty program on September 25th 2023httpsgovernancev2aavecomgovernanceproposal325 security reports by white hats where evaluated in an adhoc basis proposing bountiesrewards following an approach like on this proposalhttpsgovernanceaavecomtbgdbugbountiesproposal13077 That was not optimal as there was no formal scope defined or strict ranges of bounties depending on severity and impact

Currently every report is being processed via Immunefi and the rules of the Aave program however there were other reports submitted via other channel before that usually securityaavecom As these reports should be evaluated at time of submission for fairness and outside of the Immunefi scope defined afterwards we think it is a good idea to reward them separately and retroactively outside the program

 Specification

 Reports

First of all we want to clarify certain aspects for the community

 The proposed rewards and evaluation metrics follow the ones we did adhoc in the past HEREhttpsgovernanceaavecomtbgdbugbountiesproposal13077clarificationonevaluation2 as we dont think it is fair for the whitehats to apply the rewards ranges on the current Immunefi program and outofscope rules as they were defined afterwards
 In one of the cases we recommended the white hat to submit the report via Immunefi in order to have access to the mediation procedure of the platform As this mediation process was finally requested by the white hat Immunefi charges the corresponding fee of 10 of the amount which we think is legitimate
 At the moment we are not disclosing the full details of some of the reports because even if none of them create any risk for Aave now one has dependencies with another report not disclosed yet and the other could increase risk to nonAave entities


 1 Inconsistent validation on  Aave v2v3

When calling borrow with stable rate mode on Aave v2 and v3 one of the validations is that not more than a percentage of the total available liquidity can be borrowed at once

However swapBorrowRateMode doesnt validate the same which is unexpected and could lead to more stable rate borrowings than intended

It is important to highlight that this is not possible at the moment with minting of stable rate disabled


Severity  Low

The issue didnt create any immediate problem in the protocol but overexposure to stable rate mode is not expected

Likelihood  Certain

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3 on those assets with stable rate enabled

Proposed bounty 10000 USD



 2 Inconsistent HF Health Factor behaviour swap borrow rate mode

When swapping borrow rate mode the HF of an user is not validated as debt should remain the same However under edge scenarios the HF of an user could slightly change by 1 unit of lowest assets decimals


Severity  No impact

This is not a bug or creates any exploit scenario but it is unexpected behaviour

Likelihood  Certain

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3 on those assets with stable rate enabled

Proposed bounty 5000 USD



 3 Price manipulation of asset listed on Aave

By executing a complex strategy involving compromising the assets trusted infrastructure it could be possible to inflate the price of one of the assets listed on Aave v2

Even if this belongs more to the centralisation risk of the asset and we dont consider a bug of the protocol it was taken into account for offboarding consideration of the asset by risk providers of Aave and we believe it is fair to reward retroactively

As this risk still exist on the asset itself and more protocols could be using it even if we dont really see any immediate risk we will not be disclosing at the moment details of it until the team applies extra measures


Severity  Critical

Being a price manipulation the impact on the protocol would hypotetically be important

Likelihood Not likely

The attack involves compromising assets infrastructure which would directly disqualify on the current Aave  Immunefi program together with extra techniques so we consider it theoretically possible but highly improbable

Proposed bounty 65000 USD Additionally 6500 USD as Immunefi fee

 Next steps

If this ARFC is positive afterwards we will proceed with an onchain governance proposal releasing the funds to the corresponding addresses",11.325572408350293

Title ARFC Chaos Labs  Update WETH IR on V3 Arbitrum and Optimism  02162024 
Author Chaos Labs
Date 20240216



 Simple Summary

Decrease slope1 on Arbitrum and Optimism from 33 to 3

 Motivation

Over the last eight months we have observed a dropoff in WETH interest rates on Ethereum and thus relative demand for ETH borrowing

Time series of WETH borrow APY on Ethereum Arbitrum and Optimism in addition to stETH APY


Note that the red dotted line indicates the point when the base_fee decreased from 1 to 0 on Arbitrum and Optimism This phenomenon can be explained by the dropoff in ETH staking yield as we can deduce through the relatively strong correlation between WETH borrow APY and stETH staking APY on Ethereum due to profitable looping strategies Additionally given Aave prices stETHETH 11 with the underlying exchange rate minimal liquidation risk exists in potential wstETH market price movements

Correlation Between stETH APY and WETH APY

Crosscorrelation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag

Computing the crosscorrelation between the three markets we notice an approximately 1week lag when this hits the maximum value implying the speed at which the borrow rates are maximally reflected in the staking APY

This is statistically significant as we can see below where 8590 of all WETH debt is backed by ETH LSTs on the respective chain

 stETH APY Differential vs WETH Borrow APY

Interestingly enough one might think that as stETH yields decrease looping strategies would become less profitable However upon analyzing the difference between the stETH APY and WETH borrow APY stETH APY  WETH APY alongside the stETH APY itself at a given time t a negative correlation emerges with the peak occurring at a 2week lag Essentially this means that the rate of decrease in borrow APY over time outpaces that of the stETH APY Thus we can conclude that when stETH APYs are high borrowers attempt to extract as much revenue as possible leading to convergence at lower yields On the contrary when stETH APYs are low borrowers and ETH borrow APYs tend to be less aggressive with looping perhaps due to theoretical scaling in the interest rate requiring smaller growth to become unprofitable leading to the effective yield scaling higher than instances when stETH APYs are high This in turn leads to less efficient markets and larger spreads when ETH staking yields are low

WETH Utilization Rates

 
imageipfsbafkreihjpcivhoywbhley2ysf4zaaa7nqmkqtsx7f3rt33dvphemir6w4u
    
WETH Utilization rate time series

Based on the observed trend its evident that Arbitrum and Optimism could benefit from a reduction in slope1 to enhance utilization rates and consequently increase revenues While the decrease in base_rate on both chains did positively impact utilization it remains suboptimal Thus we simply take the P95 of the stETH APY differential vs WETH borrow APY since the base_rate decrease which returned 06 to derive the decrease in slope1 Considering the Uoptimal rate is projected to be below the current stETH APY with a 06 variance any prolonged convergence above Uoptimal could lead to interest rate volatility In such a scenario it would be prudent to revert slope1 However given the current trend and staking APY this adjustment would likely result in higher utilization rates and greater profits for the Aave DAO

Assuming convergence at todays WETH interest rates

   Arbitrum  Optimism 
      
 Old Utilization Rate  6869  65 
 New Utilization Rate  765  72 
 Projected Revenue Increase  1362 ETH 385k year  4 ETH 113k year 

We note that adjusting WETH slope1 on other nonEthereum chains with this intuition is seen as irrelevant as either the market itself portrays too small a sample size with minimal relative demand for ETH LSTs as collateral there does not exist ETH LSTs on the chain or ETH LST supply caps have been at max capacity for months

Title ARFC Stablecoin Harmonization and Asset Parameters Optimization 
Author ACI Aave Chan Initiative
Date 20240103


 Simple Summary

This ARFC proposes focusing stablecoin collateral usage on USDT and USDC while setting LTV to zero for lesstrafficked stablecoins and longtail assets The objective is to minimize risk for the protocol optimize revenue generation and align with market demand trends

 Motivation

Aaves revenue primarily comes from wETH borrowing and stablecoins borrowing Years of User behavior data in DeFi indicates a low demand for fluctuating assets as collateral except in usecasespecific scenarios LSTLRT loops for Weth RPL borrow to deploy mini pools Based on ChaosLabs  datahttpscommunitychaoslabsxyzaaveriskmarketsEthereumlistedassets only 24 37 and 58 of supplied DAI USDT and USDC on Ethereum are being utilized as collateral We can also note that market demand for alternative stablecoins is less sensitive to borrow rates compared to bluechip stablecoins like USDT and USDC


The DAO governance has been lenient in onboarding some collaterals such as KNC which currently attracts nearly zero traction currently used to generate 079 of borrow volume and generates minimal revenue Additionally the asymmetric risk presented by stablecoins such as during the CRV event collateral was USDC with very high LT and low LB highlights the need for optimization considering Riskreward

 Specification

 Proposed Adjustments

The ACI proposes the following strategy shift

1 Focus on USDT and USDC as primary stablecoin collaterals
2 Set LTV to zero for alternative stablecoins and long tail assets
3 Enable a 3week LT reduction for these stablecoins assets providing ample time for users to react and keep them as passive yield sources or borrowable assets that represent 99 of current user demand and most of protocol revenue
4 Propose the following adjusted standardized ReserveFactor categories for Aave assets

 Collateral Type  Reserve Factor  
    
 wETH  15 
 USDCUSDT  10 
 Alternative stablecoins  long tail assets  20 
 DAI  25 

5 Fade out as collateral the following stablecoins 

 FRAX
 LUSD
 EURS
 agEUR
 JEUR
 MAI

6 freeze if not already then slowly offboard the following alternative stablecoins and longtail assets that failed to gain traction by gradually increasing RF to 999 decreasing LT by 3 per week then applying incremental interestRateStrategies incentivizing users to switch to others collaterals or borrowed asset as the DAO implemented for BUSD and TUSD on Aave V2

This publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee with 500k GHO to continue supporting GHOs liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next 3 months

 Motivation

Since its initial funding in October 2023httpsgovernancev2aavecomgovernanceproposal343 the Aave Liquidity Committee previously GLC has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes by deploying and incentivising liquidity pools
 
As a result of these efforts

 Deeper onchain liquidity
 Lower slippage especially for GHO to USDC swaps

In combination with other efforts like stkGHO ALCs initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHOs peg recovery

Throughout the period the ALC leveraged on both Uniswap v3 and more frequently Maverick to tailor liquidity distribution at specific price ranges which helped absorb GHO downward market volatility A list of active Boosted Positions can be found herehttpsappmavxyzboostedpositionschain1

While some pools are incentivised by voting with preexisting DAO holdings eg vlAURA others like Mavericks concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses It is worth noting the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick We expect Maverick and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3 to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience

Concentrated GHO liquidity was recently introduced in BalancerhttpstwittercomGyroStablestatus1757365157917815001 with the creation of several ECLP pools These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAOs vlAURA holding When there is excess vlAURA votes these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70 APR nominated in USDC 

The following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHOs ecosystem highlights

 GHOUSDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume 
     02 bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period
     01 bin width pool is starting to replace the 02 bin width pool trading volume This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 01 bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility 
  GHOUSDCUSDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP
      Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by other protocolshttpstwittercomMatthew_Graham_status1762076544241955070 and leveraged farming is introduced
 Gyrsocope ECLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks
      As the peg improves one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg

The next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas

 100100 peg with USD 
 Reducing price volatility
 Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations
 Grow non stablecoinpaired liquidity pools
 Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases

These efforts will need to scale to match GHOs expected growth profile The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future as well as participation in the launch of various projects like Ethenahttpsappethenafiliquidity and fx Protocols launchhttpsxcomprotocol_fxstatus1762822716854354015s20 

Though there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates price volatility and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations we believe a highlevel budget will look like the following

 Objective  Category  Budget   
        
 Liquidity  Peg Resilience  360k GHO 
 DeFi Integrations   Create Utility    140k GHO 
Total  500k GHO

It is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum

 Performance Indicators

The below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking

 Description Optimal Value
      
 TVL DEX Liquidity Pools  50M 
 TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools   15M excl stkGHO  
 DEX Liquidity Composition   50 GHO  33 for 3pools  
 Swap Price Impact 5M Swap   010  GHO to USDC
 Annualised Peg Volatility   500  
 Price level for  90 time    0995 using Redstone Medium PricehttpsappredstonefinanceapptokenGHO  

Please note each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next 3 months on the assumption the Borrow Cap is continually increased beyond the current 35M Bucket Size Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve

The stkGHO implementationhttpsappaavecomstaking USDe integrationhttpsappethenafiliquidity and coordinated efforts to attract users to acquire GHO are all great examples of how growth initiatives drive GHO utility adoption and have a positive impact the spot price 

Each of the above metrics plus more will be shown on the TokenLogic analytics dashboard

Title ARFC Emission Manager Framework Update 
Author ACI Aave Chan Initiative
Date 20240308


 Motivation

In the current market dynamic with incentives programs becoming increasingly popular among protocols looking to collaborate the existing framework for adding new emission managers to Aave pool reserves is considered unnecessary complex and lengthy Given the general consensus in favor of incentives programs it is challenging to consider a proposal that would fail to gain community support

The current onboarding process involves

 Step  Duration  Description 
      
 Publish ARFC on forum  5 days  Seek feedback from the community 
 Snapshot vote  4 days  Gather consensus and obtain a YAE outcome 
 AIP publication  5 days  Reach consensus and implement the new role 

Assuming perfect sync and seamless governance this minimum twoweek timeframe is deemed inefficient To address these challenges we propose updating the framework to incorporate emission admins into the DirecttoAIP framework

 Specification

 Proposed Changes

1 Incorporate emission admins into the DirecttoAIP framework enabling direct escalation of proposals to the AIP stage following publication on the forum
2 Preauthorize the inclusion of an emission admin as part of either an adhoc steward or current risk steward role to facilitate a more efficient and streamlined onboarding process

 Next Steps

1 Community feedback and gather consensus on the proposed changes
2 Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check
3 If successful escalate to AIP Aave Improvement Proposal stage for implementation

 ARFCAddendum  Update Boosters  diluters for Merit Round 2

 Author  ACI Aave Chan Initiative

 Date 20240403



 Simple Summary

This ARFCAddendum proposes to make booster  diluters evolve inside Merit to adapt to the DeFi ecosystem landscape evolution introducing new diluters  removing a booster action

 Motivation

Merit wETH has been a clear success with nearly 200k ETH leaving other protocols to join Aave V3 160k ETH specifically left Morpho V3 to join aave forcing a rebalance and has made Morpho the second largest borrower  fee payer 11 of wETH in Aave forcing them to pay north of 1600 ETH to the aave DAO per year

httpsetherscaniotoken0xeA51d7853EEFb32b6ee06b1C12E6dcCA88Be0fFEbalances

Merit GHO has also been a success and reinforced our Safety module 17M secondary liquidity and peg It allows the DAO to restart GHO minting while keeping the peg in check

GHO is expected to provide 10 of all DAO overall revenue by next week

However we have to witness less collaborative behavior from some ecosystem actors In light of this it seems suboptimal for the Aave DAO to reward uncollaborative protocols  behaviors

This is why we suggest stopping any subsidies to the makerDAO ecosystem the Aave DAO has already paid millions via the AAVE and thirdparty LM programs and has been repaid by creating competitive forks and activating D3M in a protocol that has stolen millions of revenue from this DAO with no safety track record using a market sensible collateral

With this proposal a single  in Morpho Blue or Spark will nullify any Merit Airdrop for the user
sDAI is considered a makerDAO product not a Spark product holding simply sDAI or having it in Aave will not dilute a user

This proposal aims to be enabled for Merit Round 2 and all subsequent rounds

 Specification

 Proposed Changes

 Conservative Option

1 Remove MakerDAO fren Boosters for the usage of sDAI as collateral

 Aggresive Option

1 Remove MakerDAO fren Boosters for the usage of sDAI as collateral
2 Include Morpho Blue  Spark users in the User of NonAligned Protocol diluter

 Next Steps

1 If this proposal reaches a consensus on Snapshot update the Merit reward system accordingly

Title ARFC Polygon v2 Borrow Rate Adjustments
Author karpatkey_TokenLogic  ChaosLabs 
Created 20240404



 Summary

This publication proposes gradually revising the Borrow Rate on Polygon v2 to provide further encouragement for users to migrate to Aave v3

 Motivation

Over the last 8 monthshttpsgovernancev2aavecomgovernanceproposal284 the Reserve Factor RF on Polygon v2 has gradually increased from as low as 2100 to 9999 As a result deposit yield converged to zero and the capital efficiency of Aave v2 has been reduced on Polygon

With the RF now approaching the maximum across all reserves this publication seek to gradually increase the cost of capital via periodic borrow rate adjustments every two weeks in a predictable fashion

Based upon recent borrow rates behaviour the market has demonstrated the ability to withstand periods of elevated borrowing rates 

 Non Frozen Assets

For nonfrozen assets this proposal recommends increasing the Slope1 parameter by 75bps every two weeks or 15 per month to encourage further migration of users from v2 to v3 The outcome of this votehttpssnapshotorgaaveethproposal0xe2dd228640c3cad93f5418c40c4b5743b3c6c85aa0aae9eee53cbdbca2ed5c2d has been taken into consideration when drafting the current IR parameters included in this proposal

The Slope2 parameter is to be revised to discourage utilisation exceeding the Uoptimal value Note several reserves are experiencing utilisation marginally exceeding Uoptimal 

As utilisation of each reserve decreases over time the Uoptimal will be periodically lowered to discourage new debt positions emerging Any proposed changes to the Uoptimal parameter will be presented via a separate ARFC 

Upon implementation this change will not trigger liquidation of any users funds and will gradually increase the cost for users who remain on v2 Please note there is a Migration Tool that was developed by BGD to aid users migrating from v2 to v3 

Assets in scope DAI MATIC wBTC wETH USDC and USDT

 Frozen Assets

Each frozen reserve contains a small portion of funds with a very minimal amount of debt For these assets we recommend a more aggressive implementation reduce the Uoptimal to 1000 revise Slope1 to 5000 and Slope2 to 50000  with  the exception of BAL which receives a Uoptimal of 20 due to current utilisation being around 15

Assets in scope BAL CRV DPI GHST LINK and SUSHI

 Specification

The following parameters are to be updated as follows

 Asset  Current Slope1  Proposed Slope1  Current Uoptimal  Proposed Uoptimal  Current Slope2  Proposed Slope2 
                        
 BAL    2700  5000  6500  2000  23600  50000

Subject to approval from ChaosLabs a subsequent proposal will be submitted every two weeks

 Next Steps

1 Gather feedback from the community

Title ARFC Orbit Program Renewal May 2024 
Date 20240513
Author Marc Zeller  Aave Chan Initiative ACI


 Summary

Proposing the renewal of the Orbit program for recognized delegates compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement of Gas costs associated with their governance activity

 Motivation

Orbit recognizes the added value of the Delegates in the decentralization  diversity of the Aave DAO This compensation allows them to focus on aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter

With the transition to Governance V3 a significant feature introduced is gasless voting via Gelato integration on the DAOrun governance apphttpsvoteonaavecom making it easier for delegates to participate without the burden of gas costs This innovation prompts the proposal to discontinue the general gas rebate program However recognizing the continued necessity for proposal creation and payload deployment activities we propose maintaining targeted gas rebates for these specific actions

Title ARFC Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum
Date 20240513
Author Aave Chan Initiative ACI


 Summary

The proposal aims to onboard Threshold Networks tBTC to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum tBTC is backed onetoone with Bitcoin

 MotivationBackground

tBTC is Thresholds decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereums Decentralized Finance DeFi applications Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet

Having recently acquired a Chainlink oracle tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC ie bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave

tBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO and extensively utilizes the Threshold Networks threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network on which many other decentralized applications are being built

Threshold Network DAO was born out of the first onchain merger between two decentralized protocols Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022 The DAO has successfully operated since that time and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability

 Benefits for Aave

 Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack
 A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC
 Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD into the Aave offering
 Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation boosting Aave protocol use fees and TVL
 Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitriums LTIPP

 Emission schedule

tBTC is onetoone backed with real Bitcoin meaning that there isnt an emissions schedule but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system

 Risks

For tBTC wallets are created periodically based on governance In order for the wallet to move funds it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm requiring 51of100 Signers to cooperate The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon More can be found here  Wallet Generation  Threshold Docshttpsdocsthresholdnetworkapplicationstbtcv2walletgeneration

The Threshold Council multisig is a 69 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts However those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC

Title ARFC Reduce Reserve Factor on wstETH 
Author ACI Aave Chan Initiative
Date 20240624



 Summary
For further alignment with the upcoming Lido Alliance proposals this proposal will reduce the reserve factor for wstETH to 5 

 Motivation

Aave and Lido have historically seen symbiotic growth with stETH being one of the premier collaterals on Aave and leveraged staking being one of the most profitable use cases for both Aave DAO and Lido users

As part of the recently passed TEMP CHECK proposalhttpsgovernanceaavecomttempcheckdeployalidoaavev3instance17930 to create an isolated instance for wstETH borrowers a number of other parameter changes were proposed to align Lido and Aave 

This proposal implements the agreed reserve factor change for wstETH to 5

 Specification

On all networks change wstETH Reserve Factor to 5

Title ARFC Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market 
Author ACI Aave Chan Initiative
Date 20240626



 Summary
This proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market 

 Motivation

Artemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly Therefore 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS

artMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETISMETIS pair on Hercules allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 05 slippage The pool TVL currently has 343M and is available herehttpsappherculesexchangepools0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E

artMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on Shoebillhttpsmetismetisshoebillfinance METIS market enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over 3 million TVL

 Benefits of listing artMETIS

We believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave

 Increased liquidity The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs
 Market expansion and user adoption The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform
 Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity This in turn generates more fee revenue for the project
 AAVEs artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of 500010000 in oMETIS Option Metis along with an extra 1X ART Points These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops

 Chain to be deployedlisted

artMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications

 Proof of Liquidity POL and Deposit Commitments

The Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX

Furthermore the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token Artemis as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis

Artemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop

In recognition of Artemiss efforts the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave

In summary the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity implementation of liquidity mining programs support for staking and yield farming opportunities and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem

Title ARFC Deploy whitelabel Aave V3 Market  Reental 
Author ACI Aave Chan Initiative
Date 20240626



 Summary
The current proposal aims to deploy a whitelabel version of Aave V3 for Reental tokens on the Polygon network By allowing friendly forks of Aave V3 Aave can increase its technology adoption and provide an alternative source of revenue and synergies for the DAO and thirdparty teams

 Specification

We are witnessing a highly favorable trend and narrative regarding RWAs and Aave can maintain its leadership by embracing the unstoppable growth of this ecosystem Reental can contribute to this growth with its collateralized lending market

Reental proposes launching a whitelisted Aave V3 instance bringing along the current 46 million tokenized volume which could be collateralized immediately and the potential for billions more in the coming years

20 of the generated fees will be allocated to the Aave DAO While the Reental market is not currently a significant business prospect for the Aave DAO and it is not expected to be a significant revenue driver the market has an interesting value proposition for offchain collateralbased liquidity protocols

This integration bridges the offchain world with the onchain realm through these RWAs which are already yielding returns for investors

Reental will assume the role of risk admin for this market adding new properties monthly

 Simple Summary

Proposal to onboard dlcBTC to Aave v3 on the Ethereum and Arbitrum pools

 MotivationBackground

dlcBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum enabling Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi protocols while retaining full ownership of their assets It leverages Discreet Log Contracts DLCs for secure crosschain transactions ensuring trustless and decentralized asset management dlcBTC is minted by a decentralized set of merchants who lock BTC with themselves a process we call selfwrapping ensuring selfcustody and reducing central points of failure

Unlike other bridges dlcBTC merchants selfwrap Bitcoin meaning funds are never sent to an external address reducing the risk of theft or loss dlcBTC has a Chainlink proof of reserve feed See httpsdatachainlinkfeedsarbitrummainnetdlcbtcporhttpsdatachainlinkfeedsarbitrummainnetdlcbtcpor

Benefits of listing that token

Listing dlcBTC will enable Bitcoin holders to use their assets as collateral within Aave increasing liquidity and user engagement on the platform It will attract a broader user base from the Bitcoin community and enhance the diversity of collateral options within Aave Additionally it supports DeFi platforms such as Nektar and Swaap which can generate staking yield using dlcBTC

Market Impact

Including dlcBTC will positively impact Aaves liquidity and user adoption leveraging Bitcoins status as the largest digital asset by market cap and its global brand recognition The secure and decentralized nature of dlcBTC will contribute to the platforms growth and stability enhancing security for users and expanding the overall market reach of Aave While wBTC has seen great success its reliance on a single custodian introduces significant counterparty risk dlcBTC addresses this by decentralizing the merchant set substantially reducing the potential for counterparty failures

 TEMP CHECK Onboard CDCETH to Aave V3 on Ethereum
 Author Jlok  ACI
  Date 20240715


 Summary

This proposal is to explore community interest in adding Cryptocomhttpcryptocom Staked ETH CDCETH to Aave V3 on the Ethereum mainnet CDCETH is an ERC20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the Cryptocomhttpcryptocom platform

 Motivation

Cryptocomhttpcryptocom was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet As of June 2024 Cryptocom httpcryptocom has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance security and privacy

Cryptocomhttpcryptocom launched its onchain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform 

To enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH Cryptocomhttpcryptocom introduced a Liquid Staking Token LST  Cryptocomhttpcryptocom Staked ETH CDCETH in November 2023 and reached 100M TVL Defillama page here

Currently CDCETHs onchain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETHETH pair on Curve here and Uniswap here with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues 

Other liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the Cryptocomhttpcryptocom Exchange platform with support from multiple market makers 

The liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the Cryptocomhttpcryptocom platform

Integrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the Cryptocomhttpcryptocom platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded

Confidential bannerslistings on the Cryptocomhttpcryptocom noncustodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the noncustodial wallet
Onboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and Cryptocomhttpcryptocom users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETHs utility as a LST resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH  Aave adoption  increased revenues for both parties

 Proof of Liquidity POL and Deposit Commitments

 Cryptocomhttpcryptocom is committed to providing initial supplyside liquidity of up to 5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of 100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start

Integration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with Cryptocomhttpcryptocoms noncustodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform

Set Borrow cap to 46 Million


Proposal remove the borrow cap on the cCOMP market

On last Wednesdays Community Call I tried and failed to record the callnext time we discussed removing the cCOMP borrow cap of 100k COMP The borrow cap was originally put into place to prohibit someone from using the market to borrow COMP create a governance proposal vote and return the capital in seconds After the upgrade to Governor Bravo and the installation of a review period the governance process is significantly more costprohibitive for a borrower to obtain the necessary votes to meet the proposal threshold As well the review period gives users 48hours to position their COMP holding for a vote unlike Governor Alpha which used an instantaneous voting system If a malicious user were to borrow the required COMP to meet the proposal threshold the community would have sufficient time to defeat their proposal

Removing the borrow cap will help the COMP market develop Trading firms onchain and offchain utilize money markets like Compound and Aave in their systems to borrow assets and particularly ones that are not abundant in supply in traditional borrowlend services like BlockFi Genesis Nexo and Celsius It is helpful for everyone if spot and futures markets are efficient

Next Steps Changing the borrow cap does not require a traditional governance proposal since caps are controlled by the community multisig The multisig holders follow the direction of the community Below is a 7day poll for removing the borrow cap on the cCOMP market If you vote YES you think the borrow cap should be removed If you vote NO you do not think the borrow cap should be removed If the poll revolves to YES after the 7day period the multisig holders will remove the borrow cap",10.025577170586383
409,"In December the compound community multisig received 1866k ETHW through a whitehat hack Weve been looking for methods to hand it over to the DAO since the receiving the ETHW however since there is limited DEX liquidity and bridging abilities this has been difficult Recently AlphaGrowth has agreed to facilitate the OTC transaction via wintermute

This proposal seeks guidance from the community on moving forwards with swapping and transferring the ETHW Given community support we will swap to either USDC or ETH and pay out a 10 whitehat bounty to Arr00 The remaining 90 of funds will be sent to the Compound DAO multisig

If the sum of the swap votes is higher than the do not swap votes we will follow the swap selection with the most votes",16.53155080697585
