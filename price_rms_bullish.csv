To date Uniswap has four deployments Ethereum Abritrum Optimism and Polygon In addition to these deployments there are proposals to deploy Uniswap on Harmony Celo and more chains expected soon The protocol should continue to deploy to new markets but as the protocol continues to grow it is vital the protocol learns to manage each of the deployments With each new chain there is new infrastructure that needs to be adapted to so that UNI on Ethereum can govern all of these deployments

GFX Labs has been researching the various deployments and has prepared the first Uniswap crosschain proposal to demonstrate how mainnet UNI can manage deployments on other chains

Polygon has a messaging mechanism between Ethereum and Polygon called the FxPortalhttpsdocspolygontechnologydocsdevelopl1l2communicationfxportal The portal functions via three contracts FxRoot State Sender  FxChild Messages can be sent from Ethereum to Polygon by calling the sendMessageToChildaddress bytes at the FxRoot contract on Ethereum which calls the State Sender contract The validatorshttpsdocspolygontechnologydocsvalidatepolygonbasicswhoisvalidator monitor the State Sender contract and relay messages to the FxChild on Polygon Upon successful relay to the FxChild the message is executed on Polygon by the validators

The owner of the Uniswap v3 contracts on Polygon is the Ethereum Proxy contracthttpspolygonscancomaddress0x8a1b966ac46f42275860f905dbc75efbfdc12374code The proxy contract will only process transactions that originate from the Timelock contracthttpsetherscanioaddress0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bccode on Ethereum and are delivered by the FxChildhttpspolygonscancomaddress0x8397259c983751daf40400790063935a11afa28a Every governance proposal targeting a change on Polygon should set the FxRoothttpsetherscanioaddress0xfe5e5d361b2ad62c541bab87c45a0b9b018389a2code on Ethereum as the target and send the message parameter change via the contract The message passed through the FxRoot must contain the targets contract on Polygon the functions to call the call datas similar to the proposal system

For the pilot of crosschain governance we are implementing the 1 basis point1 tick fee tier on Polygon The 1bp pools on Ethereum have been incredibly successful and increased Uniswaps market share significantly since GFX Labs successful proposal in November 2021

Related Discussion Our proposal is similar to Voltz Additional Use Granthttpsgovuniswaporgtshoulduniswapprovidevoltzwithv3additionalusegrant15669

 What is Rage Trade

Rage Tradehttpsragetrade is a new perpetual swap  protocol built using Uniswap v3 Many onchain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs However traders and LPs benefit from v3s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp

 Why do we need an additional use grant

Our proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3s code but instead we have built on top of it Think of Uniswap as our matching engine and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswaps core leverage trading leverage LPing crossmargin liquidations and real time funding rates 

 What changes have we made that require additional use

We have built libraries to enable leverage trading leverage LPing and realtime funding rates Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswaps BUSL protect code that we require an additional grants use for

 SimulateSwaphttpsgithubcomRageTradecoreblobea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230contractslibrariesSimulateSwapsol This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage It makes use of Uniswaps TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries
 TickBitmapExtendedhttpsgithubcomRageTradecoreblobea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230contractslibrariesTickBitmapExtendedsol This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswaps TickBitmap required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract
 TickExtendedhttpsgithubcomRageTradecoreblobea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230contractslibrariesTickExtendedsol This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3
 LiquidityPositionhttpsgithubcomRageTradecoreblobea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230contractslibrariesLiquidityPositionsolL5 This library enables leverage liquidity providing and the accompanying margin logic It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so


  How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap

1 Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3 Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 not a fork all additional TVL  trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3

2 Rage Trade will spend significant RD resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 8020 strategy that composes with Curves tricrypto

3 Liquid  composable onchain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies Using perps Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging Additionally multicollateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market 

 Conclusion

Rage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswaps value as a protocol We look forward to discussing our proposal with the Uniswap community and answering questions in the comments below",32.40418118466898
7,"Summary

Despite being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols Uniswaps outstanding voting power does not necessarily translate into active governance participation In fact many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50 vote participation rate and some even as low as 10 or 0 While there have been previous campaigns httpsxcomUniswapFNDstatus1653077861706739714s20 to encourage delegation by large UNI holders we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated if at all

In healthy governance environments proactive delegates wield significant voting power ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met

Therefore this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate 25 million UNI to each of 4 active yet underrepresented delegates selected based on the criteria outlined below To ensure further accountability each delegate must maintain a 80 participation rate at a minimum as explained further in Participation Requirements or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below In addition there will 1 year term so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned And if a received delegate is removed without fulling this 1 year term the role wont be filled

Despite numerous improvements to Uniswaps governance there are still several areas that require further improvement One prominent area is governance participation which has witnessed a downward trend compared to late 2022 and early 2023

Another issue is many large delegates are now inactive and the delegators who entrusted them with delegation are either unaware about this inactivity or simply do not care For example there is currently several delegates with more than 25 million UNI delegated who never even voted onchain according to Tally see the screenshot below

Therefore further distributing governance power to active but underrepresented delegates is a positive step forward ensuring governance is more active resilient and robust

Participation Requirements

 Must have voted on 80 or more of proposals minus the proposals that were canceled over the last 3 months as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot This includes both Snapshot and Onchain proposals such as Tally or Agora
 Must have actively participated in proposal voting for more than 3 months and have a Delegate Platform on Uniswap Forum under Delegation Pitch

Application Criteria

 Meets the above Participation Requirements
 Voting Power is less than 25 million UNI as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot

Next Steps

 Should this proposal pass on Snapshot a 5day period will begin where delegates that meet the above criterias are encouraged to post their application to be considered for delegation In cases where there are more than Four qualified applicants there will be an additional Snapshot vote to determine the top Four Once Four or fewer applicants are selected in case there are not enough delegates that meet the criteria it will proceed to an onchain vote

Other Clarification

The term will be 1 year from when 25 M UNI is delegated

Should the onchain vote be approved but there are three or fewer qualified applicants because there are not enough qualified applicants there WONT be a subsequent application period and Snapshot vote after the initial vote to fill the remaining available recipients

Should the onchain vote be approved and there are qualified applicants but one or more of them are disqualified in the future due to their low vote participation there will NOT be a new application and snapshot vote to give the opportunity to another delegate

As mentioned by in a previous proposal httpsgovuniswaporgtrfconboardingekuboincasacoredeveloperofuniswapprotocol2208520 seeking UNI delegation there will be deployment of at max four new Franchiser httpsgithubcomNoahZinsmeisterfranchiserblobmainspecmd contracts each one funded with 25M UNI 10M UNI total The owner of these Franchiser instances would be the Timelock while the at max four delegates chosen through the voting process outlined above can act as the delegatees",25.276073619631905
8,"This proposal is a continuation of the topic from VIP51 Previously several VRT Swap  XVS Vesting architecture designs were proposed that differed from the original design summarized in the Venus Tokenomics 2 published in August of 2021 One of these alternative designs referred to as fixed speed vesting proposed a vesting schedule that would have allowed all XVS to vest very quickly if VRT was separated into a multitude of accounts and deposited separately This potential workaround required a countermeasure in the form of a global daily limit on all deposits Many in the community pointed out concerns regarding this daily limit from a technical and user experience perspective

We considered feedback regarding the daily limit and how this unfairly allows those with bots to consume the daily quota before everyone else each day There is no technically feasible way to prevent this issue with the fixed speed model so we are proposing deployment of the original swap  vesting design

12,"Summary

It has been approximately one year since the last revision to Venus Tokenomics and given the continuing evolution of the market its time to reevaluate an optimal distribution of income given the protocols current and future needs

This proposal seeks to address the unequal distribution of income between rewards and treasury reserves It lays out a comprehensive plan to optimize the income distribution in order to better cater to the protocols needs and safeguard its sustainability

The key highlights of the proposed changes are as follows

Redistribute protocol reserve revenue allocation to
40 Risk Fund
40 Treasury Reserve
10 XVS Vault Rewards Buyback
10 Venus Prime Token Program

Redistribute liquidation and other product development distribution to
50 Risk Fund
40 Treasury Reserves
10 XVS Vault Rewards Buyback

Make use of the savings from the two rounds of 50 XVS emissions reduction to double the XVS vault legacy rewards currently set at 525 XVSDay to 1050 XVSDay with the aim of maintaining or even enhancing the vault rewards

Adjust the Venus Prime program Soulbound Token rewards Initial rewards for this program have been 20 of accumulated product revenues since Q4 2022 These rewards currently exceed 750K which are expected to significantly increase the APYs for eligible participants 

We propose to reduce the programs revenue allocation to 10 to balance rewards while preserving attractive APYs and incentivizing user participation

The expected outcomes are an increase in treasury reserves sustainable reward emission rates sustainable Venus Prime SBT reward incentives and maintenance of an attractive APR to reward XVS Vault stakers

Methodology of Analysis

To bring forth these recommendations the proposal has assessed the existing tokenomics of the Venus Protocol considered the past changes and their impact on the ecosystem and analyzed the market dynamics and trends

This change is possible if we consider the savings from the protocols October and February 50 XVS emission reduction which accounted for an estimated amount of more than 27M With this we propose reallocating these savings towards XVS vault stakers enhancing rewards without compromising on the token emission rate

Results and Conclusions

The proposed revisions in Venus Protocol Tokenomics are expected to yield positive results for the Venus ecosystem ensuring a fairer distribution of income and enhancing the platforms sustainability

15,"Summary 

The proposal to list weETH assets on Venus Protocol offers significant benefits to the Venus community including the opportunity to add Liquid Restaking Tokens LRT from etherfi on ETH Mainnet 

Users can stake their ETH earn rewards and enjoy additional benefits through restaking on EigenLayer With approximately 27B in TVL already deposited into the etherfi protocol the addition of weETH to Venus can enhance asset diversity and liquidity on the platform

By integrating weETH Venus allows users to earn etherfi
and EigenLayer points for future incentives along with lending APY on their holdings 

The proposed liquidity mining incentive offered by Etherfi for weETH suppliers demonstrates a commitment to jumpstart the market on Venus and attract more users This move positions Venus as a pioneer in capturing the restaking market catering to the growing demand for LRTs and providing users with a wider range of opportunities 

Overall listing weETH on Venus Protocol aligns with the communitys focus on decentralization sustainability and doing what is right for the Ethereum ecosystem The proposal not only enhances asset diversity and liquidity but also strengthens the collaboration between Venus and etherfi to drive innovation and value creation for users",25.754231052244297

To produce 12 independent animations with a run time of 1 minute each

This proposal introduces an ecosystemwide casting call to all eligible IP Holders powered by ApeCoin The animators of Atrium have experience with Disney Pixar HBO Netflix  more and await the opportunity to cocreate with community members Funding this proposal showcases ApeCoins dedication to providing new avenues for creators and results in 12 animations under a Legend of ApeCoin theme

Rationale of Value Added to ApeCoin

 In an increasingly digital landscape content rules permanence and brand recall Good brands build timeless content that fans can anchor on That in turn creates an increasingly valuable ecosystem around it As the canon storylines are created officially by Yuga this proposal to the ApeCoin DAO community has a unique opportunity to cocreate equally memorable characters and storylines that are completely driven bottomsup
 Being crypto native and having highly experienced talent from the animation industry Pixar Sony Netflix Dreamworks Marvel Atrium is uniquely positioned to work with ApeCoin DAO to create content that appeals to mainstream audience bring more awareness to an already lovable cryptonative brand and deliver cocreated cinematic content

How does this benefit DAO  DAO members

 ApeCoin DAO produces the storylines the community creates involving the ApeCoin brand
 Cocreate with crypto native network of qualified animators and filmmakers
 Reinforces top of mind for communityproduced content on all social channels Atriums previously created content has recorded millions of impressions and hundreds of thousands of views in aggregate
 Crypto native distribution mechanism of artifacts used in the production content viewing companion mints all made available free to the community members

Based on the overall reception of the pilot shortfilm series if community wants to expand on any specific storyline  Atrium will have logistics In place to build out the series with followup proposal

What is Atrium

Atrium is a blockchainbacked network of artists and creators Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting Animation Concept Art Voice Actors and Music production

Securing topquality creative talent who are well versed in the NFT space and committed to supporting the longterm growth of an ecosystem is extraordinarily difficult Here at Atrium we have curated and nurtured a collective of outstanding animators illustrators storytellers and allaround remarkable creativesTake a look at a few of our creators below

Eight months ago Wise token successfully launched on Ethereum and currently boasts a 300 million Total Value Locked TVL and about 10000 users Now on BSC with a BEP20 version of Wise WISB tokens have the same innovative features as the original token on Ethereum as well as some important upgrades

Reduced Impermanent Loss  WISBBNB liquidity pairs have significantly reduced impermanent loss because the prices of WISB and BNB are correlated you can already see this concept in action on WISEETH LP on Uniswap and Quickswap This makes WISB the premier LP token to have on BSC

BNB Airdrops  Wallets staking WISB for 365 days or longer will receive weekly ongoing airdrops in BNB The revenue for this is generated from lending out the massive liquidity formed in the presale Currently the weekly airdrop pool is 30000 in BNB

In addition to regular staking and LP farming on Pancakeswap this proposal and other partner DEXs WISB tokens can be lent to the Reserve Pool which is a profits sharing pool where holders can earn a slice of the entire ecosystems profits This becomes especially interesting considering the profits generated by the system are bound to skyrocket once the LendingBorrowing contract is deployed later this year

WISB token is the ethical standard for all DeFi projects It is a fairly launched fairly distributed fully decentralized audited cryptobacked and highly liquid asset

Fairly launched  No parties received free tokens or discounted tokens not even the founderteam

Fairly distributed  Everyone paid fair market price to obtain WISB

Fully Decentralized  100 automated by smart contracts with no admin keys

Audited  By CoinFabrik  httpswisetokennetWise_Audit_ReportpdfhttpswisetokennetWise_Audit_Reportpdf  The WISE team also ran a 100 ETH bug bounty for the community to double check the code before launching

BNBbacked  100 value of the BNB raised in the presale goes straight into the Pancakeswap pair which is then locked forever by burning the LP tokens

Highly liquid  Massive liquidity allows investors to buy more without moving the price against themselves All successful markets need massive liquidity in order to reach a large market cap and this is part of the long term WISB strategy

WISB is one of the safest assets you can hold in the entire BSC ecosystem and also the only system that shares 100 of profits with its holders Wise token was designed to be the most efficient DeFi ecosystem ever made and we believe that focusing all profits back to users gives us a massive competitive advantage versus the traditional corporatestyle business models Wise token was created by the community and for the community and we invite you to become part of our amazing group

 An Explainer What are the 2 different sale sessions

 Private Sale 400000 20 of Sale allocation

For the Private Sale participants are required to own a Pancake Squad NFThttpspancakeswapfinancepancakesquad and set them as your Pancake Profile avatarhttpsdocspancakeswapfinanceproductsnftprofilesystemprofileguide

65,"Main purpose of this proposal is to allow users to unlock the CAKE in emergency reduce the CAKE circulating and reduce the MAX CAKE supply in long term 

This will give users more confidence as they can unstake CAKE with penalty and they wont miss out opportunity to cash out if CAKE price increases

We should allow users to unlock CAKE before unlock date at penalty of 20 and 20 of penalty will be directly sent for burning and the amount is reduced from 750M max supply This will slowly reduce the max supply and circulating supply and allow users to unlock their CAKE in emergency

This will bring more users to staking and reduce the CAKE supply in long term



Example  

If I have 1000 cake in locked staking I can unlock CAKE any time and I will get 800 CAKE back and 200 CAKE will be sent to burn address and MAX CAKE supply will be reduced to

Either set a date where anyone who wants to can withdraw are locked staking as you have changed the APR and rules so that should allow us to uninvest if we no longer aline together or burn a SUBSTANTIAL Amount of total supply tokens to substitute for the losses we have occured

As we continue to optimize CAKE rewards across all of our deployments we are able to gradually lower the overall CAKE emission while maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate a smooth trading experience Ultimately this enables us to contribute a greater amount of CAKE towards the weekly burn 

The previous round of Adjustments to Farm Rewardshttpspancakeswapfinancevotingproposal0x3e68425e233875d0ed4d553e0da44bfe927f75d56714545c7a7c7ea4a9b4a35c increased the overall CAKE burn by approximately 4000 CAKE per day with minimal impact to trading volumes

Given the traction and overall market share shown on our BNB Chain v3 deployments this proposal aims to decrease emissions to the farms listed below and increase the overall CAKE burn by approximately 1700 CAKE per day

These optimizations will add up over the coming months to 1 improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across farms and 2 redirect CAKE rewards towards the highest growth farms ultimately accelerating the path towards ultrasound CAKE

 Adjustment Details

With the above in mind we are proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below Note all other BNB Chain v3 farms will continue to earn the same level of rewards and even with these adjustments the farms below will continue to have a healthy level of liquidity volume and APR

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their average daily volume 14day volume capital efficiency and alternatives available

Dear CAKE holders were excited to announce a new Syrup Pool with APX Finance the partner for PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2

APX Finance is a decentralized derivatives exchange that designed the Permissionless DEX Engine which powers PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on BNB Chain and Arbitrum

For an update on how the product has performed thus far please refer to the section Performance of Perpetuals v2 on Arbitrum below

 The Syrup Pool on opBNB

Stake ALP tokens to earn CAKE tokens


Syrup Pool on opBNB
   Total Tokens 11250 CAKE  427500 APX converted into CAKE
  Distribution duration 45 days
  Start time Approx 1000 UTC on 20 Dec 2023
  Finish time Approx 1000 UTC on 4 Feb 2024
  Token rewards per second  CAKE will depend on final CAKE amount


The CAKE tokens used to fund these Syrup Pools will be provided by PancakeSwap and APX Finance equally The final CAKE amount will depend on token prices at time of conversion

On PancakeSwaps side the CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions but rather will be taken from our Multichain Warchest allocation The yield from the Syrup Pool will encourage more users to participate in PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on opBNB increasing liquidity which will ultimately lead to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees

 Max Stake per Wallet

There will be no cap on how much CAKE a user can stake in the Syrup Pool This is to encourage as much onchain ALP liquidity as possible

 Performance of Perpetuals v2 on Arbitrum

Since the launch on 28 Aug 2023 PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on Arbitrum has achieved impressive results surpassing 1 billion in cumulative trading volume and attracting over 1000 users With the support of liquidity attracted through syrup pools our platform has consistently secured a prominent position among the leading derivatives protocols on Arbitrum in volume

Our previous Syrup Pool proposal successfully incentivized liquidity provision which is crucial for facilitating trading on the perpetuals platform We have currently attained more than 2 million in liquidity value of minted ALP tokens of which 15 million are staked in our Syrup Pool

During the period of incentivisation how much CAKE was spent on the ALP pool How much CAKE was burnt instead This will allow your community to understand the valueformoney

Our goal is to establish a dominant position in the derivatives category on opBNB This proposal seeks to kickstart liquidity provision in the ALP Pool to facilitate trading for the perpetuals platform on opBNB

 What is Perpetuals Trading

Disclaimer This information presented in this proposal does not constitute any form of financial advice or recommendation please do your own research before making any investment decisions

Perpetuals perpetual swaps or perps are a special type of futures contract without an expiration date

Futures trading allows users to enter positions on margin leverage using borrowed funds to optimize capital Using leverage allows a user to enter a position with a size that is larger than their account balance For example using 10x leverage a user could trade 100 CAKE for the price of 10 CAKE In this example the initial margin would be 10 CAKE which is used to collateralize the leveraged position

In PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 weve streamlined our interface by removing the order book and market depth displays Instead our partner APX Finance has introduced the ALP pool which now provides liquidity for all trading pairs maximizing your capital usage The ALP pool will actively participate in the marketmaking process for our V2 perpetual contracts

 What is ALP

From the team ALP is APX Finances liquidity provider token made up of a pool of assets USDC USDT DAI ETH BTC Users can become liquidity providers by using any of the specified assets to buy ALP ALP pool is the direct counterparty of V2 onchain perp traders

The initial issue price of ALP is USD1 The price of ALP is influenced by the profit or loss of the pool and income from trading fees funding fees and liquidations

In the future APX Finance plans to support more utility of ALP on the platform such as earning transaction fee rewards using ALP as margin for perpetuals trading and participation in DAO governance and voting

 Proposal to Launch veCAKE Gauges System on zkSync

As mentioned in our initial veCAKE proposalhttpspancakeswapfinancevotingproposal0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c we are launching veCAKE in phases and are excited to share the next deployment  zkSync

 Recap VoteEscrowed CAKE Overview

As a quick summary heres quick recap of veCAKE with the following utilities

1 Direct Gauge Emissions  veCAKE holders will be able to directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power which will be determined by veCAKE balance

2 Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation  external protocols such as veCAKE managers and bribe markets will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE rewards and receive voting incentives for doing so veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to automate their voting and potentially earn boosted rewards However direct participation is highly encouraged
 
 Inclusion of zkSync in veCAKE Gauges System

Currently the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain Ethereum and Arbitrum is 099 CAKEblock  

With the inclusion of zkSync the current Trading Allocation emission of 00131 CAKE per block directed towards zkSync Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions 

As part of the voting gauges design the Kitchen proposes to retain a 40 voting share of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs such as ETHUSDC on zkSync 



There are two key reasons
 To ensure a smooth transition for liquidity providers from farms managed by the Kitchen to farms which are managed by veCAKE voting without affecting their APRs significantly in the initial rollout
 To ensure that core liquidity pools continue to receive sufficient incentives so that liquidity depth and fee generation are not significantly affected This will ensure the continuity of CAKE burns from trading fees which drives deflationary CAKE tokenomics

In the initial rollout phase the Kitchen will distribute these votes based on the following principles
 Ensuring core liquidity pools are provided a competitive return on their LP positions
 Ensuring that existing Syrup Pool partner arrangements are met before migrating them fully to the veCAKE gauge voting system
 Ensuring that any of the smaller farms which did not receive any votes after the launch of veCAKE will receive at least some allocation in the initial rollout capped at their current emission levels

With the proposed vote allocation the Kitchen will distribute its share of votes at the end of each voting epoch after all voting participants have voted 

In other words the Kitchen will apply its voting share at maximum translating to 04 CAKEblock as far as needed to smoothen out any possible abrupt changes in the Farms while allowing veCAKE participants to get used to the gauge voting mechanism 

If the gauge voting results will not affect any core liquidity pools and trading volumes significantly the Kitchen will abstain from voting in that particular voting epoch or vote in alignment with existing votes

Over time the Kitchen aims to reduce the portion of CAKE emissions directly managed by the Kitchen as all veCAKE participants become familiar with the process

 Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE launched shortly on zkSync after this vote concludes",52.47883917775091
98,"This proposal has two principles to empower Ultrasound CAKE


1 Increase the MAX CAPS proposed weight gauges for the CAKE pool from 35 to 60


Pros  This will undoubtedly encourage more CAKE staking consequently strengthening the entire community and reducing selling pressure


2 Develop a new aggressive reduction plan around 50 of emissions to take place over the next 4 months


Pros  It is crucial to signal greater scarcity of CAKE to the market All holders stand to gain from this measure And this could happen until the BTC halving to take advantage of the bull run  THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TIMING


Cons  This two proposals may decrease CAKE reward in farms However perform an analysis There are two types of suppliers


1 The holder
2 Those who sell CAKE to increase their APR farm


The holder will not be bothered by these measures as they will benefit from them However those who sell CAKE will have two alternatives Either they will start to become holders which is beneficial for the community or they will lose some selling CAKE rewards But okay they can continue selling as the selling pressure will decrease significantly and soon they will realize that selling CAKE is a bad deal


I have been with CAKE since day 1 I saw CAKE go from 029 to 13 then 22 and reaching 44 


Today the protocol built by the devs who deserve ENORMOUS RESPECT AND CONGRATULATIONS FROM THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY for their work is much better than when it reached above 40 So we need to instill more confidence to holde CAKE and to reduce the constant every day selling from farms by those who are only interested in increasing APR Even these individuals should benefit because with a higher CAKE price the suppliers CAKE reward will be greater

103,"Summary

A proposal by the MechanismCapital 13 team to create a Curve Metapool for Empty Set Dollar ESD and the 3Pool stablecoins USDC USDT and DAI

ESD has been one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins launched to date Its market capitalization has grown to over 65 million in the 2 months since its inception peaked near 100 million

The unique mechanism design of the protocol makes it a strong candidate to become one of the largest stable collateral assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem

Creating an ESD metapool would attract more liquidity to the Curve platform and lead to increased trading fees

Learn more about metapools here httpsresourcescurvefifaqbaseandmetapools 1

Abstract

Empty Set Dollar ESD is a new algorithmic seignioragebased stablecoin that utilizes fixed protocol rules on supply expansion as well as a unique coupon creation  redemption model to incentivize trustless coordination between selfish participants that maintain ESDs synthetic peg 11 with the US dollar all onchain Unlike other algorithmic stable coins like AMPL ESD does not rebase all balances using nonstandard functions but instead adjusts supply through other mechanisms allowing ESD to have the same composability as other standard ERC20 tokens

Currently crypto lacks a truly decentralized and censorshipresistant stablecoin While DAI and sUSD come close they currently have vulnerabilities in their architecture The goal of ESD is to create a truly permissionless scaleable stable store of value that can be used as superfluid collateral in DeFi

Note ESD currently only incentivizes the ESDUSDC Uniswap pool In order to motivate more liquidity to flow to this Curve metapool ESD holders would have to vote to upgrade ESD to incentivize this new pool However various ESD community members have already expressed their support for such a prospective proposal to reward Curve LPs

Liquidity

Total Uniswap Liquidity as of 1132020 152 million

Avg Daily Trading Volume Last 14 Days ended 1132020 375 million

Token Holder Distribution

As of 1142020 there are currently over 853 unique addresses holding ESD This includes 668 staked addresses

Over 90 of ESD tokens were staked to the DAO as of 1132020

Motivation

This is an opportunity for Curve to attract more liquidity to its platform and increase trading fees It would also benefit the ESD community by increasing the efficiency of ESD turnover and accelerating ESD contraction  expansion cycles to further stabilize the price of the token around 1 Finally accelerating the growth of ESD would enhance the antifragility of the entire DeFi ecosystem due to ESDs unique characteristics relative to other stable assets

Specification

This metapool would include ESD USDC USDT and DAI It is likely that the ESD protocol community would vote to incentivize this Curve metapool It already does this for the ESDUSDC pool on Uniswap httpsemptysetfinancepool

For

This pool would bring more liquidity and fees to the Curve protocol

It would also help accelerate and dampen the volatility ESDs expansioncontraction cycles which are currently delayed due to the limitations of slippage on the ESDUSDC Uniswap pool

Successful passage of this proposal would show the Curve communitys willingness to support new innovative protocols  specifically those focused on open and permissionless access to DeFi

Against

ESD is a relatively new and experimental protocol There are both known and unknown risks to explore as the protocol matures These include but are not limited to

ESD is expected to trade within a narrow band around US100 but has experienced short periods of significant volatility

A downward spiral in the instance of zero demand for new coupons though in the current contraction period over 26m coupons have been purchased

Smart contract bugs code is currently under audit and

A design flaw that leads to an economic attack see the recent Harvest Finance attack 1

 TLDR

Proposal to have 45k BAL 31 of the weekly distribution allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity between BAL and uncapped tokens WETH DAI USDC WBTC Wallets flagged as Balancer Labs shareholders dont qualify for this liquidity staking extra incentive
The main goals are to significantly increase liquidity on key BAL pairs and to allow nonshareholders to compound their BAL holdings at a much faster pace accelerating protocol decentralization

image621x500 50upload5S3GvpjON1hNGnO7wuSfqNd3smkpng   


 Motivation

The importance of BAL liquidity cant be overstated

 TRUER PRICE DISCOVERY it improves trading conditions for all market participants lower spreads and less slippage for both buyers and sellers allowing for a more transparent and effective price discovery process

 SUPERIOR LP INCENTIVES a stronger token with higher price inertia results in a higher quality for the incentives given to LPs liquidity providers via liquidity mining

 SHARPER GOVERNANCE it opens doors to a new class of invaluable stakeholders and protocol governors eg larger investors especially those heavily involved in and experienced with DeFi protocols

 BROADER GOVERNANCE with no participation from Balancer Labs shareholders more on that later liquidity staking will accelerate BAL distribution and protocol decentralization by giving all other BAL holders the opportunity to compound their governance rights at a much faster pace

 SAFER GOVERNANCE pools are noncustodial and BAL in them retain full voting power ie no need to withdraw liquidity to vote such that high liquidity and a healthy governance are not in conflict

Balancer itself being a DEX it feels only natural as the ideal venue for high BAL liquidity to be incentivized Finally its worth noting that allowing a high portion of the token supply to be concentrated on centralized exchanges could expose the governance to significant risks as illustrated by the episode with STEEM


 Recapping how liquidity adjustment currently works

The 145k BAL weekly distributionhttpsdocsbalancerfinanceprotocolballiquiditymining to LPs on Balancer is calculated proportionally to the adjusted liquidity contributed by each LP This adjustment is made by applying ie multiplying a few factors to their liquidity measured in dollar terms

Naturally the value of those factors can be
 equal to 1 having no effect
 less than 1 acting as a penalty when the liquidity is deemed less useful
 greater than 1 acting as an extra incentive

A feeFactor  1 see proposalhttpsforumbalancerfinancetmodifyingfeefactortowardreducingtheminingpenaltyforhighfeepools103 applies a small penalty to pools with higher fees

For each pair inside a pool we apply
  a wrapFactor of
    10 for uncorrelated pairs no penalty
    02 for soft pegshttpsforumbalancerfinancetmodifyingwrapfactorapplyinga02factortosoftpeggedpairs138
    01 for hard pegshttpsforumbalancerfinancetwrapfactorpenalizingpairsofequivalenttokensinliquiditymining28 and 

 a BRF BAL  Ratio Factor which is the combination of a ratioFactor  1 see proposalhttpsforumbalancerfinancetintroductionofaweightratiofactorinliquiditymining15 and a stakingBoost  1 described in this proposalhttpsforumbalancerfinancetbalfactorincentivizingballiquidityonbalancer102 and with further calculation details specified in its ammendmenthttpsforumbalancerfinancetbalfactorincentivizingballiquidityonbalancer1024 
BRF  stakingBoost  ratioFactor
   If the pair is not of type BAL  uncapped_token uncapped tokens currently being WETH DAI USDC WBTC BAL then its stakingBoost  1 ie the incentive doesnt apply to this pair

The current BRF will only depend on the characteristics of the pool its tokens and weights and may have a maximum value of 154 It looks like this

image690x455 75uploadxqztRzplangZYzS0j70jlwfgc7Ppng 

After looping through all possible pairs in a pool we combine their factors via weighted averagehttpsgithubcombalancerlabsbalminingscriptsblobmasterlibfactorsjsL111 and the result is a wrapFactor and a BRF for the whole pool 

Finally we calculate and apply a tokenCapFactor adjusting down the liquidity of a token when it exceeds a predetermined maximum Except for the 5 uncapped tokens already mentioned all tokens eligible for liquidity mining are currently capped at 10M each See more details on how to calculate ithttpsforumbalancerfinancetcapfactorcappingeligibleliquidityto10mpertoken56 and the recent changeshttpsforumbalancerfinancetproposaltoupdatethewhitelistprocess217 to how token caps will evolve

 The Proposal

This is a proposal to have 45k BAL 31 of the weekly distribution allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity staking

This extra incentive is

 all BAL distributed as a result of applying a stakingBoost  1 to the liquidity of BAL  uncapped_token pairs from wallets which are not flagged as shareholders of Balancer Labs

The remaining 100k BAL would be distributed to all LPs in all eligible pools disconsidering the effect of a stakingBoost ie all liquidity being subject to BRF  ratioFactor

The constant value now would be STAKERS_SHARE  45000  145000 and we can then calculate the unique value for stakingBoost that satisfies this target distribution 

The intended result is for BAL liquidity on Balancer to increase substantially but in a selfregulated way 

The simple yet powerful idea is as BAL liquidity gets higher the extra incentive to staking gets diluted among stakers so that our constant target for STAKERS_SHARE is met

In a more visual approach
 
 when nonshareholder BAL liquidity is low the stakingBoost will be high resulting in a high BRF a hypothetical scenario being the orange curve in the graph below in which BRF peaks at 12 so there will be a very strong incentive for BAL liquidity to increase

 when nonshareholer BAL liquidity is high the desired scenario the stakingBoost will have come down to lower levels resulting in a lower BRF a hypothetical scenario being the green curve below in which BRF peaks at 3

image621x500uploadoI5XnPgsZE1VcQWDyeJCWovr1IVpng  

 Calculating the stakingBoost a practical example

We first calculate the liquidityPreStaking the total adjusted liquidity from applying all factors but with stakingBoost  1 ie BRF  ratioFactor Lets say the result was 200M

We will need to apply a yet unknown stakingBoost so that
STAKERS_SHARE  finalLiquidity  liquidityPreStaking  finalLiquidity

 which can also be stated as
finalLiquidity  liquidityPreStaking  1  STAKERS_SHARE

In our example
finalLiquidity  200M  1  45000145000  290M

We may apply any temporary tempStakingBoost  1 to BAL  uncapped_token pairs from nonshareholder LPs resulting in a tempLiquidity Lets say our result was 230M This would mean the tempStakingBoost increased the adjusted liquidity in 30M while what we actually want is an increase of 90M

Now to get the desired stakingBoost we only need to stretch or shrink the tempStakingBoost according to the ratio between the two liquidity adjustments desired  temporary


finalLiquidity  liquidityPreStaking  tempLiquidity  liquidityPreStaking  stakingBoost  tempStakingBoost

 which in our example would result in

290  200  230  200  stakingBoost  tempStakingBoost
stakingBoost  3  tempStakingBoost


 Shareholder Addresses

An important aspect of this proposal is that Balancer Labs shareholders investors advisors and founders seem aligned with the spirit of the proposal to accelerate governance rights distribution In order to achieve this goal their wallets will be excluded from participating in liquidity staking This restriction doesnt apply to eventual BAL they hold that are unrelated to their shareholder allocations for instance BAL bought on the market or earned through being LPs with tokens other than their BAL shareholder allocation

Here is the complete list of shareholder addresses to be excluded from liquidity stakinghttpsgithubcombalancerlabsbalminingscriptsblobliquiditystakingsrcusersts

Note wallets currently tagged as Balancer Shareholder XX on Etherscan are actually vesting smart contracts which hold mostly locked ie yet unvested BAL Vesting happens continuously and linearly over a period of 3 years which started at token launch 20200620 When finally vested ie free to transfer BAL can only be withdrawn to the respective beneficiary address of each vesting contract The addresses listed above are the 51 unique beneficiaries of the 51 vesting contracts All the BAL balance they already hold is vested

The community is willing to tolerate up to about 10k BAL per week per shareholder being sent to centralized exchanges as they are cognizant of shareholders also seeking to deleverage their BAL positions over time without attempting to subvert the exclusion list In case some large BAL balances move to thirdparty custody solutions held in segregated addresses or to multisig wallets both situations are likely to happen the current list may be updated to reflect those new shareholder addresses as also excluded from liquidity staking

The community will have the prerogative to update this list so that changes are effective already before any still pending weekly distribution",37.78397565922921

TLDR

As outlined in the new whitelisting processhttpsforumbalancerfinancetproposaltoupdatethewhitelistprocess217 this is a proposal to increase the MKR capFactor from cap3 to cap4 10M  30M MKR has exceeded 10m adjusted liquidity for a period of time MKR bring good liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem



The Proposal

This is a proposal to increase the MKR cap Tier from cap3 to cap4 10M  30M MKR currently has 16M in adjusted liquidity and has probably surpassed its 10M cap for a month

MKR brings useful liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem Before Uniswap used to be the most popular DEX for trading MKR



What is MKR

MKR is a DeFi large cap it currently has a 600M market cap Theres currently 15B locked in MakerDAO and 425M DAI has been minted

SCD Single Collateral DAI was launched in December 2017 MCD Multi Collateral DAI was launched in November 2019

MakerDAO is a decentralized credit platform on Ethereum that supports DAI a stablecoin whose value is pegged to USD Anyone can use Maker to open a Vault lock in collateral such as ETH BAT or WBTC  and generate Dai as debt against that collateral Dai debt incurs a stability fee ie continuously accruing interest which is paid upon repayment of borrowed Dai DAI is collected as system surplus and then used in FLAP auctions to burn MKR

MKR can also be used as a governance token to govern the system MKR holders also act as the last line of defense in case of a black swan event If systemwide collateral value falls too low too fast MKR is minted and sold on the open market to raise more collateral diluting MKR holders

RPL appears to be a coin with a purpose and a real use case
The 26465785 70 RPL  30 WETH pool is one of the biggest on Balancer and earns BAL at a rate of 10m worth of BALyear

Unfortunately it generates very little volume with 24h volumes oscilating in low tens of thousands of USD last 24h volume 30891

A 2m pool would be enough to facilitate low slippage trading for such volumes so I propose reducing the BAL rewards cap to reduce from 10m to 3m I think that the 10m yearly worth of rewards could be used to encourage other more useful liquidity

On top of the low trading volumes and low interest from traders my subjective opinion is that the valuation is artificially inflated Im not happy about heavy concentration of this pool in hands of a single liquidity provider 90 single LP recently 97 CMC shows that this coin trades 900k on Bilaxy and 300k on LBank within 24h which I find hard to believe httpscoinmarketcapcomcurrenciesrocketpoolmarkets",39.08169533169532

 Summary

Introduce govFactor an onchain voting factor of 11 for Balancer Liquidity Providers

If passed the govFactor will initially be implemented as a 3 month trial with voter participation acting as the key success metric 

 Background

_  FireEyesDAOhttpsmediumcomfireeyesdao has been actively working with the Balancer team over the past few months in an effort to develop a robust suite of governance mechanisms to complement the upcoming launch of Balancer V2

One of the issues we concluded on consistent voter participation has historically been an issue for many DeFi protocols Whether it results in proposals not reaching quorum or only having a small number of participants involved its become obvious that protocols need to drive meaningful voter participation across a diverse group of users

The govFactor creates a simple incentive mechanism for liquidity providers LPs to actively participate in governance 

 Motivation

As it stands Balancer liquidity mining encourages passive participation Liquidity Providers LPs simply deposit capital into the protocol and earn BAL Despite the significant subsidy LPs receive in the form of governance tokens theres no expectation or requirement that they actively participate in governance

This ultimately represents a misalignment as LPs have no incentive to vote despite constantly accruing voting weight If the suppliers are subsidized by the protocol with governance power they should be willing stewards of the protocol as well

This does not mean that LPs MUST participate but instead they should have an incentive to participate Therefore it may be worthwhile to incentivize those that service the protocol to help govern it as well aligning their participation with additional weighting to their weekly liquidity mining rewards 

 Specification

The govFactor is an onchain voting incentive for LPs that affects BAL liquidity mining allocations depending on whether or not an address voted on the last governance proposal The implementation multiplies BAL amounts each LP gets by their govFactor 11 for those who voted 10 for those who did not and then normalizes all amounts so that the sum is still 145000 BAL per week 

The govFactor will operate as an onoff switch where LPs that voted on the most recent proposal by signing a transaction turn on the factor

Providers that did not vote on the last proposal by signing a transaction have their govFactor off forfeiting the factor and in turn receive lower LP rewards than those that voted on the last proposal This dynamic will remain off until the next onchain proposal is open for voting and ratified onchain

If all LPs vote then the rewards remain the same as if no one votes

 To make calculations as simple as possible govFactor would be applied after all other factors

GovFactor looks at addresses who have voted on the most recent proposal featured on Snapshot and references to see if the address is also providing liquidity to the protocol If both variables are met the protocol includes a factor to their weekly BAL liquidity mining allocation

Its important to note that this reference happens entirely onchain meaning theres no need to crosslink any addresses to a forum or public username

Ultimately the govFactor creates a unified incentive for those that service the protocol to become active governance participants as well and should be considered by the community as a simple mechanism for encouraging governance participation from the protocols supplyside actors  

 Drawbacks

Some points to consider surrounding the GovFactor

 The end result could be a lot of nonengaged voting coming from LPs who dont hold meaningful amounts of BAL even if being large LPs and who dont really care about Balancer governance putting little to no effort in the decision process behind their votes
 The GovFactor encourages LPs to vote through their liquidity mining address which could pose some issues for opsec conscious users However Snapshot now enables delegation from cold wallets which would mitigate this issue 
 The cadence between different governance proposals is likely to differ This means that someone who votes on the last proposal preceding a large time gap to the next proposal may see increased liquidity rewards despite not actively participating in governance discussions
 The state of Balancer Governance is relatively idle and therefore implementing a governance incentive isnt currently necessary for the success of the protocol",23.744368429834807

As outlined in the updated whitelisting processhttpsforumbalancerfinancetproposaltoupdatethewhitelistprocess217 this is a proposal to increase the DEXG capFactor from cap1 to cap2 1M  3M

The Proposal

The DEXG liquidity on Balancer surpassed 3M with a total liquidity of 38M currently pooled Therefore we propose to increase the capFactor from cap1 to cap2

What is DEXG

DEXG is the governance token of the DEXToken Protocol The DEXToken Protocol creates a unique DeFi infrastructure featuring a revolutionary AMM and utilising the offchain capabilities of the Flowchain IoT network Currently the involved smart contracts are in open beta testing on the Ropsten Test Network The Mainnet launch is planned within Q1 2021",36.62287903667213
123,"This proposal also appears on Balancers forumhttpsforumbalancerfinancetproposalbalforgas1437 If approved changes would take effect at 0000 UTC on Monday March 8

On behalf of the Balancer community Id like to propose significant modifications to the ongoing gas reimbursement campaign We have heard some concerns that the campaign is confusing and that it isnt clear how much BAL a user will receive for a given trade During these times of network congestion and high gas costs we want to provide everyone with an opportunity to trade on Balancer With that in mind it doesnt seem fair to ask users to exercise blind faith and wait until next Wednesday to find out what theyve earned from trading We would like to make every effort to simplify the campaign and improve transparency what you see is what you get or at least as close as possible We plan to accomplish this by removing various sources of uncertainty from the reimbursement calculations so that it is possible to get an estimate ahead of time and display it to the user at the time of trade submission

 The Proposal
Allocate 30000 BAL from the Ecosystem Fund to the BAL for Gas campaign There is no fixed time period the budget is consumed on a firstcome firstserved basis When the budget is exhausted the campaign is suspended until it is replenished by BAL governance

For each eligible trade made through the Balancer Exchange Proxy award claimable BAL tokens to the trader An eligible trade is a trade containing one or more eligible swaps where an eligible swap is a swap between any two tokens on the whitelisthttpsgithubcombalancerlabsassetsblobmasterlistseligiblejson Claims are made available at the BAL claims interfacehttpsclaimbalancerfinance on Wednesday UTC time following the close of the weekly period 0000 UTC Monday  2359 UTC Sunday in which the trade occurred

The amount of gas to be reimbursed is predetermined by the number of eligible swaps within the transaction

table690x185httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard10uploadsbalanceroriginal1Xdd83c24ba43bd36e91396a5b6296f4c92cc986c2png

For converting gas to BAL use the median gas price of the enclosing block and the BALETH price from CoinGecko closest to the block time

 Motivation
The proposal above may seem familiar but there are some very important distinctions between this and the previous reimbursement program All modifications share the common goal of improving user experience which we believe is a matter of simplification and transparency

First this proposed campaign makes no effort to account for the _actual_ expenses of the user Both the amount of gas consumed by the transaction and the gas price ultimately paid are irrelevant Instead deterministic figures are favored the amount of gas is fixed depending on the number of swaps and the gas price is the block median rather than the users own price It is simply too difficult to accurately predict the parameters of a given transaction ahead of time whereas it is much easier to predict blockwide parameters Predictability informs transparency

The second major shift pertains to the budget The existing program allocates a fixed weekly budget which can sometimes necessitate cuts to the reimbursements in order to avoid excess spending Such cuts can only be known _after_ the weekly period has ended and therefore the existence of a weekly budget renders any tradetime estimates useless In contrast here we propose a fixed total budget which is distributed on a firstcome firstserved basis This allows us to add reimbursement estimates to the Exchange UI at the time of the trade If there are still funds remaining in the budget the user will see an estimate of the amount of BAL to be awarded and if the budget is exhausted then the user will simply be informed as such and the estimate will be zero When the well runs dry BAL governors can decide whether to replenish and continue the campaign

Third the BALETH price model is modified Whereas the ongoing campaign uses the median price for the whole weekly period the proposed campaign uses the price as close as possible to the actual block time Knowing the approximate price at the time of the trade allows us to make informed estimates about the amount of BAL to be awarded

image690x120httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard10uploadsbalanceroriginal1Xe00a59183e29b37e29369999caccc6035028b810png

Finally the fixed amounts of gas 130k 220k 300k 400k were chosen so that only 1 of all trades on average would be overcompensated This should be sufficient to prevent gaming the system for profit but nonetheless we reserve the right to filter out suspicious activity The Balancer Exchange UI will never perform more than four swaps in a single trade which is why only four numbers are provided any transactions containing 5 swaps must belong to bots whereas the target audience is end users We simply cap the reimbursement amount at 400000 gas any additional eligible swaps beyond the first four will yield no further benefit

 Mechanics
Although every effort is made to be as transparent and accurate as possible there is still a very small amount of room for error Here we will detail how the BAL amounts are computed both at trade time estimated and at dispersal time actual

At the time of the trade

1 Determine the number of eligible swaps An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the whitelisthttpsgithubcombalancerlabsassetsblobmasterlistseligiblejson
2 The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps 130000 gas for one swap 220000 gas for two swaps 300000 gas for three swaps and 400000 gas for four or more swaps
3 The estimated gas price for display purposes is the median from the last few blocks according to the getGasPrice function from the web3 provider This should provide a good corollary to the median of the actual trade block which cannot be known in advance
4 The estimated BALETH price for display purposes is queried from the large 8020 BALWETH poolhttpspoolsbalancerexchangepool0x59a19d8c652fa0284f44113d0ff9aba70bd46fb4 This acts as a realtime oracle which isnt worth manipulating because it is only used to display an estimate and not to compute an actual award amount
5 The user will see in one summary number the final result of 14 the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for this particular trade assuming there are still funds left in the budget A USD estimate is also provided for completeness with the BALUSD price being queried from CoinGeckos API

The UI changes are still being finalized but as a mockup consider the image below

image2485x500httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard10uploadsbalanceroriginal1X1174949f6ce920677d9102bbf6ee0a35627776b8png

At dispersal time computed by the open source mining scriptshttpsgithubcombalancerlabsbalminingscripts

1 Determine the number of eligible swaps An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the whitelisthttpsgithubcombalancerlabsassetsblobmasterlistseligiblejson
2 The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps 130000 gas for one swap 220000 gas for two swaps 300000 gas for three swaps and 400000 gas for four or more swaps
3 The actual gas price is the median from the block containing the trade We will filter out artificially lowprice transactions which are sometimes included by miners and can skew the median  these are typically 0gwei or 1gwei transactions
4 The actual BALETH price is queried from the CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade

It should be clear that the only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are most likely quite small the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block and the 8020 BALWETH price may not perfectly match CoinGeckos BALETH price All in all the user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time and this improved user experience should bring more traders to the campaign

This is a proposal to raise the liquidity mining cap from 100M to uncapped for AAVE

 The Proposal

After the activation of the Balancer Based Safety Module 20 Days ago the liquidity for AAVE quickly grew to be the Largest Balancer protocol Liquidity Pool as new LPs join the AAVEBAL incentivized Safety Module

image690x101httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard10uploadsbalanceroriginal1X464af158056f0a77cbf50195bfc2bb8a987826c1png 

Current APY by staking in the Safety Module is 2934 only considering the AAVE rewards The Pool is still growing and Balancer is now the best protocol to swap AAVE onchain

As BAL is a collateral option in Aave aBPT stakers can use their BAL rewards to unlock more borrowing power in the Aave Protocol

Uncapping the BAL rewards for the AAVEETH pool will allows even further incentive to bring more liquidity onchain and increase the synergies between the Aave  Balancer protocols

 What is The Safety Module

The Aave Safety Module acts as a collateral for the whole Aave ecosystem AAVE holders and now  with the new Balancer Based Stake  AAVEETH holders benefit from long term rewards for securing the protocol from insolvency while at the same time bearing the risk of being slashed in case of shortfall events
Having a very liquid onchain market and a consistent capital allocated in the Safety Module greatly increases the safety of the Aave ecosystem and the Aave protocol liquidity providers",41.45383104125737

 Background
The BAL for Gas initiative was introduced as a measure to entice and help users interested in trading ERC20 tokens through the Balancer trading platform

The introduction of the Gnosis partnership however will allow users to trade without requiring ETH for gas so the gas reimbursement program becomes obsolete

The initial proposal by rabmarut can be found herehttpsforumbalancerfitproposalbalancerexchangegasreimbursement705
The V2 Bal for Gas proposal by rabmarut can be found herehttpsforumbalancerfitproposalbalforgasonbalancerv21861

Given the conditions outlined above I propose stopping this initiative with immediate effect

 Risk Assessment
The halting of this program might result in a reduction in trading activity from those firsttime users not familiar with Balancer inner mechanisms claiming function and Gnosis

126,"This proposal appears on Balancers forumhttpsforumbalancerfitproposalboostedpoolsauthorizegauntletandtheballersmultisigtomanagepoolparameters2400

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week and the Balancer app now supports them too

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable Gauntlet and a multisig controlled by Ballers to control certain parameters of the Boosted Pools so as to increase their capital efficiency and returns to liquidity providers

 Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts  AaveLinearPool and StablePhantomPool  contain a series of parameters that affect their efficiency and can be tuned depending on market conditions

 Boosted Stable Pools  StablePhantomPool 
   swap fee
   amplification parameter
   token rate cache duration
 Boosted Linear Pools  AaveLinearPool 
   swap fee
   lower target
   upper target

Gauntlet has been managing fees and amplification factor in weighted and stable pools and would be able to do so for Boosted Stable Pools if this proposal is approved by the community

The duration of the token rate cache can have an impact on a boosted pools capital efficiency If the duration is too long the pool can be arbed for all the interest accrued on Aave since the last update of the cache A short duration mitigates this risk with the downside of increasing gas costs for trades

On Linear Pools swap fees are not collected by liquidity providers but rather act as an incentive for arbitragerskeepers to

1 withdraw main tokens from the pool deposit them in Aave and deposit the aTokens in the pool when it has main tokens in excess
2 withdraw aTokens from the pool withdraw the underlying from Aave and deposit the main token to the pool when it has a low balance of main tokens

The lower and upper targets determine a range within which no fee in imposed on trades between main tokens and Aave tokens A trader moving the balance of main tokens away from this range pays a fee to the pool which the pool then returns to traders that move the balance back towards the range

While were confident that Gauntlet can hit the ground running with respect to optimizing the swap fee and amplification factor of Boosted Stable Pools theres still much to be learned when it comes to the other four parameters described above For this reason this proposal would authorize a multisig held by Ballers to set those parameters Balancer Labs would monitor the activiy on the pools and the market conditions and advise on the the best course of action but Ballers would be the ultimate decision makers acting on behalf of BAL holders All updates would be announced in Discord beforehand

127,"This proposal appears on Balancers forumhttpsforumbalancerfitproposalboostedpoolsauthorizebalancerlabstoemergencypause2399

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week and the Balancer app now supports them too

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable a multisig controlled by Balancer Labs team members to control the Boosted Pools emergency pause mechanism during its first 3 months

 Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts  AaveLinearPool and StablePhantomPool  have an emergency pause period which is hardcoded at 3 months from the time the factories were deployed During the pause period the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise Funds can always be withdrawn by users  even during an emergency pause and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk

Since gathering 611 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient we propose also authorizing a Balancer Labs controlled multisig to pause the system  The BLabs Multisighttpsetherscanioaddress0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B will be controlled by a handful of team members at Balancer Labs Note that after the 3month pause period ends neither the Governance Multisig nor the BLabs Multisig will have any pause power

An important distinction between the pause mechanism in Boosted Pools and that of previous pool types and of the vault is that Boosted Pools are not supposed to be unpaused In practice after a pool is paused users should withdraw assets from the pool and a new pool should be deployed In the event that the pause mechanism must be triggered Balancer Labs will commit resources to draw attention from liquidity providers to the fact that they must withdraw their funds

Recently Fei Labs announced Tribe Turbohttpsmediumcomfeiprotocolthetribedaostronglybelievesthatahealthyandthrivingdefiecosystemneedsarobustplatformb1faea700dfa a way for DAOs to issue Fei at no cost into Fuse pools of their choice The Treasury subDAO has been evaluating this opportunity and believes there is likely market demand for users to borrow against their BPTs Balancer Pool Tokens while still earning any BAL or other token incentives Credit to Jared for preparing this helpful infographic which illustrates what will take place

As part of the recent treasury swap with Fei Balancer DAO has 245M FEI As an initial allocation to gauge market demand we propose to deposit 100k BAL into Turbo Fuse Pool x and borrow up to 10 of the current market value in FEI  we will also add 1M FEI from our current holdings for a total of 11  12M FEI to be deposited into Fuse Pool y

The Treasury subDAO will monitor the health of the FEI loan against our 100k BAL and either add more BAL collateral or pay down the debt using our existing FEI holdings to protect against any possibility of liquidation

The initial list of BPTs users can deposit into Fuse Pool y will be wstETHWETH WBTCWETH WETHDAI WETHBAL WBTCrenBTCsBTC FEIWETH bbfUSD Fuse boosted pool DAIFEILUSD and bbaUSD Aave Boosted Pool DAIUSDCUSDT As previously mentioned any liquidity mining incentives will still be captured so users do not miss out on any yield by using Fuse Pool y

Since Tribe DAO has a lot of experience managing Fuse pools the Treasury subDAO will let them manage Fuse Pool y However the Treasury subDAO will retain decision making authority around addingremoving BPTs and setting the maximum LTV for each BPT Any decision would be given to Tribe DAO to execute

An important final consideration is that any FEI borrowed through Turbo Fuse Pool x is subject to an 8020 split of the borrow interest with 80 going to Tribe DAO and 20 to Balancer DAO Treasury subDAO has provided feedback that a 5050 split would make increased usage of Turbo more palatable though for now the 8020 split remains the most likely reality Credit to Jared again for this comparison of both revenue scenarios

 KPI

Treasury subDAO is targetting a minimum of 50 utilization on borrowable FEI in Fuse Pool y as a sign that market demand does exist for borrowing against BPT collateral This metric will be assessed 30 days after our deposit into Turbo to show either this is a worthwhile allocation of capital or we need to reconsider the value add 

 Risks

 Turbo is a new product that while audited is untested There is the possibility of a smart contract bug which causes a complete loss of our BAL deposited as collateral to Fuse Pool x
   Mitigation Tribe DAO has offered to give us an OTC insurance quote This can be pursued if the Treasury subDAO feels it is appropriate

 If utilization of FEI is very high in Fuse Pool y and the price of BAL drops very quickly it may not be possible to withdraw FEI from Fuse Pool y to repay the FEI we borrowed from Fuse Pool x This scenario could result in liquidation of the BAL we deposited to Fuse Pool x
   Mitigation Treasury subDAO should be prepared to add additional BAL collateral andor use other liquid cashequivalent assets in Balancer DAOs treasury like USDC or FEI to repay the Fuse Pool x loan in an emergency Additionally it may take several days for the DAO Multisig to execute the necessary transactions which must be factored in
 Tribe DAO calls the loan in Fuse Pool x This would trigger a four week period where Balancer DAO must repay the FEI we borrowed in full or risk the BAL collateral being seized
   Mitigation Similar to the previous one We cannot rely on being able to withdraw FEI from Fuse Pool y in such an emergency so keeping cashequivalent liquid assets ready to use in this kind of situation is important
 Manipulation of the oracle that prices BPT in Fuse Pool y This could result in an exploit that drains funds from Fuse Pool y
   Mitigation BPTs represent full range liquidity  previous instances of this manipulation in Fuse pools has been the result of relying on a Uniswap V3 oracle which represents concentrated liquidity in a specific range Thus the risk of this exploit should be very low If it happens we might lose the FEI we deposited to Fuse Pool y so wed need to repay our FEI loan using our own funds

 Specification

The Treasury subDAO already has the authority to farm with idle nonBAL assets so only a social vote of the subDAO signers is required to allocate FEI from our current holdings into Fuse Pool y In order to make use of Turbo Fuse Pool x we require authorization from BAL token holders to use some of the DAOs BAL holdings

The Treasury subDAO requests that governance delegate us the power to allocate up to 500000 BAL to Turbo Fuse Pool x This will allow us to scale up from the initial deposit of 100000 BAL if we deem it appropriate

Specification for the transactions required from the DAO Multisig will follow once it becomes available",25.932835820895516

 Motivation 

Almost four months ago Balancers governance process was formally overhauled and handed off to the DAO through this proposalhttpsvotebalancerfiproposal0x3bbcaaad4f0a928b8dabaf97bfd9679752254aee6e63597df32a7453663354d6 Overall I would argue the revamp did increase the transparency and effectiveness of our governance process but some critical problems have become clear to me lately

The ultimate authority of our governance process is BAL token holders Currently in order for a proposal to proceed for a vote it must have a majority of the Gov Council signal that the proposal has reached soft consensus in the community Ballers and DAO contributors represent the majority of active community members Its not a stretch to imagine a scenario where large token holders support a proposal but the Ballersactive community do not We have created a system where the Gov Council acts as gatekeepers with full control over what proceeds to a vote and what doesnt

Thus I would make the argument that soft consensus in the community should NOT be a factor when considering a proposal to move forward to a vote We must avoid the situation where core DAO contributors are against a proposal that has large token holder support and that proposal does not proceed to a vote because it lacks soft consensus in the community

 Specification

The Gov Council will remain in place and their approval will still be required for a proposal to move to a vote However they will not vote on whether soft consensus in the community has been reached Instead the question will be Is this a well defined proposal

What is the criteria for a well defined proposal

 Includes a Motivation Specification and if applicable a Risks section
 If onchain execution from the DAO Multisig is required the Specification section must contain transaction details address to send funds to contract to interact withfunction to call etc
 The intent of the proposal must be clear not spam
 BAL token holders must have the power to implement the proposal
   Example A proposal is made to deposit the FEI in our treasury into a new degen farm As part of the subDAO formation proposalhttpsvotebalancerfiproposal0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66 the power to farm was delegated to the Treasury subDAO BAL token holders cannot vote on how we farm with nonBAL treasury assets so this proposal would not proceed to a vote However a proposal to remove the power to farm from the Treasury subDAO is within the scope of BAL token holders If this proposal passes successfully then the proposal to farm with FEI could go to a vote
   Example A proposal is made to deploy Balancer to Optimism Balancer Labs has sole discretion over core protocol development BAL token holders do not have the power to compel Balancer Labs to act It is solely the choice of Balancer Labs to create an official deployment of Balancer on Optimism or not Thus this proposal would not proceed to a vote as BAL token holders lack the power to implement it
   Example A proposal is made to deposit 100k BAL to Aave to earn a yield BAL token holders have the power to allocate BAL held in the treasury so as long as the other criteria for a well defined proposal are met this would proceed to a vote

If the Gov Council fails to execute their duties in good faith and votes against a well defined proposal proceeding to a vote a proposal to replace the Gov Council with a different mechanism should be made ASAP

Finally this proposal would also implement a required minimum quorum of 100k BAL Any snapshot vote that does not reach 100k total BAL voted AND at least 51 voting in favor would be considered to fail",25.932835820895516

This proposal aims to authorize an updated version of the Batch Relayer which adds unwrapping capabilities for ERC4626 tokenshttpseipsethereumorgEIPSeip4626 and UnbuttonTokenshttpsgithubcombuttonwoodprotocolbuttonwrappersblobmaincontractsUnbuttonTokensolL18 For reference the original Batch Relayerhttpsvotebalancerfiproposal0xedff802a4ffb1ba0e131c7d4126fa669648a9333860a74de57c9e5971b9ec541 enabled atomic sequences of swaps joins and exits as well as unwrapping of stETH and Aave aTokens Batch Relayer V2 retains all of those features from V1

This proposal seeks authorization for Batch Relayer V2 only on Polygon as it is anticipated that a Batch Relayer V3 will soon be available on all networks This intermediate release is targeted specifically at a new USD Boosted Pool on Polygon

The relayer would be granted authority to perform the following tasks on behalf of users who have opted into using it

 Leverage the users existing Vault allowances and internal balances to avoid duplicate approvals
 Swap on the users behalf
 Add and remove liquidity on the users behalf

 Motivation

The team at Overnighthttpsovernightfi who created the USD yieldbearing stable coin played a significant role in the development of the new ERC4626LinearPoolhttpsgithubcombalancerlabsbalancerv2monorepoblobmasterpkgpoollinearcontractserc4626ERC4626LinearPoolsol This pool supports tokens implementing the recently finalized EIP4626 Tokenized Vault StandardhttpseipsethereumorgEIPSeip4626 and the Balancer Integrations Team believes it has the potential to open up Boosted Pools to a plethora of yieldbearing tokens We thank Overnight for their patience throughout the integrations process and would like to add relayer support for their new pool as soon as possible

The relayer will enable trades involving the rebasing USD which is incompatible with the Balancer Vault It does this by unwrapping fromto the StaticUsdPlus token which is an ERC4626 token wrapper that removes the rebasing component This will effectively create direct markets for USD on Balancer not only via DAI USDC and USDT but also via multihop to any other connected token within the Vault For example the relayer would enable the following atomic DAIUSD trade

1 perform a multihop batch swap from DAI to StaticUsdPlus through the USD Boosted Pool
2 unwrap the StaticUsdPlus tokens from step 1 receiving plain USD tokens

 Risks

This proposal would only grant the required roles to the BalancerRelayer contract Each user would still be required to opt into the relayer by submitting an approval transaction or signing a message

The code is a simple wrapper over existing Balancer pool interactions and it has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the Balancer Labs team

The addresses of the BalancerRelayer and BatchRelayerLibrary mentioned in this proposal can be found in the official repohttpsgithubcombalancerlabsbalancerv2monorepopull1182commitscc113a4aaa9f3869a5accfdf236eafd6528a74d2

 Specification

The Balancer governance multisig on Polygon would submit a transaction to the Authorizer in order to grant the following roles to the BalancerRelayer

1 manageUserBalance  Utilize existing Vault allowances and internal balances so that a user does not have to reapprove the new relayer for each token
2 joinPool  Add liquidity to a pool on the users behalf
3 exitPool  Remove liquidity from a pool on the users behalf
4 swap  Trade within a single pool on the users behalf
5 batchSwap  Make a multihop trade or source liquidity from multiple pools
6 setRelayerApproval  Approve the relayer on the users behalf user must still provide a signed message

The Gnosis Safe at 0xd2bD536ADB0198f74D5f4f2Bd4Fe68Bae1e1Ba80 would send a transaction to the Vault Authorizer at 0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6 with the following data to authorize the BalancerRelayer at 0xF537dDd7f4cc72C6C08866b62EAe9378f1F62da8

 Summary

As a recap on 13 April 2022 a proposalhttpsforumbalancerfitproposalincorporationofthebalancerfoundation2989 was brought to the BalancerDAO or the DAO to incorporate the Balancer Foundation or the Foundation The Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work furthering Balancers decentralization goals and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem

The Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate and provides among others two primary benefits

It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts In addition for example it intends to establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto

It encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity at the direction of the DAO can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol  for example it could engage business development or tech providers

In short the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the BalancerDAO in the structure of the traditional business world

The Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment The Foundation Companies Act in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations

Running a Foundation Company comes with certain realworld costs and financial reserve requirements These are laid out below first in summary and then in detail for reference

 Specification  Foundation Expenses and reserves

This proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters effective April 2022 running through March 2023 and a selfinsurance reserve

 Foundation Expenses

The summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO Each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote If no changes are requested this proposal will serve as the governing decision

The Foundations fiscal year runs January to December so April  May June is the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 although it is the first quarter for which funding is requested

1 Q2 FY22  USDC 32941  actual expenses incurred through the end of May 2022 and forecast for June 2022  immediate payment requested
2 Q3 FY22  USDC 67919  for transfer 25 June 2022
3 Q4 FY22  USDC 67969  for transfer 25 September 2022
4 Q1 FY23  USDC 78384  for transfer 15 December 2022

The table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter Descriptions for each line item are included under the Detail section further below

 Foundation Self Insurance Reserve

As part of this proposal we are asking BalancerDAO to hold the equivalent of US500000 as a selfinsurance reserve earmarked for a year and to be revisited after a year The reserve can be maintained in BAL tokens given current market conditions but must at all times be available to the Foundation should it be needed and must be maintained at an equivalent value of US500000 More on this reserve requirement can be found in the Detail section below

Note the proposal is for funding at the Balancer Foundation level it does not include funding for

1 Balancer OpCo Limited the British Virgin Islands BVI subsidiary and operating company that will house the frontend development team for BalancerDAO
2 Other thirdparty service providers to the BalancerDAO such as Orb Collective and Kolektivo Labs

Proposals for funding these three entities will follow separately

 GovernanceSupervisory Services

 NonExecutive Director and Supervisor Responsibilities

Under the Foundation Companies Act 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company

Supervisor for a foundation company means a person other than a member who under the foundation companys constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties

The nonexecutive director responsibilities are

 To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them to delegate matters to the company secretary and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors
 To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation
 To work with the wider board of directors to
   set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors
   set an agenda for board meetings
   further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate
 Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate
 Along with other board members oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets establishing the Foundations efforts to further its mission
 Along with other board members oversee the Foundation CEO the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary
 Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director
 Set the tone to involve the Balancer ecosystem in developing longrange programs to support and increase all types of contributions to Balancer projects
 Set the tone to harmonize the ecosystem working with the board the service providers and projects and adjacent foundations to find opportunities to collaborate and reduce confusion

 Community Board Member duties

The Directors have ultimate responsibility for the management of the Foundation In particular the Directors responsibilities will include

 complying with all reasonable requests instructions and regulations made or given by the Board or by any duly authorized committee thereof and give to the Board such explanations information and assistance the Board may reasonably require

 attending all meetings of the Board in person or by videophone provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary as applicable with reasonable advance notice and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances

 bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO strategy policy resources performance and regulatory matters

 providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company including but not limited to adherence to terms set forth in the Articles

4 Compliance

 Responsible for all necessary filings responses to inquiries management of AML Compliance vendor and other Cayman Foundation compliance and riskrelated matters

5 and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation

 Legal Counsel

The Foundation may from time to time require advice on matters of Cayman law It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter For clarity this refers to the legal team rather than the corporate services team

 Self Insurance

It is typical for an organization to obtain insurance to protect itself against the legal regulatory and operational risks as well as to protect the directors and officers from personal liability for carrying out their duties We have not seen reasonable insurance for organizations of this nature in the market hence the need to selfinsure

We are asking for 500000 based on the costs of defending Balancer in the event of a regulatory inquiry class action or other lawsuit or vulnerability to the ecosystem The selfinsurance is based on recent DeFi matters within the last 12 months which have cost on average 100000 monthly to defend It is important to note that we have excluded any reserve for payment of damages fines or impact on users

Since this is a reserve and not an expense the Directors may assess in the future that a lower reserve amount becomes sufficient and propose changes to the DAO We are asking that the DAO bookmarks these funds to hold for selfinsurance

 Bank Fees

The Foundation is working to establish a bank relationship that we are advised could take approximately 68 weeks once the application is complete and submitted This line item is an estimateplaceholder for monthly fees

FIAT DAO is seeking the preliminary approval of veBAL gauges for two yettobedeployed stableswap pools

This comes after the successful migration of our governance token FDTs liquidity to the Balancer platform over the past month

Protocol Description
The FIAT protocol is a DeFinative repo market solution for providing liquidity to holders of fixed income assets It allows users of apps like Element Finance Notional Finance and Yield Protocol to bring their proofs of liquidity to the protocol in order to collateralize a debt position in FIAT a stable value asset Our v1 has just launched and itll look and feel familiar for users who have previously minted DAI RAI or MIM By utilizing proven stablecoin mechanisms the protocol is able to offer competitive borrowing power to holders of such collateral assets allowing them to releverage fixed yields or meet current liabilities as the locked assets mature You can learn more about its primary use case via this threadhttpstwittercomwjvillstatus1527680960866705408 from Element founder Will Villanueva

The success of FIAT is predicated on its ability to attract secondary liquidity In its current iteration it is pooling secondary liquidity around a singular asset drawing forward demand for an otherwise fragmented universe of collateral backing Unique to FIAT versus other CDP implementations is that fixed term collateral forces users to repay back their debt at a known point in time lest they bear negative yields due to FIAT interest accrual on those positions thereafter  this allows for higher maximum LTVs and potentially more trading fees for LPs Currently only stablecoindenominated collateral is supported by the protocol so any risk premium is a function of smart contract concerns or changes in prevailing yields

Motivation
Over the course of its first month in existence FIAT has had its liquidity subsidized on Curve via a discretionary budget Over the same time liquidity for our governance token has been ported to Balancer Weve been very pleased with the migration and think it makes sense to follow suit with FIAT here in its early days

A number of items excite us about the opportunity

 The presence of boosted staBAL and now FEIFRAXDAI pools will allow for user pathways that involve depositing into either minting FIAT and selling FIAT for more of the underlying in order to gain levered fixed exposure This results in locked TVL for Balancer and higher trading fees for Balancer LPs

 With Hidden Hand it will become possible to have a larger consortium of projects actively subsidize FIAT LPs We anticipate that all of our collateral partners with associated ERC20 tokens will see the value in deeper FIAT liquidity for their protocols And for other stableswap pools that exist on Balancer deeper FIAT liquidity increases the odds of locked TVL in their pools

 The user experience associated with veBAL and Hidden Hand is more clear than our current Curve  Rari Fuse flow

What we would like to discuss in this thread however is the deployment of the stableswap pools themselves Given the nature of FIAT ie CDP architecture stablecoin backing audited collateral issuers we would be interested to hear what members of the Balancer DAO have to say regarding their comfort with varying levels of potential A coefficientshttpsdocsbalancerficonceptsmathstablemath If you have any specific thoughts regarding this topic please share your opinion in the thread

Specifications

1 Governance FIAT DAO is a completely onchain organization with no corresponding real world entity in place The FDT token has been given away for free since November of 2021 and a DAO smart contract architecture has been live since December 2021

2 Oracles FDT is a standard ERC20 DeFi governance token that comes with the volatility inherent to the sector FIAT is a DAIlike asset that will come to be backed by less liquid derivatives but at the moment only supports collateral types with existing secondary markets

3 Audits Audits of our protocol and our collateral oracle system can be found in the Securityhttpsgithubcomfiatdaosecurity repo within our Github

4 Centralization Vectors FDT holders determine which assets are supported as collateral and the parameters associated with each A six of eleven guardian multisig currently holds certain emergency privileges

5 Market History FIAT has been transferable since April 2022 It previously reached a high watermark of 13M deposited on Curve

We would like to take this to a vote now that the FUD pool is live

As a reminder the DAO Multisig can tap a replacement from the approved replacements list at their discretion whenever the need arises Currently the only approved replacement candidate is

 Evgeny Yurtaev CEO at Zerion 0xcec0d1a31129af0b1088a3d8dfa6abb4bd1ecb45

 Specification

If approved the above listed candidates will be added to the approved replacement signer list and utilized ifwhen needed Kain has signaled his desire to leave the DAO Multisig due to being too busy with his other activities and he will be replaced with Mounir from Paraswap immediately Future changes will be announced via Balancers discord announcements channel and twitter",31.90578158458245

On April 18th the funding of the Balancer DAO for Q2 was ratified 1httpssnapshotorgbalancerethproposal0xe05bc1a898797cd8f78f86bed25bac84efade2df1a959daee09f8dd7c69d3b36 As part of the proposal 21250 BAL and 127500 USDC was requested for contributor compensation With the recent market downturn the ops multisig does not have sufficient BAL to pay the expected June Balaries See here how discounted veBAL compensation is calculated 2httpsbalancergrantsnotionsiteCompensationcb303e0241d94d96bed110929947029d  The proposal is to

 Motivation

Preservation of USDC available for the Balancer DAO can be the prudent choice in the current market conditions Therefore a swap of BAL from the DAO treasury  USDC from the ops subDAO Multisig  with the Balancer DAO treasury would retain USDC on the DAOs balance sheet and manage to pay the Balaries for June for people who are looking to get their Balary as discounted veBAL

 Risks if applicable

 While the ops subDAO made best efforts to poll contributors for their expected Balary the official determination will happen at the end of the month via our monthly healthcheck
 BAL price falls below 366 by the end of the month and a new proposal needs to be voted on to request the additional BAL due to the decreased price of BAL

 The Balancer Maxis are a passionate group of Balancer community contributors A center of excellence that keeps the Balancer ecosystem operating at a first class level As the protocol grows this teams responsibilities will likely grow with it We have picked up maintenance tasks from other organizations in the Balancer ecosystem as it continues to decentralize and would expect this to continue see examples below

 Leaders

Pledge to abide by the DAOs Code of Conduct or link to your own Yes

Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines Yes

 Domains of Operation

Multisig Management

 Linear boosted pool settings
 Swap fee and amplification adjustments
 Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL
 Adding new reward tokens to gauges
 Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees
 Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig

Expertise Besides setting swap fees this group has done all these tasks from day 1 Soon after we took control of swap fees from our friends at Gauntlet the protocol broke the previous record of 24h fees earned We believe our track record justifies our continued management of these multisigs until such time as governance approves another SP to take them over

Governance

 We serve on the Governance Councilhttpsforumbalancerfitproposalgovernanceprocessrevamp2324 and ensure continuity of Balancers Governance Process
 Active participants in discord and the forum on governance topics
 Several of us are delegateshttpsforumbalancerficdelegatecitadel14
 Advise projects on Balancers governance process
 Manage admin of the Governance forum
 We will pursue various strategic initiatives either individually or as a group at our discretion such as deploying to Optimism or the new Operating Framework
 In the cases that voting power in other protocols from tokens held in Balancers Treasury has been delegated to us we will represent Balancers interest in these votes

Expertise We helped to design Balancers governance system and are very active users of it It is safe to say our group has the strongest working knowledge of Balancers governance system outside of Balancer Labs For now it does require active management to ensure votes are carried out in an orderly fashion then properly executed We believe our track record here again speaks for itself and we will continue to operate in the same fashion we have been until governance approves a new governance framework or approves another SP to take these tasks over

Userproject support

 We manage Balancers discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed
 Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions
 We often deploy new pools for other projects
 Whitelisting and maintaining token lists
 We help with UI testing for Balancer

Expertise If you come to discord well likely be the ones helping you out We are also spread out in many chats with projects offering advice and performing routine necessary tasks as described above It is safe to say almost all projects that have used Balancer over the last year have spoken to one of us at some point We will continue to operate in this support capacity and offer any assistance we can to the community and the efforts of other SPs

Community

 We manage a Coordinape circle open to all DAO contributors
 Onboarding framework for new contributors
 Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO or between SPs
 Regular healthcheck on SP and community contributors with recurrent feedback

Expertise These initiatives were pioneered by some of our members over the last six months We will continue iterating and exploring these both with our in house knowledge but also in collaboration with the broader community

Record Keeping

 We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded
 Maintaining updating and improving official Balancer documentation as a bridge between the greater community and core development team

 Key Objectives  Success Metrics

Multisig Management

 Transactions are vetted for accuracy and executed in a timely manner
 Public discord channels are used for swap fee discussion so the community can provide input and feedback

Governance

 Balancers Governance system continues to operate in a fair and transparent manner
 We will continue being very active participants and leaders

Userproject support

 Discordtelegram chat questions will be answered in a timely manner

Community

 Coordinape will pay out promptly each month
 We will act as a touch point for any interested contributors to Balancer DAO

Global

 We commit to undertake all activities in public where reasonable We aim to responsibly grow the Balancer Maxis and this can only be done when the community is able to interact and engage with us There must be more opportunities for this in the future
 We will continue to facilitate the weekly Treasury meeting Tuesday 11am EST in discord open to the public This is a good opportunity for anyone in the community to talk to us about the Treasury or any other relevant topic
 We will facilitate a monthly community call where all SPs are welcome to join for their monthly updates This eases the burden on the community to attend many calls Again optional participation by other SPs

 Length of Engagement  Budget

3 months

Budget of 6875 BAL per month for salaries 1250 per person Danko at 625 which will be max locked in veBAL by contributors Additional monthly allocations of 100 BAL for gas costs and 4000 BAL for Coordinape

Total for 3 month engagement 32925 BAL

Impact on the Treasury The Treasury currently holds 4M BAL Funding the Balancer Maxis would cost less than 1 of the treasurys BAL holdings

Per recent discussionhttpsforumbalancerfitdiscussionkillcreamwethgauge3396 on the forum the community is split on this issue Governance did approve the CREAM gauge in a legitimate vote and BAL was bought on the open market and locked in veBAL to vote for it Governance also has the power to vote to kill any gauge for any reason and everyone participating in veBAL accepts these are the rules

The Balancer ecosystem has significant funding requirements that currently far exceed our revenue generation based on the last 30 days At this point in time the largest blocker to Balancer reaching sustainability is the existence of the CREAM gauge There is enough support in the community for killing the gauge that it is appropriate to move this to a vote in my view  this proposal will be sent to the Governance Council for approval next Thursday July 14th

Protocol Description

 InceptionLRT is an isolated Liquid Restaking protocol for Liquid Staking Tokens LSTs enabling the restaking of various LSTs with the initial focus on stETH and rETH Its core feature is the issuance of Isolated Liquid Restaking Tokens iLRTs for each restaked LST 
These iLRTs can be freely traded and used in other DeFi protocols while maintaining segregation from the underlying LSTs This architecture addresses potential risks associated with basketbased LRTs like increased complexity counterparty risk and often unclear pool rebalancing rules
InceptionLRT is specifically designed to bolster the EigenLayer framework by addressing a critical challenge the issue of liquidity locking in the protocol This advancement positions InceptionLRT as a key player in enhancing the fluidity and accessibility of restaking in the DeFi landscape


Motivation

 InceptionLRT aims to enable a gauge for instETHwstETH to substantially increase the liquidity of instETH while supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols

 Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust thirteen 13 total risk parameters across nine 9 Aave V2 assets including LTV Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus



 Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters based on previously selected community risk level preferences First a continuation of the two previous liquidation bonus updates AIP34 Liquidation Bonus Updateshttpsappaavecomgovernance30QmccRszk94JUyj3xGcBUxUzCo43jZDQYgesEULsudVjm9v and AIP38 Liquidation Bonus Updates for Eleven Aave V2 Assetshttpsappaavecomgovernance38QmciauyTVnoHG6bAXCxHjHqTsUfiDz7rSGFxMADqFgCh4z Second updated LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters to realign with the Moderate risk levelhttpssnapshotorgaaveethproposalQmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi chosen by the community 

 Motivation

This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk tradeoffs between specific assets While increased volatility affected most assets in the ecosystem some tail assets experienced even higher volatility and larger collateral usage supply that is significantly borrowed against In addition increased liquidity and decreased trading slippage for certain assets allow for lower liquidation bonuses

 Simple Summary
We propose adjusting two 2 AVAX risk parameters on the Aave Avalanche Market LTV and Liquidation Threshold

 Abstract
This proposal updates two AVAX risk parameters on the Aave Avalanche Market to align with the Moderate risk level chosen by the Aave community Index Coop has compiled the following analysis for Gauntlet and the broader Aave community to review

 Motivation
Updating the AVAX parameters seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk tradeoffs between specific assets

 Simple Summary

This ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when AIP47httpsappaavecomgovernance47QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH finishes at a further 30 reduced rate

In addition to tapering incentives on the Aave V2 market the ARC proposes introducing incentives on the Aave ARC market 10 of the 30 reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 ethereum market are to be applied to incentivising AUM on the Aave ARC Ethereum market

 Abstract

Liquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via AIP16httpsappaavecomgovernance11Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG renewed by AIP32httpsappaavecomgovernance28QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E and then incentives were reduced by 30 with the implementation of AIP47httpsappaavecomgovernance47QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH which expires on the 20th February 2022 A summary is shown below

 AIPX 1078 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
 AIPX 462 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market

Continuing on from AIP47 incentives on low vol assets are to be split 12 in favour of borrowers over lenders This logic will be applied to both Aave V2 and ARC markets High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave like Balancer and Chainlink

 Motivation

This proposal continues on from AIP47 with a further 30 tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior ARChttpsgovernanceaavecomtarcaavev2liquidityminingprogram90daysat30reducedrate5946 and shall last for another proposed 90 day period We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market

The incentive APR will fall even though TVL has reduced with market conditions so has AAVEs token price

In addition to incentivising Aave V2 Ethereum market I would like to present to the community an opportunity to commence distributing stkAAVE incentives on the Aave ARC market with the intention of achieving the following

1 Grow Total Value Locked TVL
2 Increase liquidity
3 Attractive low borrow rates
4 Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor
5 Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform

Within this proposal we will present two options for the Aave ARC markets Option 2 will reflect a Total Value Locked in Aave ARC of 250M This represents a 126x increase in TVL from what is a low base The next iteration of liquidity mining will likely see an increased allocation to Aave ARC as we continue to encourage users to interact with the market The initial target here is to grow Aave ARV to over 250M within the next 90 days and then pivot as required to support continual growth of the market

 Specification

The below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 21022021 up to and including 20052022

Key changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign

 30 reduction in incentives to 1078 stkAAVE per day on Aave V2 Ethereum market
 Introduction of 262 stkAAVE per day on Aave ARC Ethereum market
 Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value

The table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave V2 Ethereum market asset listings In estimating the Borrowing vAPR a 75 utilisation of the deposited assets was assumed This was based on the current DAI utilisation

 Rationale

The previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC reflects a desire to grow this mainnet market Incentivising the Aave ARC market is funded from the reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1540 to 11242 stkAAVE per day

Aarve ARC Option 1 we show what impact allocating 10 of the savings from the reduced Aave V2 Ethereum market would look like following a similar allocation strategy to the Aave V2 Ethereum market The mathematics assumes 75 utilisation of lending pools capital is borrowed which reflects the current utilisation of the DAI pool on the Aave V2 Ethereum market With zero wBTC deposited in the market and still very low capital being deposited this approach is heavily skewed towards USDC and mis represents what is expected with time

Aave ARC Option 2 we elected to view the incentives in line with 250M and assumed a distribution across the pools The distribution is an assumption and is quite different to the existing distribution on the Aave V2 Ethereum market We can easily change these parameters and are happy to do so The high level logic is to anticipate capital being deposited and then estimating what the vAPR from incentives would equate to For this we assumed 250M which is arbitrarily chosen as a nice round target it represents over 10x growth in the market TVL

 Discussion

The previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets Link herehttpsgovernanceaavecomtarcaavev2liquidityminingprogram90daysat30reducedrate5946 Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing Lending vAPY  borrowing vAPR  Borrowing Incentives vAPR  Lending vAPY

With the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas Time in the pool is also a huge factor and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so However it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider

With the introduction of incentives on Aave ARC even with around 250M deposited 60 in USDC the strategy would be profitable with a 75 utilisation rate This risks assets currently deposited in the Aave V2 Ethereum market being reallocated to the Aave ARC market If this was to occur the vAPR from incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market would increase It will be interesting to see what effect this has on the value deposited in each pool Pending how the market reacts to these proposed changes we can always revisit this and propose an amendment to the distribution schedule across both markets

 Economics

 Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around 445K per day during late January 2022 Daily aToken interest is around 19K per day
 Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost 168630 per day assuming 11242 stkAAVE at 150 per token Down from 231000 per day assuming 1540 stkAAVE at 150 per token Note previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of 320
 Ecosystem Reserve is worth around 29689M with an AAVE price of 150
 90 days at 11242 stkAAVE at 150 per token is 1518M or around 511 of the Ecosystem Reserve
 The Net spend is 122K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVEday Safety Module incentives
 Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue

AIP TBD
Title ARC  Add DPI as Collateral on the AAVE ARC market
Status Proposal
Authors MatthewGraham metfanmike Mringz 3SEHoldings
Created 03022022



 Summary

This proposal aims to begin the onboarding process for listing DeFi Pulse Index DPI as collateral on the Aave ARC market
 Abstract

DPI is the market leading DeFi themed indices product that presents investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to some of the largest DeFi names The DPI token an ERC20 is readily traded and has strong onchain liquidity DPI is currently supported by several large institutional investors making it readily accessible to large investors

This proposal presents an opportunity for the Aave community to begin the onboarding process in working towards an Aave ARC listing This will enable Aave to offer direct exposure to defi without needing to list several tokens and as we have seen from the Aave V2 Ethereum market listing there has been significant large investor demand for DPI
 Motivation

On the 21st August 2021 Aave was the first major lending protocol to integrate an index product into its platform The value of the DPI deposited into the Aave V2 Ethereum market quickly grew to over 60M Furthermore most of this 60M was supplied by a handful of addresses which shows there is market appetite amongst investors to deposit indices like DPI on protocols like Aave ARC

DPI is the market benchmark for DeFi and is becoming the investor grade standard for DeFi Adding DPI would dramatically increase support to help make DeFi more readily accessible to more traditional investors via the KYC approved Aave ARC platform Having already found strong support within the retail segment of the market with over 15600httpsetherscaniotoken0x1494ca1f11d487c2bbe4543e90080aeba4ba3c2b holders Index Coop believes listing DPI on Aave ARC as collateral with risk parameters in line with Aave V2 Ethereum market will be an ideal listing choice offering exposure to many leading DeFi protocols through a single asset listing Furthermore being a basket of tokens the volatility characteristics make DPI ideal for use as collateral

 Rational

DPI is a basket of 13 popular DeFi tokens available on Ethereum The methodology behind DPI is from Scalara formally Pulse Inc a subsidiary of DeFi Pulse The criteria for token selection can be found herehttpswwwscalaraxyz DPI is the most popular DeFi index product with 100m AUM and over 15600 holders

DPI is built on top of Set Protocol and managed by Index Coop Index Coop is a decentralized and autonomous asset manager governed maintained and upgraded by INDEX token holders

Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset

DPI would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem because it allows for a large pool of dormant capital 100m in non incentivized DPI AUM to find a productive use Additionally

 Significant Borrow Demand There is significant desire from whales to lend out the DeFi Pulse index and to use the DPI as collateral to borrow stablecoins for farming going leveraged longshort and implementing structured products eg carry trade
 Low Volatility Because indices are a basket of tokens they represent less volatility than the component assets by themselves
 Efficient Sector Representation Adding an index as collateral also gives exposure to all the component tokens while only having to add in a single token thus saving gas in Aaves system
 Liquidity via Primary and Secondary Markets Minting and redeeming represent the primary market of the indices but many users can buy and sell indices on the secondary markets  mostly Uniswap The price on the secondary markets are kept at Net Asset Value the market value of all the underlying components through a network of market makers that redeem the tokens when price is below NAV and vice versa

Additionally IndexCoop DAO is voting on a liquidity mining campaign to draw TVL to the Arc Market and give institutions a taste of the power of token incentives

 DPI for Institutions

IndexCoop the DAO issuer of DPI has relationships with Fireblocks a whitelister for the Aave ARC Market as well as BitGo and Coinbase Custody to provide institutional custodial options as well as deep liquidity through partnerships with market maker and ARC market participant Wintermute

Listing DPI will allow institutions to gain access to direct DeFi exposure without Aave ARC needing to list many tokens

 Specification

DeFi Pulse Index DPI should be whitelisted for use on the Aave Arc Market The address of the token on the Ethereum Main Network is 0x1494CA1F11D487c2bBe4543E90080AeBa4BA3C2b

title ARC  Consolidate Aave V1 V2  AMM Reserve Factors Purchase CVX and Deploy to Earn Yield
author Llama Community MatthewGraham Dydymoon 
created 03012022

httpsgovernanceaavecomtarcconsolidateaavev1v2ammreservefactorspurchasecvxanddeploytoearnyield6797


 Simple Summary

The Aave V1 V2 and AMM market Reserve Factors RF on the Ethereum network hold a combined value of over 2827MhttpsdunexyzllamaAaveTreasuryFinancesbyLlamaTrailing20Num20TimeSeries60 The Llama Community proposes consolidating the RF into the V2 RF and deploying the capital with the intention of retaining TVL and earning additional yield The yield generated comes with the added benefit of acquiring governance tokens of other DeFi protocols and increasing Aaves metagovernance influence

 Abstract

The Llama Community recommends implementing several yield generating strategies spanning Balancer Curve and Convex and subsequently participating in the respective communities tokenomic constructs Aave will earn yield in the form of swap fee income aToken yield derived from Aave V2 and governance token incentives in the form of BAL CRV CVX stkAAVE and LDO

The first investment theme is deploying capital into the Balancer Boosted Pool and BTC Stable Pool to earn a vAPY of around 134 and 46 respectively The Balancer Boosted Pool invests around 80 or more of the deposited liquidity into Aave V2 to earn yield whilst also generating swap fees stkAAVE and BAL rewards The Stable Pool generates income via swap fees and BAL rewards with the latter making up the majority of the incentives on both strategies

The second investment theme is more complex It involves acquiring both CVX and veCRV to participate in gauge weight voting on Curve in order to influence a portion of the CRV inflation schedules to be distributed to aToken pool Liquidity Providers LPs Aave will deploy stables and ETH from the RF to earn additional CRV and CVX rewards which will be used to further boost the incentive allocation to the aToken pools

The data presented here is accurate as of the end of December 2021 data

 Motivation

 Part A  Consolidation

The legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times There is only 219Mhttpsappv1aavecomhome of TVL remaining in the V1 market and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time

602x232httpslh4googleusercontentcomKqln89Od7cLnxfnd5sEq4gn6xMD2yrAocqa8nJOaXQoyjQ4GlNkgfw8pQ7E2skefYXPdtiqSLwWL_KtYcNiO6Qjciy0I296Q7eiz0R9_NEO1nhZSPJtMqReDXg4N7SOqTjzsEC

This proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1 V2 and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield The V1 RF holds around 821Khttpsetherscanioaddress0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae of assets at the time of writing whereas the Ethereum V2  AMM market holds 2745Mhttpsetherscanioaddress0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c of assets Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around 2827MhttpsdunexyzllamaAaveTreasuryFinancesbyLlamaTrailing20Num20TimeSeries60 A summary of the main assets held in the V1 RF are shown below

 Part B  Retain TVL  Increase Returns

Whilst holding aTokens is arguably one of the lowest risk yield opportunities in DeFi and something Llama Community encourages most if not all treasuries to hold The Aave DAO is fortunate since it receives income in the form of aTokens Thus Llama recommends firstly making all unproductive stable coins productive and then optimizing further by earning additional yield and metagovernance influence

The two main high level strategies proposed in this ARC share three common goals

 Retain TVL within Aave
 Exceed aToken returns
 Accumulate metagovernance influence

In addition to these three goals the Convex  Curve strategies have the added benefit of improving the extrinsic use cases for aTokens aToken holders will be able to deposit liquidity into the Curve aToken pools and then deposit the Liquidity Provider LP token into either Curve or Convex to earn additional yield

The Compound pool on Curve has 1745Mhttpscurveficompound of TVL relative to the Aave pool which has 553Mhttpscurvefiaave of TVLThis is most likely due to the higher incentive APR that the Compound pool 1013 vAPY relative to the Aave pool earning 758 vAPY on Convex

 Specification

 Overview

Llama proposes diversifying 2667M 9436 of the combined Ethereum RFs across three protocols Convex Curve and Balancer The combined Aave V1 AMM and V2 market RF totals 2827MhttpsdunexyzllamaAaveTreasuryFinancesbyLlamaTrailing20Num20TimeSeries60 at the time of writing A detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune DashboardhttpsdunexyzllamaAaveTreasuryFinancesbyLlamaTrailing20Num20TimeSeries60 and a highlevel overview is shown in the figure below

The actual implementation of this proposal is likely to be spread across several AIPs This is to reduce the implementation complexity and allow the several positions to be swapped  redeemed before being deployed into a bonding curve whilst we await the Chainlink CVX oracle being released and getting the Aave V2 RF whitelisted to deposit into the CRV locking contract to attain veCRV

The subsequent sections provide further insight into each strategy and how they are to be funded

 Convex  Curve Strategy

 Convex Allocation

The Convex CVX allocation is to be funded by the assets mentioned in the table below

602x372httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard21uploadsaaveoriginal2X4468f451db851df2f8c4ec9f3bc28fd81647492dapng

In order to fund the initial 2M purchase of CVX all of the AMPL BUSD and TUSD will be used 8422K and the balance 116M will be funded with USDC This is the initial purchase of CVX and with a unit price of 4320 is equivalent to about 46300 CVX tokens

We expect to make additional CVX purchases in order to meet the minimum voting hurdle required to influence how Convexs veCRV holding is deployed on Curve gauges Based upon this snapshothttpsvoteconvexfinancecomproposalQmRgsaGswSgzuzaiiH385StTGsv5TVdhAA1LWBGWR3yyLp and the Voting Rules and Informationhttpsdocsconvexfinancecomconvexfinancegeneralinformationvotingandgaugeweights section of Convexs documentation we estimate around 70000 CVX votes are needed to clear the hurdle rate This is expected to cost a further 102M to what is proposed above and represents less than 1 months revenue We intend to fund this through future revenue and have a sufficient buffer to the hurdle rate based upon voter participation on Convexs snapshot

The assets are to be converted to ETH and then used to purchase CVX via a Bonding Curve with a 50 bps premium that utilizes a Chainlink oracle price feed Alternative methods can be discussed in the comments However we opt for a solution that can be implemented entirely through the AIP governance process and does not include manual trading

AMPL is the most illiquid of the mentioned tokens and this position will need to be converted to ETH over a series of transactions Trades are to be routed through an aggregator with MEV protection like CowSwap The most liquid AMPL pools are on Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap Wherever possible aTokens will be swapped rather than redeemed in an attempt to retain TVL in the Aave V2 market

The newly acquired CVX will be locked for 16 weeks with voting rights delegated to Llama in order to vote on both Aave and sAave gauges via Convexs snapshot to increase the amount of CRV rewards received on the Curve pools Voting occurs every 2 weeks via Snapshot and thus the need for a delegate

The locked CVX also receives a portion of the protocol fee income and votes on how Convexs veCRV are distributed across Curves gauges Llama Community acting as the delegate will vote to boost CRV rewards on the Aave pool as a priority and sAave once sufficient voting influence has been attained

 4 Year Locked Curve veCRV Allocation

The aCRV tokens that have accumulated within Aave V2 are to be redeemed for CRV and then locked for 4 years on Curve to receive an equal amount of veCRV This strategy is subject to Aaves V2 RF being approved and whitelisted via Curves governance process

602x372httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard21uploadsaaveoriginal2X221477469e7d025cafd72614e98c3e6cd4e3236cfpng

The veCRV position will then be used to vote for CRV incentives to be allocated to the Aave and sAave pools via the respective gauges Based on the CVX strategy discussed prior these veCRV votes are likely to be allocated to the sAave gauge

Subject to the timeline and attaining the whitelist permission to deposit into Curves veCRV contract the alternative strategy is to convert CRV to cvxCRV then stake to earn CRV CVX and 3crv pulse any airdrops that go to veCRV holders This is expected to generate 4735 vAPY see snippet below

602x244httpslh3googleusercontentcomv6jyNfHVIrr7ovNveVCupxypxFTzoZfLAP3_aGSwRHVcNezLxZIPvmmLHitPMI7TzrFRm9GSRpimpcuJqnZLXOvJ5SUai1_2jStwPxr02Uyge60q2WDCx0dS4eU4GnwAblDACD

The earned CRV will be converted to cvxCRV and this will compound over time The earned CVX will be locked to increase Aaves voting influence and the 3crv will be exchanged for CRV then converted to cvxCRV to further compound the strategies returns over time

 Productive aToken Stable Strategy

The sAave and Aave strategies include depositing capital into a Curve pool and then staking the LP token on Convex to earn stkAAVE CVX and CRV rewards The two strategies are expected to generate around 407 vAPY and 619 vAPY before Aaves CRV and CVX voting influences the CRV incentive derived yield

The table below shows the allocation how each strategy is funded and which pool those funds are to be deposited into

602x244httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard21uploadsaaveoriginal2X003ca5c3d9bf70c960c6769e35b6a630d64b6ce18png

 Productive ETH Strategy

After transferring the ETH from Aave V1 RF to Aave V2 RF the awETH is to be redeemed for ETH and the combined ETH deposited into the Curve stETH pool The LP token steCRV is to then be deposited and staked in Convex to earn CRV CVX and LDO incentives The expected yield is around 665 vAPY

602x244httpsaws1discoursecdncomstandard21uploadsaaveoriginal2X33d101f6f395bb1310f0d58031136da366e6ee838png

No vlCVX or veCRV voting rights will be used to attract CRV incentives on this pool as the pool does not contain any aTokens

 Balancer Strategy

 Balancer Boosted Pool Strategy

Balancer has recently launched the first Boosted Poolhttpsappbalancerfipool0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000feutm_sourcewebsiteutm_mediumbannerutm_campaignaaveboostedpools on Wednesday 16th December and liquidity mining incentives have already commenced generating around 134 vAPY at the time of writing Using the Stable Poolhttpsappbalancerfipool0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42000000000000000000000063 as a guide we expect Balancer to grow the Boosted Pool with the use of Liquidity Mining LM and even replace the Stable Pool in time

The Balancer Boosted Pools earn swap fee income LM incentives and a new type of yield derived from unproductive capital being deposited into Aave V2 to earn yield Llama expects the yield of the Boosted pool to exceed the Stable Pool in order to entice users to move across Llama expects LM incentives to be the mechanism for achieving an elevated return while the pool is in its bootstrapping phase

The strategy for Aave is to deposit an equal amount of DAI USDC and USDT into the Boosted Pool All BAL rewards are to be retained to accumulate governance influence

Forum post Listing proposal add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyonhttpsgovernanceaavecomtlistingproposaladdjeuronaavev3onpolyon7353


 Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Networks jEUR a synthetic euro stablecoins on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon jEUR is a liquid and capitalefficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC and with a working 0fee fiat on and offramp jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curves pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity

 About Jarvis Network
Synthereum is the first protocol of the Jarvis Networkhttpsjarvisnetwork It provides a capitalefficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs on Ethereum Polygon Gnosis Chain Avalanche and the BNB Chain

jFIATs main feature is their convertibility for their collateral USDC on Polygon and for other jFIATs at the oracle price without price impact enabling a 0slippage onchain Forex This feature makes them usable since one can convert them for USDC at any time they keep their peg and have the same market depth as USDC and therefore are very liquid

The protocol is integrated within Paraswap so users can swap jEUR for any other token

We have partnered with Mt Pelerinhttpswwwmtpelerincom a Swiss regulated entity to provide users with a 0fee 11 fiat on and offramp directly on Polygon and other EVM chains Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon back and forth One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices salaries rent and even taxes since July last year

Combined with Paraswap this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros at a better rate than most CEX including Binance Kraken etc

We also have launched jXAFjXOF which are wrappers of jEUR XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro to address the African market  we are building a fiat on and offramp in Africa Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAFjXOF holders

jEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price therefore other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg or simply to access greater liquidity

We debuted on Polygon around September Currently version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR A second version of the protocol without those limitations will be launched soon

The protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works 625k of USDC has enabled since October

 35M jEUR in circulation 4M
 78M of volume on our primary market
 33k swaps by 9k users
 20M of transfers wallet to wallet excluding swaps
 50M on secondary markets Curve Kyber
 10M of fiat on and offramp
 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders

 Benefits for Aave V3
 Fiat on and offramp
jEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and offramp which can create a direct bridge between banks and a Euro savings account on the Blockchain

We have multiple nonindividuals companies who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs like on Curve

Having jEUR on Aave combined with our fiat onramp would allow this use case to become a reality and would allow users to borrow jEUR and offramp them for Euros

 Large addressable market
A part from the Euro zone jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the endusers people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it in reality we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR but the enduser wont see it

 jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins
jEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon

 DDM
jEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets to maintain a lowinterest rate if needed

 Low risk collateral
As collateral jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buyingselling it on our primary market

jEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave

jEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades


 Risk Parameters
With the liquidity on Polygon in mind I propose the following risk parameters Obviously this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters

1 V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins if it exists 97 LTV 98 liquidation threshold 10 reserve factor
2 V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins 90 LTV 95 Liquidation threshold 10 reserve factor
3 V3 Isolation mode 50 LTV 80 liquidation threshold 20 reserve factor 2M debt ceiling

 Security specification and risks

 Risks inherent to jEUR
Besides obvious smart contract risks jEUR is overcollateralized with USDC and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC

jEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMAs DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols


More informations about the riskshttpslearnjarvisnetworkprotocoloverviewrisks


 Token  Protocol permissions minting and upgradability
jEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon users can send X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint X of jEUR or the multisig can call the minting function from the DDM module

There is currently no DAO only a communityowned multisig 58 managing the treasury and two companyowned multisig 23 one admin and one maintainer the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols minting and burning fees address receiving the fees addingremoving a new jFIAT addingremoving supported collateral calling the emergency shutdown function settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed changing the price feed

It does not have any accesscontrol over any funds and we are transitioning to a vemodel together with a token rebranding in Q2 accompanying the launch our the protocol v2

Proposal to add support for MAI aka miMatic on Aave V3 On Polygon Fantom and Avalanche

 Summary

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is noncustodial All MAI is backed by collateral locked in usermanaged vaults MAI minting is available on 8 chains and bridging to 18 chains

All accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns

Theres around 250M MAI minted with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom

 Risk Parameters

 V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins 97 LTV 98 Liquidation threshold 10 reserve factor
 V3 Isolation mode 75 LTV 80 liquidation threshold 10 reserve factor 50M initial debt ceiling per chain

 Specifications

1 What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset

Core team at QiDao Protocol

2 Provide a brief highlevel overview of the project and the token

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0 interest

MAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon Avalanche Fantom Arbitrum Harmony Moonriver and Gnosis Chain MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi currently on 18 chains through Multichain Accepted collateral includes interestbearing assets like Aave Market Tokens Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI  instead they are charged a 05 fee upon repayment

Despite market downturns during its existence MAI has maintained its peg

MAI currently has a TVL of around 350M and has around 250M MAI outstanding

3 Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset
Being the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI

MAI is one of the most crosschain assets available on 18 chains through canonical bridging As a result users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has

MAIs risk profile is low It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon MAI has also received grants from several blockchains including Polygon Fantom Harmony Aurora and IoTeX

4 Provide a brief history of the project and the different components DAO is it live products are the live How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced

 MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol a communityrun DAO around the QI token
 Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing including Frax Finance Stake DAO Celsius  PolygonDAO SpiritSwap SpookySwap Gotchi Vault and Beefy Finance
 The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao

5 How is the asset currently used

 Lending Marketxyz Impermax Tarot
 Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains Main DEXs are Curve Balancer QuickSwap SpookySwap SpiritSwap Solidly Saber and TombSwap
 Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon
 MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM
 MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties
 MAI offers lowcost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO Yearn Beefy and Aave

6 Emission schedule

Users can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0 interest Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation

7 Token  Protocol permissions minting and upgradability Is there a multisig What can it do Who are the signers

All funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users
There is a 35 multisig comprised by the QiDao team Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts live streams and crypto conferences
The multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes liquidation ratios for new collaterals partnerships and debt ceilings There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO see votes here 1
Since the protocol uses canonical bridging QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to

146," Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust six 6 total risk parameters including LTV Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across three 3 Aave V2 assets In addition Gauntlet recommends freezing legacy KNC 

 Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the Moderate risk levelhttpssnapshotorgaaveethproposalQmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi chosen by the Aave community These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations


 Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk tradeoffs between specific assets

Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics insolvencies liquidations and borrow usage Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function Our agentbased simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis including but not limited to asset volatility asset correlation asset collateral usage DEX  CEX liquidity trading volume expected market impact of trades and liquidator behavior Gauntlets simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics As such the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation The individual collateral pages on the Gauntlet Risk Dashboardhttpsgovgauntletnetworkaave cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations

 Specification


Our recent market downturn reporthttpsgovernanceaavecomtmarketriskmonthlyfebruary2022updatesandreview7476 showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies as our simulation models have predicted We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels

 Freezing Legacy KNC

The KyberDAO approved the proposal to migrate KNC token contracthttpsgithubcomKyberNetworkKIPsblobmasterKIPskip6md to a new implementation on 4202021 which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently As of 3282022 roughly 195M of KNC have migrated to the new Kyber Network Crystal KNChttpsetherscaniotoken0xdefa4e8a7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202 and 57M of KNC are still in the old KNC Legacy KNCL contracthttpsetherscaniotoken0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200 There are currently 29M KNCL supplied and 900K total borrowed on Aave v2

Considering that exchanges eg Krakenhttpssupportkrakencomhcenusarticles4401758213268KyberKNCtokenmigration Cryptocomhttpsblogcryptocomcryptocomsupportsthekybernetworkknctokenmigration have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform

147," Summary
1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1 Since then 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol Limit Order Protocol P2P transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet

This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token 1INCH as a collateral asset in Aave

 Motivations
Launched in 2019 and with over 60 of the market share 1 the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space The 1inch Networks metrics are below source 1

Total trading volume 160B
Total swaps 591M
Total users 125M

1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network 1INCH has a circulating market cap of 500M 1 a daily trading volume of 50M and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase Binance FTX Gemini and Kraken In addition to the spot markets 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange

The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation  the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 15 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4

In December of 2021 1inch Labs completed a 175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors

 Benefits to Aave Community

1INCH is highly liquid
1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms so Aave will have a firstmover advantage
1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets  there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH
1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020 to accredited and institutional investors who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds

2 Provide a brief highlevel overview of the project and the token
1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols revenue stream 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program 3

3 Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset
1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space

1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance FTX and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX

1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020 to accredited and institutional investors who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds Currently none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling

On the demand side users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program or support specific governance proposals

4 Provide a brief history of the project and the different components DAO is it live products are they live How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced

The 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1 Since then 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol Limit Order Protocol P2P transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet

1inch Aggregation Protocol The 1inch API v4 Pathfinder is a cuttingedge discovery and routing algorithm which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time

1inch Liquidity Protocol 1inch Liquidity protocol previously called Mooniswap is an AMM that aims to offer capitalefficient liquidity positions while protecting users from frontrunning

1inch Limit Order Protocol 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders and RFQ Orders which later can be filled onchain Both types of orders are a data structure created offchain and signed according to EIP712 Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency

P2P Transactions 1inch PeertoPeer allows two users to make an overthecounter style trade of any ERC20 token
1inch Mobile Wallet The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a builtin DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions

Supported Networks 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks Ethereum Binance Smart Chain Polygon Arbitrum Optimism Gnosis chain Avalanche and Fantom

 How is the asset currently used

1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network Since November 2021 all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1 The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals Instant Governance or benefit from the gas refund program 3

Emission schedule

The 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4

Of the 15B total future supply 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 when the maximum supply of 15B is reached

Uncirculated 1INCH is held in onchain vesting contracts v1INCH is the nontransferable ERC20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract There are 107B v1INCH these are included in the 15B total future supply

 Token  protocol permissions and upgradability

The smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded  new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance

The 1INCH token is nonupgradable The tokens mint function previously controlled by a mutlisig was recently burned 4  there will never be more than 15B 1INCH

 General

The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1 Since then the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol Limit Order Protocol P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities the 1inch Foundation 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately

 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community The foundation issued the 1inch token however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract The 1inch Foundation holds around 2818835556 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig
 Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs
 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of onchain smart contracts The 1inch DAO has control amongst others over the 1INCH token DAO Treasury 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing
   1INCH The unstaked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals
   st1INCH A non transferable ERC20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocols governance contract This has a Voting Weight of 100 There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively
   v1INCH This is an ERC20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract These tokens are held by backers advisors and core contributors but are not yet fullyvested Each v1INCH has 15th 20 the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH

The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAOs treasury A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury

 1INCH Smart Contract Risk

The 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020 Since then it has done over 250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M

The 1INCH token is an ERC20 token with no governance influence held by around 88475 wallets and the staked INCH token st1INCH used for governance is held by around 5391 wallets The staking contract holds 2021880081 INCH tokens at the time of writing

The 1inch Foundation although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately 15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value

On April 6th 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH

 1INCH Counterparty Risk

1inch is a permissionless protocol where 1INCH holders do not have a say in how the protocol or DAO is governed

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals Instant Governance or benefit from the gas refund program

The st1INCH token is used for governing the DAO and although there is no revenue sharing like with xSUSHI there are economic rewardsincentives for those who hold the token st1INCH token holders receive up to 100 of gas expenses refunded depending on your stake size Under this program 1INCH tokens are distributed as a gas refund to Ethereum users who stake 1INCH tokens through the 1INCH dApp Borrowing 1INCH with the intent to receive a gas refund is a useful utility

Users who stake 1INCH receive st1INCH which is non transferrable and used for governance If a malicious actor was to borrow 1INCH stake to receive st1INCH and then try attack the DAOs treasury then the Treasury Multisig 7 of 12 can veto the proposal during the 72 hour timelock period post successful Snapshot vote This measure provides a level of protection for the DAOs Treasury funds which are nominated in USDC Any malicious attack on the DAO Treasury would not lead to the actor selling 1INCH onmarket and this scenario would not create bad debt by moving the spot price of 1INCH

 Paragraph Summary

LUSD is stablecoin minted directly by the protocol users by opening a Trove and depositing ETH as collateral Loans are interestfree with a 05 base initiation fee All the contracts of the Liquity protocol are immutable which makes LUSD the most trustless stablecoin currently available on the Ethereum mainnet

LUSD is overcollateralized by ETH with two main mechanisms helping it keep its peg first LUSD can be redeemed for ETH at face value ie 1 LUSD for 1 of ETH Secondly there is a minimal collateral ratio of 110 Both mechanisms respectively create a price floor and ceiling through arbitrage opportunities

Since the protocol is immutable no additional developments are planned yet the Liquity team is working on another project that will prove synergetic with LUSD

LUSDs resilience makes it a highly soughtafter stablecoin for DAOs and protocols looking to diversify their treasury and users looking for costeffective leverage on ETH The current focus is to grow the DeFi ecosystem around LUSD to enable more diverse use cases

This proposal aims to add LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave v2 mainnet 0 LTV If the current proposal is met with enthusiasm other proposals will follow suit

 Specifications

 AIP author status

I TokenBrice author of this ARC recently joinedhttpstokenbricexyzjoiningliquity the Liquity team to help with DeFi strategy

 Overview of the project and token

Liquity is a protocol offering costefficient leverage using ETH as collateral While its base design can be described as similar to MakerDAI there are several key differences

 Only ETH is accepted as collateral to maximize the protocols trustlessness and resilience
 There is no interest fee on Liquity Instead the borrowers pay a predictable initiation fee starting at 05  and ramping up algorithmically when needed to protect the protocol
 Liquidations are close to instant and enabled by a protocollevel backstop the stability poolhttpsdocsliquityorgfaqstabilitypoolandliquidations a reserve of LUSD deposited by users
 Just like Aave Liquity uses ChainLink as the main price feed However there is a fallback systemhttpsdocsliquityorgfaqstabilitypoolandliquidations in place switching to Tellor if the ChainLink price feed data is deemed incoherent
 Since the contracts are immutable there is no governance There is still a token associated with the protocol  LQTYhttpsetherscaniotoken0x6dea81c8171d0ba574754ef6f8b412f2ed88c54d but its used for incentivization and feesharing purposes only
 The minimal required collateralization ratio is lower  at 110 increasing the capital efficiency of the protocol This is possible thanks to the stability pool and instant liquidation mechanism which also helps maintain the peg by acting as a liquidity buffer A failsafe mechanism called the Recovery Mode is triggered when the total collateralization ratio of the protocol falls below 150 Being an exceptional measure the Recovery Mode enforces more substantial restrictions on the Troves such as temporary minimal collateralization of 150 until the total collateralization ratio of the protocol recovers So far it was only triggered once in the early days of the protocol

 Positioning within Aave Ecosystem

LUSD is a stablecoin offering some genuinely unique features the leading one being the trustlessness of the whole Liquity protocol In that sense LUSD is one of the most resilient stablecoin and the most decentralized Similar to the addition of RAI on Aave having LUSD will help Aave diversify from the current dominance of centralized stablecoins such as USDC used for borrowing

Furthermore as mentioned above this proposal is the first step Several others could follow to nurture the relationship between Aave and Liquity further

1 Enablement of LUSD as collateral LTV0
2 Enablement of efficiency mode against selected stablecoins once v3 mainnet is live
3 Addition of LUSD on AaveOptimism  potential enablement as collateral  again enablement of the efficiency mode

I believe that LUSD as a borrowable asset will be met with a strong demand it will be the first time such a resilient stablecoin could be borrowed on Aave and the first protocol where LUSD is borrowable

 History of the project and its components

The Liquity protocol was launched on the 5th of April 2021 As the code is immutable there has been no update since then However the team is still actively working on the protocol DeFi integrations such as supporting LUSD liquidity on Curve

Since the demand for LUSD is directly dependent on the appetite for leverage on ETH the LUSD supply had varied quite a bit since the launch with the highest point around 15B LUSD when ETH reached a peak price of 4K The following correction on ETH with the lowest point around 2K led to a drastic reduction in the LUSD supply  this episode is the first and so far unique time when the Recovery Mode was triggered Since this episode the supply has stabilized more and is now around 325M LUSD This episode was the first massive stress test for the Liquity Protocol which handled it gracefully  a recap is available here

 A Curve pool integration on Convex and Yearn was created against the 3Pool and became the main liquidity source Its amongst the stablecoin pools with the highest base APR due to the trading volume it processes
 DeFiSaver offers some automation features to streamline Troves management
 BProtocol delivered an autocompounder for depositors of the Stability Pool who wish to keep a 100 LUSD exposure httpsappbprotocolorgliquity
 Some protocols such as Olympus or Fei Protocol diversified part of their treasury to LUSD to shield themselves from volatility with an unstoppable stablecoin Synthetix is also using LUSD on Optimism to stabilize the sUSD price

 LUSD usage

A sizeable share of the LUSD supply 66 is deposited into the Stability Pool the liquidity backstop for liquidations httpsetherscanioaddress0x66017d22b0f8556afdd19fc67041899eb65a21bb

The top LUSD holders also include other protocols such as Olympus DXdao or some treasuries

LUSD is also present on Optimism where Synthetix provided a wrapper contract to help stabilize the sUSD price 45M LUSD  to provide liquidity on Velodrome the pool is 9M TVL against USDC

 LUSD Emission

The only way to mint LUSD is to open a Trove while LUSD is burned through debt repayment either directly by the trove owner or through redemptions by an arbitrageur

 Token  Protocol Permissions

The LUSD token as well as the whole Liquity protocol are fully permissionless There is no multisig and no governance and noone can interact with the contract underlying the protocol in an administrative manner all users are the same in front of the contract just like with Uniswap v2 for instance

 Market Data

As of June 03 the total LUSD supply is around 325M There is about 90M of total liquidity in pools where LUSD is involved

The main liquidity source for LUSD is the Curve pool with 65M TVL httpscurvefilusd

There are also liquidity sources against FRAX USDC and DAI on Uniswap V3 httpsinfouniswaporgtokens0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0

There is a 4tokens pool on Saddle Finance alUSD FEI FRAX LUSD with 25M liquidity httpssaddleexchangepoolsD4deposit

Finally on Optimism LUSD is the largest stablecoin pool with around 9M against USDC httpsappvelodromefinanceliquidity0x207addb05c548f262219f6bfc6e11c02d0f7fdbe

The observed volume can vary depending on the markets activity massive ETH price movements are usually followed by days with large volume with a baseline around 3M daily volume mainnet only

 Social channel data

The main channel for the community to gather is the Liquity Discord server with around 65K members For outwardfacing communications the main channel used is the LiquityProtocol Twitter account with over 285K followers We also regularly publish newsletter updates to subscribers 25K and have recently become more active on LinkedIn 1K

 Risk Assessment

We followed Aaves risk assessment methodologyhttpsdocsaavecomriskassetriskmethodology to provide all the necessary metrics

Im not sure what the proper rating is for a stablecoin with no governance and immutable code should be when it comes to the Permission category so I went with an A to reflect that in that regard LUSD is almost as safe as ETH Feel free to challenge me if you think that is not appropriate

 Paragraph summary
We would like to ask for your support in listing RSR Reserve Rights Token as an asset to borrow RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both a insures and b governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol

 Motivation
The Reserve team is launching the Reserve protocol in fall of 2022 From that point on the Reserve Rights RSR token will serve the purpose of a insuring and b governing stablecoins created on the Reserve protocol RTokens

The Reserve protocol GitHub  reserveprotocolprotocolhttpsgithubcomreserveprotocolprotocol is building on Aave by a integrating aTokens as collateral and b using the protocol oracle to determine price during valuation and auction functions if listed on Aave as borrowable asset

We would prefer to use the Aave oracles for the simplicity of our protocols design and the code has already been included in our ongoing audit To do so this requires RSR to be a borrowable asset on Aave

When RSR is staked on a particular Reserve stablecoin RToken it may receive a portion of income from the respective RTokens full collateral basket Because of this we anticipate demand to borrow RSR in order to stake or hedge staked positions Aave would be the only platform where this would be possible as of now

 Specifications
 Link between the author  the project 
The Reserve team
 High level overview of the project 
The mission of the Reserve project is to help people cope with the effects of high or hyperinflation and aims to eventually eradicate it The project does this by developing a stable cryptocurrencies b a mobile application to exchange local currencies with the stable cryptocurrencies and c a protocol that insures  governs them
 
imageipfsbafkreiaxl7iig3h3eceftb6qulbqugv52vmwndiv6da44y7zb6lrre6ole
The Reserve app is currently available in Latin American countries where hyperinflation has had the most significant impact Venezuela Argentina Colombia  Panama It currently has 600000 registered users and 120000 weekly app visitors who use the Reserve stablecoins for daily purchases such as paying for groceries paying bills etc This video shows how some of our customers use our stablecoin daily httpstinyurlcommudrhh4d

The Reserve Rights RSR token is the governance token used to insure the stable cryptocurrencies against collateral defaults and while staked is also used to govern the RTokens collateral changes etc

A key point is that when RSR is staked on a particular RToken it will typically  determined by governance receive a portion of the income of the entire RTokens collateral

 We define an asset as stable if it never depreciates and generally appreciates over time relative to its backing assets

 Why would RSR be a good borrow asset
We anticipate that the yield on stRSR will drive demand to borrow RSR for two primary purposes a to hedge against price changes on an existing stRSR position and b to borrow with intent to stake for the stRSR yield

These are both well known strategies in DeFi and TradFi and we dont expect that to be any different with RSR Furthermore we have received a significant amount of requests from our community but have delayed on making this request until we were closer to launching our platform

Aave would be the first and currently only place to borrow RSR in DeFi and as a result we anticipate there to be demand

By listing RSR as a borrowable asset Aave would become the first DeFi protocol that allows borrowing RSR and could therefore benefit from the borrowing demand from the RSR community and potentially other parties

 Brief history of the projects components
The main relevant components of the Reserve ecosystem are the Reserve mobile app and the Reserve Protocol

The Reserve app has been fully open access to users in the aforementioned countries since September 2021 The full version of the Reserve protocol will be live sometime in 2022 We anticipate this happening in the early Fall although as with all development work this could be a bit sooner or later

An initial concept of fully collateralized stablecoins was launched in 2019 and since then the team has been working on the fully decentralized and permissionless platform that will allow for the creation of fully collateralized yield bearing and insured stablecoins Full details on this updated version can be found here Protocol description  Reservehttpsreserveorgprotocol2021_version

 How is the asset currently used
At this point in time the Reserve Rights RSR token serves as a placeholder token From this year onward the token will be used for two main purposes
1 RSR holders can stake their RSR on any Reserve stablecoin RToken to insure it against default of one of the collateral tokens and in return may receive a portion of the yield generated by the collateral backing RTokens
2 RSR holders can govern Reserve stablecoin to help decide on its future eg collateral assets backup assets locking periods etc
 Emission schedule
The total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens out of which there are currently 183b in circulation The remaining 817b RSR tokens are locked Out of these 494b tokens belong to the Slow Wallet 155b to seed investors and strategic partners and 168b to team members and advisors

The Slow Wallethttpsetherscaniotoken0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70a0x6bab6EB87Aa5a1e4A8310C73bDAAA8A5dAAd81C1 is a locked wallet controlled by the Reserve project used to fund RToken adoption initiatives like listings partnerships marketing etc Its under the discretionary control of the Reserve team However it has a hardcoded 4week delay after initiating each withdrawal transaction on the blockchain Upon initiating a withdrawal transaction the team announces the purpose of the withdrawal either through a public onchain message or on social media If RSR holders do not agree with the purpose of the withdrawal they are able to sell their RSR in the 4week period before the project is able to sell what they have withdrawn The team can only access these withdrawn tokens after those 4 weeks

More details here Release schedulehttpsreserveorgprotocolrsr_release_schedulemaincontent

 Token  Protocol permissions minting and upgradability Is there a multisig What can it do Who are the signers
The total supply of RSR cannot be changed RSR did migrate from a V1 contract in the past and some RSR has not completed the migration yet The only minting that occurs is from migration which does not impact total supply

The contract is unupgradeable however it is pausable The pauser is set to the Reserve team multisighttpsgnosissafeioappeth0xA7b123D54BcEc14b4206dAb796982a6d5aaA6770home a 3of5 safe Pausing will only be done in situations where the token or platform is in danger Once the platform has reached steady state the team intends to release pausing to a burn address

150,"ARC  UIUX upgrade governance framework
The Aave protocol is a decentralized ecosystem of smartcontracts running on several EVM networks This ecosystem is permisionless and anyone with the required tech knowledge can freely use 100 of the Aave protocol features

That being said for a more accessible user experience the Aave companies created the Aave application 4 allowing the interaction with the Aave protocol without technical knowledge

To reinforce the decentralization of the application the Aave app is deployed on IFPS and considering Flux hosting to avoid centralization of hosting

also the Aave app is fully open source 1 and allows any developer to contribute to the improvement of the application for the benefit of the endusers

As recently we have witnessed multiple demands from thirdparties to be integrated in the aave App wallets onramps etc The presented framework intends to provide governance guidelines to standardize the process of integration into the Aave App

This framework is intended to provide standardization of UIUX integration of the Aave App

The proposed governance process for a UI integration is to have each entity do a governance thread open for at least 5 days

Then open a snapshot vote with a starting voting period of 24h in the future with at least 3 days open vote period considered valid with a 100k AAVE YAE vote quorum

the proposed options for the snapshot must be YAENAYABSTAIN

The Aave interface GitHub maintainers will then review the integration PR and provided they dont detect security issues will merge the PR

In the case of a security issue detected with the PR and not discussed before the snapshot vote the GitHub maintainers will open technical communication channels with the entity in an effort to allow the integration to be merged but will keep a veto right regardless of the governance process in the case the integration is considered harmful to Aave users security",33.8735818476499

status Proposal
author 3SE Holdings

Simple Summary
This ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmonys Horizon Bridge

This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony while still allowing repayment of debt liquidations withdrawals and changes to the interest rates Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts

Motivation
The Aave DAO Community through the governance forum has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users Protocol and DAO Harmony Horizon bridge exploit Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1

This proposed action is a first step that will protect usersIt will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop

Specification
If passed this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony In addition passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change disabling supply and borrow as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony",22.514970059880234

Technical Documentation Bridging Bitcoin To Avalanche A Technical Overview  by Michael Kaplan  Avalanche  Jun 2022  Medium
Support Documentation Avalanche Bridge  Avalanche Support

 Summary

This is a proposal to list BTCb as a collateral asset BTCb is the bridged version of Bitcoin from the Avalanche Bitcoin bridge

 Motivation

The Avalanche Bridge has become a cornerstone piece of infrastructure for the Avalanche community introducing an innovative security model that uses Intel SGX technology to usher in a new era of bridge technology The Bitcoin bridge will allow users to directly on and offramp from the Bitcoin network and enable Bitcoin users the chance to participate in DeFi It is a seamless easy and secure process

 Driving Factors

Secure the bridge must be audited and built with securityfirst technologies
CostEffective the cost of bridging assets should be low
Fast the transaction should take the least amount of time possible
Transparent users should be informed of the transfer status at every step of the process
Intuitive users new to crypto asset transfers can easily understand the steps to use the bridge
Specifications

 What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset
The author of the AIP is a representative of the Ava Labs team

 Provide a highlevel overview of the project and the token

Ava Labs is the servicing firm behind the Avalanche blockchain Avalanche is a network that is EVM compatible and can scale both vertically and horizontally through the subnet architecture and rollups Avalanche subnets can also support custom virtual machines and many programming languages

BTCb is the Avalanche bridged version of native Bitcoin and is noncustodial and permissionless allowing for one of the best and easiest onoff ramps to the Bitcoin network

 Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem Why would it be a good asset to borrow or use as collateral

BTCb is redeemable for the native version of BTC and might be the quickest easiest and safest way to get BTC onchain As we have seen in recent times CeFi carries its own risks and BTCb allows another avenue to get BTC onchain

BTCb is already integrated into multiple DeFi protocols within the Avalanche ecosystem such as Trader Joe Platypus Finance Pangolin Benqi and Paraswap

 Provide a brief history of the project and the different components DAO is it live products are they live How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced

Avalanches primary network consisting of its XChain PChain and CChain went live a little over a year ago with onchain protocols launching around that time and since then has not had any downtime CChain is an EVMcompatible contract chain and Avalanche subnets allow for horizontal scaling into a variety of virtual machines and languages

The Avalanche Ethereum Bridge is the most popular Ethereum bridge in terms of TVL and the network has become very popular for DeFi peaking at 2nd or 3rd in terms of TVL only behind Ethereum Avalanche initially struggled to gain liquidity and traction but Avalanche Rush Avalanches liquidity mining program that took place in the Autumn of 2021 attracted both Ethereum bluechip protocols and thousands of new users Avalanche also has native stablecoins ensuring some of the bridge risks are taken away

 How is the asset currently used

Currently there is about 28M worth of BTCb bridged to Avalanche CChain Some of the top protocols with BTCb integrated include 30M of liquidity deposited in Platypus Finance the Avalanche native stableswap 26M of liquidity within the Benqi lending protocol and 14M of liquidity for the AVAXBTCb pair within the AMM Trader Joe

 Emission schedule
No emission schedule

 Token  Protocol permissions minting and upgradability Is there a multisig What can it do Who are the signers

The bridge uses Intel SGX with a total of 8 wardens and the approval structure of 6 of 8 The wardens include Ankr Blockdaemon Chainstack Protofire Avascan Ava Labs Bware Labs and Halborn BTC bridging with Avalanche Bridge is not supported with Metamask or any other wallet other than the Avalanche Core Wallet This is because the Core Wallet Extension was custom built to support Bitcoin and the Avalanche Bridge and to handle the technical problems of linking Bitcoin and EVM chains within a wallet

The number of transactions 14440
The number of holders 408

 How It WorksTechnical Specifications

The Bridge can be broken down into two main parts the SGX application and a set of thirdparty indexers and verifiers called Wardens The Wardens are responsible for indexing the Avalanche and Bitcoin blockchains and submitting eligible transactions to the enclave for processing The SGX application requires 3 of 4 Wardens to submit the same transaction before generating the signed transaction to process the Bridge transfer on the other network For security reasons neither the enclave nor the Wardens are directly accessible to bridge users Instead theyll explicitly whitelist each others IP addresses for direct communication In addition all communication between the Enclave and Wardens will be encrypted and verified using TLS and include an HMAC signature For relaying information to the Bridge user base each warden hosts a JSON file containing the current bridge settings assets requirements and attestation report The front end is set to disable itself if theres any discrepancy within the critical information

 Proposed Technical Parameters

BTCb is proposed to start with a 70 percent max LTV a 75 percent liquidation threshold and a 65 percent liquidation penalty With the level of onchain liquidity and the ability to bridge from BTCb back to native BTC quickly and exchange on centralized exchanges for native Avalanche stablecoins these parameters are safe",39.743589743589745

 Simple Summary

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module SM protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested

 Abstract

The Safety Module is a 700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users Its a unique mechanism within DeFi that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market As a result not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection

As new markets hold more risk at launch they are initially excluded from the SM protection Today most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO they seem fit for SM protection

 Motivation

The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market As new markets hold additional risk these are not initially protected by the SM However once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months the risks are significantly lower Furthermore the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2

Overall these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market This implies that in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers

Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers lps on these markets By reducing the risk for lps it is expected to lead to further growth of the markets TVL overtime Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets lps are treated more equally across the markets

The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets In the case of Aave markets on other chains the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure and not failures caused by the chains themselves PolygonAvax With regards to the Aave Arc Market Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAOs stated risk parameters should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance

These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem In particular the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive Today most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon while just about 100k on Ethereum V2 These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections in a shorter time period

155," Summary   
  

Aave Companies is proposing to the DAO the introduction of GHO which was outlined in this initial proposal 

 
With community approval GHO can be launched on the Aave Protocol allowing users to mint GHO against their supplied collaterals   
  
GHO can be minted by users against a diversified set of cryptoassets Borrowers of GHO will continue earning interest on the underlying supplied collateral just as in all other borrow transactions on the Aave Protocol   
  

If approved the introduction of GHO will provide benefits for the community via the AaveDAO by sending 100 of interest payments on GHO borrows to the DAO  
  

If approved and implemented through an AIP GHO will be administered by Aave governance  
 
It will be up to the AaveDAO to decide whether they are willing to support Aave Companies for the costs and work associated with GHO 
 
 Community Feedback 
 
The community was very engaged with the GHO proposal providing incredibly helpful and informative feedback 
 

Some of the most notable feedback includes but is not limited to 
 

 Attention to potential pitfalls around DAOset interest rates 

 The importance of supply caps 

 The value that a peg stability module could bring 

 The necessity for properly vetting potential facilitators 

 

This snapshot if approved will assign the Ethereum V2 Market on the Aave Protocol as the first facilitator for GHO whilst also greenlighting the GHO proposal more generally allowing for audits to take place in the context of broad community approval It will be followed by a separate proposal that outlines a proposed strong starting state for GHO which incorporates and builds upon the aforementioned feedback while helping to ensure that GHO is community driven from the getgho 

  

 Snapshot  
  

This preliminary Snapshot vote serves to  
  
 Receive community approval for the pursuit of the GHO project  

 Whitelist the Aave V2 Ethereum Market as the first facilitator for GHO 
 Signal community approval to kick off discussions around starting parameters

Gauntlets risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify risk parameters including Loan To Value Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across 5 assets on Ethereum v3 Arbitrum v3 and Ethereum v2 For more details see the full forum post here httpsgovernanceaavecomtarfcgauntletriskparameterupdatesforethereumv3arbitrumv3ethereumv220230626138251


 Motivation

These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlets regular parameter recommendations and they seek to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk tradeoffs between specific assets

Gauntlets parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics insolvencies liquidations and borrow usage Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function Our agentbased simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis including but not limited to asset volatility asset correlation asset collateral usage DEX  CEX liquidity trading volume the expected market impact of trades and liquidator behavior Gauntlets simulations tease complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics As such the input metrics shown in the full forum posthttpsgovernanceaavecomtarfcgauntletriskparameterupdatesforethereumv3arbitrumv3ethereumv22023062613825 can help understand why some parameter recommendations have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for the recommendation The individual collateral pages on the Gauntlet Risk Dashboardhttpsriskgauntletnetworkprotocolsaave cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations

 Specification

Gauntlets simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at reasonable levels while optimizing for capital efficiency Our simulations show that we can improve the balance of risk and capital efficiency by making the parameter changes specified below

 Title ARFC OP Risk Parameters Update for Aave V3 Optimism Pool

 Author Marc Zeller marczeller  Aave Chan Initiative

 Date 20230825



 Summary

This ARFC proposes the activation of OP as a borrowable asset in the Aave V3 Optimism pool The aim is to adapt to the maturity of the L2 and attract more suppliers and borrowers thereby generating new revenue for the protocol

 Motivation

The Aave OP V3 market is one of the Aave V3 L2 deployments with OP being the native asset of the OP L2 At its inception the L2 was in its early stages leading to the onboarding of OP with conservative parameters due to nascent liquidity  infrastructure 

As the L2 has matured the ACI proposes less conservative parameters for the OP asset By removing the isolation mode for OP and allowing its borrowing we anticipate attracting more suppliers who can earn a yield on their OP deposits and new borrowers who can use OP to borrow additional assets This will also generate new revenue for the protocol 

While the proposed changes are less conservative they still maintain strict supply borrow caps and a conservative interest rate strategy This ensures that the DAO promotes growth and new opportunities while remaining riskaverse Based on the collected market data postimplementation the community will have the opportunity to revisit these parameters at a later stage

title ARFC Safety Module  Polygon  Avalanche Coverage Update
author TokenLogic
created 20230903



 Summary

This publication proposes updating the Safety Module SM coverage across the various iterations of Aave Protocol on Polygon and Avalanche networks

SM coverage is to be removed from Polygon v2 and Avalanche v2 deployments and extended to Avalanche v3

 Motivation

With the continued migration of users from v2 to v3 this publication seeks to further encourage users to migrate by removing the SM coverage for Aave v2 deployments on the Polygon and Avalanche networks

During 2023 the total market size on Avalanche and Polygon Aave v2 Protocol deployments has been trending lower At the time of writing the total market size of Aave v2 on Avalanche and Polygon is 362M and 1347M respectively For comparison the Aave v3 deployment on each network is 1998M and 2299M respectively 

By removing SM coverage for Avalanche and Polygon v2 deployments Aave DAO will no longer be providing coverage for the outdated iterations of Aave Protocol with exception of the Aave ARC deployment By removing the SM coverage users are further encouraged to migrate to v3

The Polygon Aave v3 deployment is already covered by the SM whilst the Avalanche v3 deployment is not cover by the SM This publication seeks to extend the SM coverage to include Avalanche v3 Therefore both v3 iterations are covered by the SM and v2 iterations are not covered on Polygon and Avalanche 

For reference at the time of writing the following Aave Protocol deployments are covered by the SM

 Specification

It is important to note based upon the current implementation of the SM an adhoc AIP is required to implement a Shortfall Event

The following Snapshot votes will be created to enable granular voting

 Extend SM Coverage to Avalanche v3
 Remove SM Coverage for Polygon v2
 Remove SM Coverage for Avalanche v2

Upon conclusion of the Snapshot vote if approved SM coverage will be removedextended to the respective market

There is no need for an AIP to implement this upgrade

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V3 Ethereum For more details see the full forum post herehttpsgovernanceaavecomtarfcupgradeaavev3ethpoolwethparameters15110


 Motivation

The current yields of stETH and reth have been observed at 33 and 307 respectively By adjusting the slope1 parameter of WETH we aim to

 Enhance Profitability in Leverage Loops The proposed adjustment will make leverage loops more profitable for users
 Align with stETH and reth Yields The adjustment aims to set the slope1 slightly below the current yields of stETH and reth ensuring Aave remains competitive

Increased utilization of ETH reserve is expected to partly compensate for the slight loss of protocol revenue due to lower interest rate equilibrium





 Specification

We propose two options for the weth slope1 parameters

 Option 1 Conservative Set slope1 to 32 10 bps below stETH yield but above rETH yield
 Option 2 Aggressive Set slope1 to 28 50 below stETH yield  23bps below rETH yield allowing both to be profitable

Additionally we propose reducing the optimalRatio to 80 to mitigate liquidity risks

title ARFC sDAI Onboarding on Aave V3 Gnosis Pool
author marczeller  Aavechan Initiative
date 09102023


 Summary

This ARFC proposes the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain Pool With the imminent deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain and the recent deployment of sDAI we believe this integration will further enhance the utility and liquidity of the Aave ecosystem on Gnosischain

 Motivation

 Aave V3 Gnosischain Deployment The deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain is on the horizon As outlined in the Gnosischain deployment ARFChttpsgovernanceaavecomtarfcaavev3deploymentongnosischain14695 sDAI was identified as a prime collateral candidate for Aave However at the time of the proposals creation sDAI had not been deployed
  
 Rapid Growth of sDAI Since its deployment sDAI has shown significant traction attracting 46M in just a few days This demonstrates the communitys trust and the potential of sDAI as a collateral asset in the Aave ecosystem
  
 Technical  Timeframe Considerations We propose the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain deployment either as part of the initial deployment or through a subsequent onboarding AIP depending on whats most optimal from both a technical and timeframe perspective

 Specification

 Asset sDAI
 Contract Address 0xaf204776c7245bF4147c2612BF6e5972Ee483701

A Price sync adapter oracle considering both wxDAI value and sDAI exchange rate will be implemented as a Price feed for this asset

 Risk Parameters

title ARFC Treasury Management  Add to rETH Holding
author TokenLogic  MatthewGraham  DefiJesus  ACI  MarcZeller 
created 20231014



 Summary

This publication proposes acquiring rETH with ETH held in the DAOs Ethereum Treasury

 Abstract

This publication proposes converting a portion of the wETH awETH and wEthWETH held in the Treasury to rETH

A balance of 100 aEthWETH will remain in the Treasury to facilitate on going DAO expenses such as the Quarterly Gas Rebatehttpsgovernanceaavecomtarfcquarterlygasrebatedistributionaugust202314680 and any other future expense that arise

 Motivation

At the time of writing the Aave DAO has the following assets in the Ethereum Treasury

AssetQty Value 
      
wETH 1456 2254332
awETH5303982082960
aEthWETH51045  78996205

The following assets are available to be claimed from the Paraswap Legacy Fees and Fee Claimer contract

AssetQty Value 
      
wETH 453 701199
wETH 108 1671732

This publication proposes converting all wETH awETH and all but 100 aEthWETH to rETH The 100 aEthWETH is to remain to support on going DAO funding 

The table below shows the yield differential between the various assets

AssetYield  
     
wETH 000
awETH126
aEthWETH197 
rETH307

Based upon current market conditions the additional yield generated by converting the assets as outlined to rETH is 2326650 

Upon implementation of this ARFChttpsgovernanceaavecomtarfcupgradeaavev3ethpoolwethparameters15110 the additional yield generated is 65442 for the conservative and 278286 for the aggressive approach due to the reduction in deposit rates of approximately 103 bps and 335bps respectively This does not take into consideration how the market will then adjust after the ETH v3 interst rate parameters are changed 

 Specification

The following is to be performed

 Deposit all wETH into aEthWETH Aave V3 wETH
 Withdraw all awETH Aave V2 wETH into ETH
 Withdraw all but 100 aEthWETH Aave V3 wETH into ETH
 Deposit ETH into RocketPools rETH
 Transfer rETH into collector

Title ARFC BGD Security budget request  December 2023

Author BGD Labs bgdlabs

Date 2023128



 Summary
Request for a budget of 121200 for 2 security review procedures on Aave together with a refund of 30000 to BGD for the Aave Governance v3 extra voting tokens auditA


Amounting a grand total of 151200


 Motivation
Part of our scope Aave  BGD Phase IIhttpsgovernanceaavecomtaaveboredghostsdevelopingphase214484scope6 is the planning engagement and coordination with security partners of the DAO

During the previous year and a half Aave was in a pretty intensive delivery phase Aave v3 improvements GHO Aave Governance v3 aDI and we thought it was appropriate to have continuous engagement with 2 security firms like Certora and SigmaPrime

Even if this worked well and we still think that Certora should stay with a continuous engagementhttpsgovernanceaavecomtarfccontinuoussecurityproposalaavecertora157324 we also think that there is room for optimisation and it is a good idea to do more adhoc requests for the security budget depending on the needs

This ARFC is an initial request for budget required in the short term on item part of our development services scope together with another more general we consider pretty important

 Specification
This request has 3 components which we want to explain to the community



1 Compensation for Mixbytes review of Governance v3 tokens

During the activation of Aave Governance v3 on October 17th we detected a problem with the voting assets which required the cancellation of the proposal the development of a fix and reapply security procedures

Given that it was already audited code we also decided to do an extra security review by another security firm Mixbytes

For the sake of speed and reducing bureaucratic blockers BGD paid for the cost of said security review of 30000 and now we will include on this proposal a refund request for that amount



2 Compensation for security review on a feature of Aave 31

Also part of our Phase 2 scope is to do a series of improvements to Aave v3 in order to reach a 31 version from the current 302

Generally we are confident with Certora reviewing all the planned items until now but there is one exception an specific feature to which we thought an extra review was required and we engaged Emanuele Ricci StErMi a toplevel security researcher with knowledge of Aave to do it
We will be publishing soon everything to be included into v31

Same as with Mixbytes BGD has paid the cost of said security review of 12000 and now we include the refund request on this proposal



3 Engagement with Spearbit for Aave v3 adhoc review

Aave v2v3 is a production system with billions of dollars in size and one of the most evaluated protocols securitywise
However security is a continuous process and always worth it to improve whenever it feels necessary

During the last 12 months we have noticed different security exploits in the space following similar patterns None of them affected Aave but apart from our continuous analysis of the system securitywise we think it is necessary to do an extra round of review in critical parts of Aave for additional assurance

We have coordinated an engagement for this review scope with Spearbit one of the leading security firms in the space that will involve 3 of their top researchers checking indepth different components that we identify as critical on Aave

This engagement is scheduled to start in the second part of December and different from the others the payment requested in the proposal will be direct to Spearbit for an amount of 109200



From a technical perspective
 The proposal will send 42000 to BGD as compensation for the expenses of part 1 and 2
 109200 will be sent to a Spearbit wallet to compensate for the services to be provided on part 3

The final addresses and stablecoins of the treasury to use will be included in the AIP stage previous coordination about the last with contributors to the financial area of the Aave DAO",30.35340746449412

Title ARFC  Retroactive bug bounties proposal preImmunefi

Author BGD Labs bgdlabs

Date 20240109



 Summary

Request for bounties pending from before the setup of the Aave  Immunefi official bug bounty program amounting a grand total of 86500

The objective of this ARFC is to preauthorise such payments to be processed via an onchain AIP

 Motivation

Before the setup of the Aave  Immunefi bug bounty program on September 25th 2023httpsgovernancev2aavecomgovernanceproposal325 security reports by white hats where evaluated in an adhoc basis proposing bountiesrewards following an approach like on this proposalhttpsgovernanceaavecomtbgdbugbountiesproposal13077 That was not optimal as there was no formal scope defined or strict ranges of bounties depending on severity and impact

Currently every report is being processed via Immunefi and the rules of the Aave program however there were other reports submitted via other channel before that usually securityaavecom As these reports should be evaluated at time of submission for fairness and outside of the Immunefi scope defined afterwards we think it is a good idea to reward them separately and retroactively outside the program

 Specification

 Reports

First of all we want to clarify certain aspects for the community

 The proposed rewards and evaluation metrics follow the ones we did adhoc in the past HEREhttpsgovernanceaavecomtbgdbugbountiesproposal13077clarificationonevaluation2 as we dont think it is fair for the whitehats to apply the rewards ranges on the current Immunefi program and outofscope rules as they were defined afterwards
 In one of the cases we recommended the white hat to submit the report via Immunefi in order to have access to the mediation procedure of the platform As this mediation process was finally requested by the white hat Immunefi charges the corresponding fee of 10 of the amount which we think is legitimate
 At the moment we are not disclosing the full details of some of the reports because even if none of them create any risk for Aave now one has dependencies with another report not disclosed yet and the other could increase risk to nonAave entities


 1 Inconsistent validation on  Aave v2v3

When calling borrow with stable rate mode on Aave v2 and v3 one of the validations is that not more than a percentage of the total available liquidity can be borrowed at once

However swapBorrowRateMode doesnt validate the same which is unexpected and could lead to more stable rate borrowings than intended

It is important to highlight that this is not possible at the moment with minting of stable rate disabled


Severity  Low

The issue didnt create any immediate problem in the protocol but overexposure to stable rate mode is not expected

Likelihood  Certain

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3 on those assets with stable rate enabled

Proposed bounty 10000 USD



 2 Inconsistent HF Health Factor behaviour swap borrow rate mode

When swapping borrow rate mode the HF of an user is not validated as debt should remain the same However under edge scenarios the HF of an user could slightly change by 1 unit of lowest assets decimals


Severity  No impact

This is not a bug or creates any exploit scenario but it is unexpected behaviour

Likelihood  Certain

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3 on those assets with stable rate enabled

Proposed bounty 5000 USD



 3 Price manipulation of asset listed on Aave

By executing a complex strategy involving compromising the assets trusted infrastructure it could be possible to inflate the price of one of the assets listed on Aave v2

Even if this belongs more to the centralisation risk of the asset and we dont consider a bug of the protocol it was taken into account for offboarding consideration of the asset by risk providers of Aave and we believe it is fair to reward retroactively

As this risk still exist on the asset itself and more protocols could be using it even if we dont really see any immediate risk we will not be disclosing at the moment details of it until the team applies extra measures


Severity  Critical

Being a price manipulation the impact on the protocol would hypotetically be important

Likelihood Not likely

The attack involves compromising assets infrastructure which would directly disqualify on the current Aave  Immunefi program together with extra techniques so we consider it theoretically possible but highly improbable

Proposed bounty 65000 USD Additionally 6500 USD as Immunefi fee

 Next steps

If this ARFC is positive afterwards we will proceed with an onchain governance proposal releasing the funds to the corresponding addresses",25.284302263789982

Title ARFC Chaos Labs  Update WETH IR on V3 Arbitrum and Optimism  02162024 
Author Chaos Labs
Date 20240216



 Simple Summary

Decrease slope1 on Arbitrum and Optimism from 33 to 3

 Motivation

Over the last eight months we have observed a dropoff in WETH interest rates on Ethereum and thus relative demand for ETH borrowing

 
imageipfsbafkreic3lclpvo7ac5253ucpeejalt42j6h3cdjnrd6vaefdlr62nht23e
    
Time series of WETH borrow APY on Ethereum Arbitrum and Optimism in addition to stETH APY


Note that the red dotted line indicates the point when the base_fee decreased from 1 to 0 on Arbitrum and Optimism This phenomenon can be explained by the dropoff in ETH staking yield as we can deduce through the relatively strong correlation between WETH borrow APY and stETH staking APY on Ethereum due to profitable looping strategies Additionally given Aave prices stETHETH 11 with the underlying exchange rate minimal liquidation risk exists in potential wstETH market price movements

Correlation Between stETH APY and WETH APY

Crosscorrelation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag

Computing the crosscorrelation between the three markets we notice an approximately 1week lag when this hits the maximum value implying the speed at which the borrow rates are maximally reflected in the staking APY

This is statistically significant as we can see below where 8590 of all WETH debt is backed by ETH LSTs on the respective chain

Interestingly enough one might think that as stETH yields decrease looping strategies would become less profitable However upon analyzing the difference between the stETH APY and WETH borrow APY stETH APY  WETH APY alongside the stETH APY itself at a given time t a negative correlation emerges with the peak occurring at a 2week lag Essentially this means that the rate of decrease in borrow APY over time outpaces that of the stETH APY Thus we can conclude that when stETH APYs are high borrowers attempt to extract as much revenue as possible leading to convergence at lower yields On the contrary when stETH APYs are low borrowers and ETH borrow APYs tend to be less aggressive with looping perhaps due to theoretical scaling in the interest rate requiring smaller growth to become unprofitable leading to the effective yield scaling higher than instances when stETH APYs are high This in turn leads to less efficient markets and larger spreads when ETH staking yields are low

WETH Utilization Rates

WETH Utilization rate time series

Based on the observed trend its evident that Arbitrum and Optimism could benefit from a reduction in slope1 to enhance utilization rates and consequently increase revenues While the decrease in base_rate on both chains did positively impact utilization it remains suboptimal Thus we simply take the P95 of the stETH APY differential vs WETH borrow APY since the base_rate decrease which returned 06 to derive the decrease in slope1 Considering the Uoptimal rate is projected to be below the current stETH APY with a 06 variance any prolonged convergence above Uoptimal could lead to interest rate volatility In such a scenario it would be prudent to revert slope1 However given the current trend and staking APY this adjustment would likely result in higher utilization rates and greater profits for the Aave DAO

Assuming convergence at todays WETH interest rates

   Arbitrum  Optimism 
      
 Old Utilization Rate  6869  65 
 New Utilization Rate  765  72 
 Projected Revenue Increase  1362 ETH 385k year  4 ETH 113k year 

We note that adjusting WETH slope1 on other nonEthereum chains with this intuition is seen as irrelevant as either the market itself portrays too small a sample size with minimal relative demand for ETH LSTs as collateral there does not exist ETH LSTs on the chain or ETH LST supply caps have been at max capacity for months

Title ARFC Stablecoin Harmonization and Asset Parameters Optimization 
Author ACI Aave Chan Initiative
Date 20240103


 Simple Summary

This ARFC proposes focusing stablecoin collateral usage on USDT and USDC while setting LTV to zero for lesstrafficked stablecoins and longtail assets The objective is to minimize risk for the protocol optimize revenue generation and align with market demand trends

 Motivation

Aaves revenue primarily comes from wETH borrowing and stablecoins borrowing Years of User behavior data in DeFi indicates a low demand for fluctuating assets as collateral except in usecasespecific scenarios LSTLRT loops for Weth RPL borrow to deploy mini pools Based on ChaosLabs  datahttpscommunitychaoslabsxyzaaveriskmarketsEthereumlistedassets only 24 37 and 58 of supplied DAI USDT and USDC on Ethereum are being utilized as collateral We can also note that market demand for alternative stablecoins is less sensitive to borrow rates compared to bluechip stablecoins like USDT and USDC


The DAO governance has been lenient in onboarding some collaterals such as KNC which currently attracts nearly zero traction currently used to generate 079 of borrow volume and generates minimal revenue Additionally the asymmetric risk presented by stablecoins such as during the CRV event collateral was USDC with very high LT and low LB highlights the need for optimization considering Riskreward

 Specification

 Proposed Adjustments

The ACI proposes the following strategy shift

1 Focus on USDT and USDC as primary stablecoin collaterals
2 Set LTV to zero for alternative stablecoins and long tail assets
3 Enable a 3week LT reduction for these stablecoins assets providing ample time for users to react and keep them as passive yield sources or borrowable assets that represent 99 of current user demand and most of protocol revenue
4 Propose the following adjusted standardized ReserveFactor categories for Aave assets

 Collateral Type  Reserve Factor  
    
 wETH  15 
 USDCUSDT  10 
 Alternative stablecoins  long tail assets  20 
 DAI  25 

5 Fade out as collateral the following stablecoins 

 FRAX
 LUSD
 EURS
 agEUR
 JEUR
 MAI

6 freeze if not already then slowly offboard the following alternative stablecoins and longtail assets that failed to gain traction by gradually increasing RF to 999 decreasing LT by 3 per week then applying incremental interestRateStrategies incentivizing users to switch to others collaterals or borrowed asset as the DAO implemented for BUSD and TUSD on Aave V2

 Collateral Type           Network

title ARFC Aave Liquidity Committee Funding
author karpatkey_TokenLogic
created 20240229



 Summary

This publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee with 500k GHO to continue supporting GHOs liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next 3 months

 Motivation

Since its initial funding in October 2023httpsgovernancev2aavecomgovernanceproposal343 the Aave Liquidity Committee previously GLC has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes by deploying and incentivising liquidity pools
 
As a result of these efforts

 Deeper onchain liquidity
 Lower slippage especially for GHO to USDC swaps

In combination with other efforts like stkGHO ALCs initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHOs peg recovery

Throughout the period the ALC leveraged on both Uniswap v3 and more frequently Maverick to tailor liquidity distribution at specific price ranges which helped absorb GHO downward market volatility A list of active Boosted Positions can be found herehttpsappmavxyzboostedpositionschain1

While some pools are incentivised by voting with preexisting DAO holdings eg vlAURA others like Mavericks concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses It is worth noting the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick We expect Maverick and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3 to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience

Concentrated GHO liquidity was recently introduced in BalancerhttpstwittercomGyroStablestatus1757365157917815001 with the creation of several ECLP pools These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAOs vlAURA holding When there is excess vlAURA votes these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70 APR nominated in USDC 

The following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHOs ecosystem highlights

 GHOUSDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume 
     02 bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period
     01 bin width pool is starting to replace the 02 bin width pool trading volume This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 01 bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility 
  GHOUSDCUSDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP
      Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by other protocolshttpstwittercomMatthew_Graham_status1762076544241955070 and leveraged farming is introduced
 Gyrsocope ECLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks
      As the peg improves one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg

The next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas

 100100 peg with USD 
 Reducing price volatility
 Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations
 Grow non stablecoinpaired liquidity pools
 Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases

These efforts will need to scale to match GHOs expected growth profile The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future as well as participation in the launch of various projects like Ethenahttpsappethenafiliquidity and fx Protocols launchhttpsxcomprotocol_fxstatus1762822716854354015s20 

Though there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates price volatility and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations we believe a highlevel budget will look like the following

 Objective  Category  Budget   
        
 Liquidity  Peg Resilience  360k GHO 
 DeFi Integrations   Create Utility    140k GHO 
Total  500k GHO

It is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum

 Performance Indicators

The below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking

 Description Optimal Value
      
 TVL DEX Liquidity Pools  50M 
 TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools   15M excl stkGHO  
 DEX Liquidity Composition   50 GHO  33 for 3pools  
 Swap Price Impact 5M Swap   010  GHO to USDC
 Annualised Peg Volatility   500  
 Price level for  90 time    0995 using Redstone Medium PricehttpsappredstonefinanceapptokenGHO  

Please note each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next 3 months on the assumption the Borrow Cap is continually increased beyond the current 35M Bucket Size Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve

The stkGHO implementationhttpsappaavecomstaking USDe integrationhttpsappethenafiliquidity and coordinated efforts to attract users to acquire GHO are all great examples of how growth initiatives drive GHO utility adoption and have a positive impact the spot price 

Each of the above metrics plus more will be shown on the TokenLogic analytics dashboard

Date 20240513
Author Marc Zeller  Aave Chan Initiative ACI


 Summary

Proposing the renewal of the Orbit program for recognized delegates compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement of Gas costs associated with their governance activity

 Motivation

Orbit recognizes the added value of the Delegates in the decentralization  diversity of the Aave DAO This compensation allows them to focus on aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter

With the transition to Governance V3 a significant feature introduced is gasless voting via Gelato integration on the DAOrun governance apphttpsvoteonaavecom making it easier for delegates to participate without the burden of gas costs This innovation prompts the proposal to discontinue the general gas rebate program However recognizing the continued necessity for proposal creation and payload deployment activities we propose maintaining targeted gas rebates for these specific actions

 Specification

 Period Coverage Blocks 19162697 5th Feb 2024 to Block 19860031 May 13th 2024
 Eligible Platforms
	 EzR3al
	 Stable Labs
	 Saucy Block

Title ARFC Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum
Date 20240513
Author Aave Chan Initiative ACI


 Summary

The proposal aims to onboard Threshold Networks tBTC to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum tBTC is backed onetoone with Bitcoin

 MotivationBackground

tBTC is Thresholds decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereums Decentralized Finance DeFi applications Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet

Having recently acquired a Chainlink oracle tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC ie bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave

tBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO and extensively utilizes the Threshold Networks threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network on which many other decentralized applications are being built

Threshold Network DAO was born out of the first onchain merger between two decentralized protocols Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022 The DAO has successfully operated since that time and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability

 Benefits for Aave

 Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack
 A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC
 Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD into the Aave offering
 Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation boosting Aave protocol use fees and TVL
 Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitriums LTIPP

 TEMP CHECK Onboard CDCETH to Aave V3 on Ethereum
 Author Jlok  ACI
  Date 20240715


 Summary

This proposal is to explore community interest in adding Cryptocomhttpcryptocom Staked ETH CDCETH to Aave V3 on the Ethereum mainnet CDCETH is an ERC20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the Cryptocomhttpcryptocom platform

 Motivation

Cryptocomhttpcryptocom was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet As of June 2024 Cryptocom httpcryptocom has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance security and privacy

Cryptocomhttpcryptocom launched its onchain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform 

To enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH Cryptocomhttpcryptocom introduced a Liquid Staking Token LST  Cryptocomhttpcryptocom Staked ETH CDCETH in November 2023 and reached 100M TVL Defillama page here

Currently CDCETHs onchain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETHETH pair on Curve here and Uniswap here with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues 

Other liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the Cryptocomhttpcryptocom Exchange platform with support from multiple market makers 

The liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the Cryptocomhttpcryptocom platform

Integrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the Cryptocomhttpcryptocom platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded

Confidential bannerslistings on the Cryptocomhttpcryptocom noncustodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the noncustodial wallet
Onboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and Cryptocomhttpcryptocom users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETHs utility as a LST resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH  Aave adoption  increased revenues for both parties

 Proof of Liquidity POL and Deposit Commitments

 Cryptocomhttpcryptocom is committed to providing initial supplyside liquidity of up to 5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of 100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start

Integration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with Cryptocomhttpcryptocoms noncustodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform

Set Borrow cap to 46 Million


Proposal remove the borrow cap on the cCOMP market

On last Wednesdays Community Call I tried and failed to record the callnext time we discussed removing the cCOMP borrow cap of 100k COMP The borrow cap was originally put into place to prohibit someone from using the market to borrow COMP create a governance proposal vote and return the capital in seconds After the upgrade to Governor Bravo and the installation of a review period the governance process is significantly more costprohibitive for a borrower to obtain the necessary votes to meet the proposal threshold As well the review period gives users 48hours to position their COMP holding for a vote unlike Governor Alpha which used an instantaneous voting system If a malicious user were to borrow the required COMP to meet the proposal threshold the community would have sufficient time to defeat their proposal

Removing the borrow cap will help the COMP market develop Trading firms onchain and offchain utilize money markets like Compound and Aave in their systems to borrow assets and particularly ones that are not abundant in supply in traditional borrowlend services like BlockFi Genesis Nexo and Celsius It is helpful for everyone if spot and futures markets are efficient

Next Steps Changing the borrow cap does not require a traditional governance proposal since caps are controlled by the community multisig The multisig holders follow the direction of the community Below is a 7day poll for removing the borrow cap on the cCOMP market If you vote YES you think the borrow cap should be removed If you vote NO you do not think the borrow cap should be removed If the poll revolves to YES after the 7day period the multisig holders will remove the borrow cap",27.52114723764209
