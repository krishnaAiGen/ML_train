## Introduction
For those who don’t know, the Ballers are a group of long term community contributors to Balancer Protocol. This proposal will feature messages from the Ballers about their activities to give the community some context around analyzing the value of this proposal. Under the current framework the Baller program is being funded in three month increments. Our current round of funding is set to expire November 1st, 2021. Over the last few months, the program has grown significantly in member count and scope. Commensurate with this growth is an increase in the funding cost. Currently the Ballers operate with no hierarchy - it is up to each Baller to determine their level of “Ballery” (full or half or none) and their level of engagement.

I have taken the role of distributing the Ballery so I check in with each Baller every month to see what they’re up to and if they have any feedback/concerns. We’ve also adopted bi-weekly Baller Round Table meetings to better coordinate amongst ourselves. I asked each Baller to write up a bit about what they’ve been doing recently so the community has some context to frame the discussion around this proposal - note this was up to each Baller to determine if they wanted to write anything or not.

You can see the list of currently active Ballers [here](https://www.notion.so/63091677228841de9fa909139e60362f?v=a7852fc9da684a5a834934e5215edd6d). This is updated to be reflective of the next three months.

Notable changes compared to the previous three months: Tongnk is going from half Ballery to none as he’s primarily focused on grants where he’s directly compensated. Andrea, Mike B, and Xeonus are moving from half to full as the scale of their contributions have increased.

## Baller Active Roles & Contributions

Please see the forum post referenced at the top of this proposal. This section was too large to fit in the snapshot vote.

## Conclusion & Specification
With a proposed roster of thirteen active Ballers (five full, eight half) at the current rate of 500 BAL per month for full and 250 BAL per month for half with 60% fully unlocked after two years (1 year cliff, 1 year linear vesting) and 40% liquid immediately, the total cost of funding for the next three months is as follows.

1,800 BAL per month in liquid payments * 3 = 5,400 BAL
2,700 BAL per month in vested payments * 3 = 8,100 BAL

In addition, I request 300 BAL as a spending fund to reward notable community contributions and fund any small projects the Ballers might need funding for.

#### Total: 13,800 BAL

If approved, the ecosystem fund will distribute this amount to a wallet I control. The Ballers desire to re-use existing vesting contracts, so the vested amounts for each Baller would be fully released in October 2023. I will work with Mike McDonald to make a contract for any Baller who does not have an existing vesting contract with a fully vested date that matches the existing ones.",bullish

https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/645

**Summary:**
The [ether.fi](https://www.ether.fi/) team proposes a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a weETH-WETH pool on Ethereum mainnet, with a 10% emissions cap.

**References/Useful links:**

    • Website - https://www.ether.fi/
    • Documentation - https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/ether.fi-whitepaper
    • Github Page - https://github.com/etherfi-protocol
    • Discord - https://discord.com/invite/zqGzcuQWvD
    • Twitter - https://twitter.com/ether_fi

**Protocol Description:**

Ether.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.

ETH staked through the ether.fi protocol liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Currently when users wish to restake their LST’s they lock their tokens, which breaks composability in DeFi. Staking with eETH on [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols. No other liquid staking protocol has this capability.

The eETH contract has been live since June 2023 and has approx. 10,000 ETH held within in - this ETH was accumulated before eETH was officially launched and available for end users to hold directly. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.

Through these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum's staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.

**Motivation:**

Ether.fi is looking to seed a weETH/wETH pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for eETH. Incentivising a Balancer pool could significantly boost the liquidity of the LRT. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the DeFi ecosystem. To ensure success, ether.fi is committed to enhancing the value of the veBAL ecosystem by promoting pool liquidity through Hidden Hand voting incentives

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:**  - Currently, the protocol utilises a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed ether.fi executives. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token in approx. 3-6 months.

2. **Oracles:** - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the ether.fi team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee.

3. **Audits:** - Audit reports for the ether.fi protocol are found on the GitBook page - https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits. The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance. 

4. **Centralization vectors:** - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team at Ether.fi, however this will be upgraded with the implementation of the ether.fi DAO and governance.

5. **Market History:** eETH is a brand new Liquid restaking token, therefore there is not much in the way of market history as Balancer will serve as the first pool to support wrapped eETH. 
weETH/wETH pool on Balancer: [0xb9dEbDDF1d894c79D2B2d09f819FF9B856FCa552](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9debddf1d894c79d2b2d09f819ff9b856fca552)

6. **Value:** - The weETH/wETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token. The pairing of eETH with wETH allows for a more seamless trading experience within the Ethereum ecosystem, which could attract more users and, in turn, generate more fees for the platform.

**Specification**:

### Goal of the vote
Establish policies and guidelines on Temperature Check Votes held on snapshot for 0x DAO. **This is a second iteration after a first vote on this matter, removing one of the requirements (minimum addresses).**

### Scope
The purpose of snapshot proposals is to gauge community sentiment on serious topics under consideration for onchain governance votes that impact 0x protocol.

Temperature checks are non-binding. For example, while a temperature check might indicate community support to introduce a change in smart contracts, a team will have to submit a complete ZEIP vote to come into effect. The same applies to Treasury proposals, which always require an onchain-binding vote.

The domain upon which the community of ZRX holders has decision-making power includes:

- 0x protocol (smart contracts and their deployments)
- [0x Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0bb1810061c2f5b2088054ee184e6c79e1591101)
- [ZRX Portal UI](https://0x.org/zrx)
- ZRX token

**Posts regarding airdrops and frontend integrators (such as Matcha) do not meet these criteria and will be deleted.**

### Process and requirements
- Temperature checks can be initiated by any ZRX holder or delegate with a voting power of **at least 10k (ten thousand) ZRX**.
- A link to an existing discussion on gov.0x.org must be provided in the description of the vote.
- The vote is considered valid once it reaches a **quorum of 1M (one million) ZRX** ~~with at least 50 addresses voting~~. The quorum is intended to be set on the winning option (not on the sum of votes on all options).
- A temperature check vote must last **at least 5 days**. In case of tighter deadlines, a 3 days (72 hours) duration could be accepted.
Any proposal that does not meet the criteria will be either ignored or deleted from the space.

5,"## Rationale

This VIP proposes a new set of parameters for VAI based on this discussion 1.

## Summary

Increase the steepness of the interest rate curve of VAI to incentivize VAI close to $1.

## Motivation

- Harden the peg by making it expensive to borrow VAI when the VAI price is low.
- Provide a better rate for borrowers when VAI is at $1.

## Specification

Modification of this VIP:
- baseRate: 3% (from 4%)
- floatRate: 4000% (from 225%)

We provide an exemple of the implication of the changes in the forum post.

This VIP doesn’t enable VAI borrowings, this will be enabled in a following VIP contingent to having a significant healthy buffer in the VAI USDT PSM.

## Risk Analysis

- Reduction of earnings if VAI stays at $1
- Increasing the VAI borrow rate might reduce VAI borrowings and TVL

**Title:** [ARFC] Chaos Labs - Update WETH IR on V3 Arbitrum and Optimism - 02.16.2024 
**Author:** Chaos Labs
**Date:** 2024-02-16

---

### Simple Summary

Decrease slope1 on Arbitrum and Optimism from 3.3% to 3%.

### Motivation

Over the last eight months, we have observed a drop-off in WETH interest rates on Ethereum and, thus, relative demand for ETH borrowing.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreic3lclpvo7ac5253ucpeejalt42j6h3cdjnrd6vaefdlr62nht23e)
    
*Time series of WETH borrow APY on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism, in addition to stETH APY.*


Note that the red dotted line indicates the point when the base_fee decreased from 1% to 0% on Arbitrum and Optimism. This phenomenon can be explained by the drop-off in ETH staking yield, as we can deduce through the relatively strong correlation between WETH borrow APY and stETH staking APY on Ethereum due to profitable looping strategies. Additionally, given Aave prices stETH:ETH 1:1 with the underlying exchange rate, minimal liquidation risk exists in potential wstETH market price movements.

**Correlation Between stETH APY and WETH APY**

![image](ipfs://bafkreihrjropidawamiki4v4bchp6lgb4fwp2rhvodamveeec4vcqwpgoy)
    
*Cross-correlation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*

Computing the cross-correlation between the three markets, we notice an approximately 1-week lag when this hits the maximum value, implying the speed at which the borrow rates are maximally reflected in the staking APY.

This is statistically significant, as we can see below, where 85%-90% of all WETH debt is backed by ETH LSTs on the respective chain.

### stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY

Interestingly enough, one might think that as stETH yields decrease, looping strategies would become less profitable. However, upon analyzing the difference between the stETH APY and WETH borrow APY (stETH APY - WETH APY) alongside the stETH APY itself at a given time t, a negative correlation emerges, with the peak occurring at a 2-week lag. Essentially, this means that the rate of decrease in borrow APY over time outpaces that of the stETH APY. Thus, we can conclude that when stETH APYs are high, borrowers attempt to extract as much revenue as possible, leading to convergence at lower yields. On the contrary, when stETH APYs are low, borrowers and ETH borrow APYs tend to be less aggressive with looping, perhaps due to theoretical scaling in the interest rate requiring smaller growth to become unprofitable, leading to the effective yield scaling higher than instances when stETH APYs are high. This in turn leads to less efficient markets and larger spreads when ETH staking yields are low.

**stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY**

*Time series of stETH APY - WETH APY. stETH APY plotted on secondary axis.*

*Cross-correlation between (stETH - WETH borrow APY) and stETH APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*

**WETH Utilization Rates**

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreihjpcivhoywbhley2ysf4zaaa7nqmkqtsx7f3rt33dvphemir6w4u)
    
*WETH Utilization rate time series.*

Based on the observed trend, it's evident that Arbitrum and Optimism could benefit from a reduction in slope1 to enhance utilization rates and consequently increase revenues. While the decrease in base_rate on both chains did positively impact utilization, it remains suboptimal. Thus, we simply take the P95 of the stETH APY differential vs WETH borrow APY since the base_rate decrease, which returned 0.6%, to derive the decrease in slope1. Considering the Uoptimal rate is projected to be below the current stETH APY with a 0.6% variance, any prolonged convergence above Uoptimal could lead to interest rate volatility. In such a scenario, it would be prudent to revert slope1. However, given the current trend and staking APY, this adjustment would likely result in higher utilization rates and greater profits for the Aave DAO.

Assuming convergence at today’s WETH interest rates:

|  | Arbitrum | Optimism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Old Utilization Rate | 68.69% | 65% |
| New Utilization Rate | 76.5% | 72% |
| Projected Revenue Increase | 13.62 ETH $38.5k year | 4 ETH $11.3k year |

We note that adjusting WETH slope1 on other non-Ethereum chains with this intuition is seen as irrelevant, as either the market itself portrays too small a sample size with minimal relative demand for ETH LSTs as collateral, there does not exist ETH LSTs on the chain or ETH LST supply caps have been at max capacity for months.

###  Specification

| Chain | Asset |Parameter | Currebt |Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- | ---| ---|
| Arbitrum | WETH |Slope1| 3.3% | 3% |
| Optimism | WETH|Slope1|3.3% | 3% |

## Next Steps

1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.
2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.

On April 18th the funding of the Balancer DAO for Q2 was ratified [[1](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xe05bc1a898797cd8f78f86bed25bac84efade2df1a959daee09f8dd7c69d3b36)]. As part of the proposal 21,250 BAL and $127,500 USDC was requested for contributor compensation. With the recent market downturn the ops multisig does not have sufficient BAL to pay the expected June Balaries (See here how discounted veBAL compensation is calculated [[2](https://balancergrants.notion.site/Compensation-cb303e0241d94d96bed110929947029d)] ). The proposal is to:

* ops subDAO Multisig [[3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325#tokentxns)] swaps its remaining USDC (expected to be 76892 USDC) after USDC Balaries for June with the treasury for the additional BAL required to pay out June Balaries in BAL (expected to be 22805 BAL ). This amount of BAL was calculated based on a BAL price of $3,66 on June 18th. After June has commenced the remaining BAL in the ops subDAO multisig will be sent back to treasury.

## Motivation

Preservation of USDC available for the Balancer DAO can be the prudent choice in the current market conditions. Therefore a swap of BAL (from the DAO treasury) <> USDC (from the ops subDAO Multisig ) with the Balancer DAO treasury would retain USDC on the DAO’s balance sheet and manage to pay the Balaries for June for people who are looking to get their Balary as discounted $veBAL.

## Risks (if applicable)

* While the ops subDAO made best efforts to poll contributors for their expected Balary, the official determination will happen at the end of the month via our monthly health-check.
* BAL price falls below 3,66 by the end of the month and a new proposal needs to be voted on to request the additional $BAL due to the decreased price of $BAL.

## Specification

* ops subDAO ( 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325 ) sends 76892 USDC to Balancer DAO treasury.
* Balancer DAO treasury ( 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f ) sends 22805 BAL to the ops subDAO multisig.",bullish
10,"Summary 

The proposal to list weETH assets on Venus Protocol offers significant benefits to the Venus community, including the opportunity to add Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT) from ether.fi on ETH Mainnet. 

Users can stake their ETH, earn rewards, and enjoy additional benefits through restaking on EigenLayer. With approximately $2.7B in TVL already deposited into the ether.fi protocol, the addition of weETH to Venus can enhance asset diversity and liquidity on the platform.

By integrating weETH, Venus allows users to earn ether.fi
and EigenLayer points for future incentives, along with lending APY on their holdings. 

The proposed liquidity mining incentive offered by Ether.fi for weETH suppliers demonstrates a commitment to jumpstart the market on Venus and attract more users. This move positions Venus as a pioneer in capturing the restaking market, catering to the growing demand for LRTs and providing users with a wider range of opportunities. 

Overall, listing weETH on Venus Protocol aligns with the community's focus on decentralization, sustainability, and doing what is right for the Ethereum ecosystem. The proposal not only enhances asset diversity and liquidity but also strengthens the collaboration between Venus and ether.fi to drive innovation and value creation for users.",bullish

13,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-stopping-the-bal-for-gas-initiative/2282).

## Background
The BAL for Gas initiative was introduced as a measure to entice and help users interested in trading ERC-20 tokens through the Balancer trading platform.

The introduction of the Gnosis partnership, however, will allow users to trade without requiring ETH for gas, so the gas reimbursement program becomes obsolete.

The initial proposal by @rabmarut can be found [here.](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705)
The V2 Bal for Gas proposal by @rabmarut can be found [here.](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-bal-for-gas-on-balancer-v2/1861)

## Core Proposal
Given the conditions outlined above, I propose stopping this initiative with immediate effect.

## Risk Assessment
The halting of this program might result in a reduction in trading activity, from those first-time users not familiar with Balancer inner mechanisms (claiming function and Gnosis).

## Open Questions

    Based on Michael Egorov's proposal, published on Novermer 5th 2023,  the main aim is to deploy Venus Protocol on the Ethereum Mainnet. This decision is driven by the fact that Ethereum has the highest liquidity and capital deployed, making it a favorable platform for on-chain trades. 

Furthermore, the proposal suggests listing Curve tokens, crvUSD and CRV, as collaterals on Ethereum, along with proposing CRV/XVS rewards for the benefit of the Venus community, Curve ecosystem, and Ethereum as a whole. 

The rationale behind this proposal is threefold. Firstly, the Ethereum Mainnet requires more lending protocols, and the presence of Venus would help to fill this gap. 

Secondly, deploying Venus on the Ethereum Mainnet would create visibility and brand awareness for the protocol. 

Lastly, Curve, being a leading AMM with a stablecoin (crvUSD) that maintains a close peg, aims to be present in all lending protocols and enhance adoption for crvUSD. 

The proposal also outlines the details for the core pool on Venus, isolated pools on Venus, liquidity mining incentive for crvUSD suppliers, and the creation of pools on Curve. The plan includes setting supply and borrow caps for different assets, such as crvUSD, CRV, and other stablecoins, as well as incentivizing liquidity providers with CRV rewards. 

Additionally, the proposal suggests creating various pools on Curve, such as VAI/crvUSD, XVS/crvUSD, and XVS/VAI on the Ethereum Mainnet. The aim is to help Venus assets find liquidity and facilitate the creation of these pools on BSC once Curve is deployed there. 

Finally, the proposal highlights the importance of obtaining a gauge for the curve pool, which would allow liquidity providers to receive CRV tokens as rewards. This gauge would require a positive vote from Curve Dao, and owning veCRV or other veCRV liquid tokens would grant voting rights. 

Overall, the proposal aims to deploy Venus on the Ethereum Mainnet, list Curve tokens, incentivize liquidity providers, and collaborate with Curve to create pools that benefit the Venus community, Curve ecosystem, and the broader Ethereum network.",bearish

Title: [ARFC] Harmonize USDT Risk Parameters on Aave V3 Markets 
Author: Aave Chan Initiative
Created: 2023-11-11

---

# Summary

USDT has various risk parameters across the various Aave v3 markets. This proposals aims to harmonize the risk parameters to better align the markets by removing USDT from isolation mode and normalizing risk parameters.

# Motivation

USDT has seen strong borrow demand across networks with borrow utilization over 50% on Aave v3 Ethereum Mainnet and good utilization on secondary networks. However, the various markets currently have different risk parameters, leading to some inefficiency.

This proposal aims to bring the various USDT markets in line with a single set of LTV, liquidation threshold, and liquidation bonus parameters.

# Specification

The proposal sets the LT/LTV of USDT on all deployments at 80/77, matching that of DAI and USDC on v3 Ethereum. Regarding the LB, it will stay the same at 5% on the L2s and 4.5% on Ethereum.
 
![Params USDT.png](ipfs://bafkreidwofkwkptb4m6napyclkuzqbyf63um2hdhlcvkx5evtuobnznmcq)

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the Dragon Kart Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a KART-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

#### What is Dragon Kart?

From the team: “Dragon Kart is the first 3D Play-to-Earn Battle Racing game built on Binance Smart Chain. The characters in the game are taken from a Pikalong comics series by a Vietnamese well-known artist Thang Fly. This series has been exposed to millions of Vietnamese users in Zalo, the most used communication app in Vietnam for roughly 5 years.”

### TLDR:
- In April, the UADP submitted an application to participate in the Arbitrum LTIPP (long term incentive program pilot)
- We were able to receive 1,000,000 of ARB, the largest amount out of all other DEX applicants
- In our application, we stated that “the UADP will request the Uni DAO to decide whether or not it wants to partially match this 1.0M ARB ask. The options the DAO has to vote on are four: $250k, $500k, $750k, and $1M. We cannot guarantee that the DAO will vote to match incentives, but we will make a best-effort attempt and report the results of the temperature check”
- We will be collaborating with Gauntlet and Merkl to distribute the incentives (cost breakdowns are below)
- To those ends, we are running this temperature check to see if the DAO is interested in matching the given LTIPP grant to some capacity

### About the LTIPP Application

Uniswap did not apply to the first two rounds of Arbitrum incentives (STIP 1 & 2). This was for two reasons:
- Native DEXs and smaller protocols deserve a chance to make a name for themselves and perhaps offer unique protocols for trading
- We did not have a formal structure like the UADP to help facilitate an application

Since many native DEXs–and non-native ones–have already had the chance to apply for ARB incentives throughout the past year across multiple incentive distribution initiatives, the UADP decided that it’s now the right time for Uniswap to also partake in these programs, especially since other blue-chip protocols also applied for these incentives. Plus, the establishment of this committee has allowed Uniswap DAO to further mature its relationship with Arbitrum DAO. We’ve partaken in multiple discourses, participating in all of the votes taking place on Arbitrum since November 2023.

The LTIPP pilot program is a 3-month long incentive program, with 45M worth of ARB to be distributed among an elected group of protocols. A total of 174 applications were vetted by the LTIPP Advisors, with whom we interacted and obtained feedback during the month of March. One of the primary sticking points was the amount of capital that we initially requested, along with clarifications around some of the target KPIs behind our request.

After some deliberation, in line with many other projects, we ended up lowering our ARB ask from 2.5M to 1M, which increased our chances of being admitted into the program by the Advisors and ARB delegates. Uniswap was able to attain the largest amount of incentives from the cohort of DEX applicants:.

### Uniswap LTIPP Grant Structure and Execution

Below is a breakdown of how the LTIPP funds will be used:
- 900k ARB for incentives: 882k ARB: The bulk of these funds will be used to incentivize liquidity providers on Uniswap using Gauntlet’s dynamic optimization engine. 18k ARB: For Merkl to distribute the funds. Merkl charges based on a percentage of the incentives distributed.
- 85k ARB for Gauntlet: they will dedicate part of its Applied Research team, the same team currently managing the Uniswap/Arbitrum liquidity mining program, to this initiative.
- 15k ARB for UADP: These funds will be sent to the UADP multisig with the goal of making this meta-governance initiative a self-sustaining program. This will allow Uniswap DAO to maintain its voting participation in the Arbitrum DAO.

In order for us to accept this grant, we had to elect three signers onto a Gnosis Safe, and each member had to follow Arbitrum Foundation’s KYC process.

Multisig Address: 0x1026D3D219098D7b1B0A180F7E557DEeA7DA82C1 (⅔ Signers)
- @Juanbug (UADP), 0xB8Dcad009E533066F12e408075E10E3a30F1f15A
- @AbdullahUmar (UADP), 0x3d0e30031b547737fFCf13c127350159A6C4ce17
- Picodes (Merkl), 0x34Eb88EAD486A09CAcD8DaBe013682Dc5F1DC41D

All performance reporting will be conducted by Gauntlet, just as they have been providing analytics regarding their previous Arb-Uniswap incentive program.

### Incentive Matching

It’s clear that Uniswap has a steeped history with Arbitrum. We are currently the dominant DEX by TVL and volume on the L2. After ETH L1, Arbitrum is where Uniswap has the largest stronghold. It is therefore important for delegates to potentially consider doubling down on this ecosystem.

Uniswap DAO and Arbitrum DAO have also conducted themselves symbiotically ever since Uniswap launched on the L2 in August, 2021. Below are some contributions that Uniswap has made to the Arbitrum ecosystem in the past year alone:
- Gauntlet has shipped out a Dynamic Incentive Optimization for Uniswap V3
- Uniswap/Arbitrum liquidity mining mid-point retrospective
- Set up a Uniswap-Arbitrum Working Group
- Funded a ~$2m Uniswap-Arbitrum Grants Program
- Created an active metagovernance group (Uniswap-Arbitrum Delegate Program)

Now that Uniswap has attained 1M ARB from Arbitrum, we are fulfilling our end of the bargain to see if Uniswap would like to reciprocate to some level:

As mentioned, it is up to Uniswap delegates to decide whether or not matching is favorable. Doing so would signify to the Arbitrum community our continued support, and in the UADP’s opinion, allow for further collaboration and grants in the future. If any funds are approved, they will follow a similar distribution structure and execution as above and be grouped together in Gauntlet’s incentives allocation.

21,"#### ABSTRACT

This AIP supports the MVP launch of an outdoor digital billboard network, with a primary objective of establishing a long-term sustainable business model that; helps fund the ApeCoin DAO treasury, establishes new use cases for $APE, expands the community of $APE builders, while providing the world with a progressively decentralized platform to showcase messaging and art.

We’ve bootstrapped this startup on our initiative, with our own money, and designed it to provide numerous direct benefits to the $APE ecosystem. We’re asking the $APE community to help us accelerate the concept and increase its chances of success. We hope that by leading with actions instead of promises, with our skin in the game first, and by placing a high priority on driving direct value to the DAO, the Ape community will choose to support this.

If this AIP passes, then; 20% of all top-line revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin DAO treasury until the full cost of this AIP is returned. Anyone can earn a 10% rewards payout from all referrals. Every wallet hodling at least 5k $APE as at January 1st, 2024, will receive free display space on a first come first serve basis. Furthermore, for however long the Ape community continues to support this initiative, a further 1% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin Treasury on-going, plus a quantity of TBD display space will be reserved for use by the ApeCoin DAO, and our Network of frens and fam, such as those at Mocaverse, BAYC, MAYC, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild, and Ape Delegates, for life.

The outdoor digital advertising industry is ripe for disruption and we’re all positioned to spearhead and benefit from this for years to come. Our modernized approach to this old-school industry offers the potential to generate substantially increased operating margins than competitors and opens up the total addressable market (TAM) by an order of magnitude. The conservative financial request in this AIP covers six months of runway for my team and I to carry out up to two consecutive MVP engagements aimed at positioning this initiative for sustainable revenue generation and future scaling.

I initiated this project in Q4 2019 with a personal investment of approximately $40,000. However, the onset of the Covid lockdown in Q1 2020 forced me to put the project on hold. I have now re-commenced the project with @thebossdragon as CTO, having injected a further $10,000 of my own capital in recent weeks.

The first MVP engagement takes place over a 10-day period during the Ethereum Denver Blockchain/Web3 Event scheduled for February/March 2024, with an anticipated attendance of approximately 15,000 Ethereum-related enthusiasts. We’ve leased a truck equipped on 3-sides with sizeable digital display screens to roam the streets of the event area. Its mission is to display messages and art, while recruiting more builders into the Ape ecosystem, and providing all hodlers of at least 1 $APE with an opportunity to help drive value into the DAO treasury while earning rewards for themselves too. If successful, the model will then scale beyond mobile advertising to encompass highway billboards, transit vehicles, bus stop displays, elevator displays, and more.

Accessibility and speed are key features of this initiative. Anyone can purchase a display spot at any time for the minimum purchase price of 0.001 ETH, and have their messaging displayed within 60 seconds or less. Anyone holding 1 $APE can earn referral rewards, and anyone who pays with $APE receives bonus display time for free. Furthermore, a portion of all ad space will be reserved for free use by the ApeCoin DAO as it sees fit, and for our ecosystem frens. One such use could be the promotion of a ‘Build with $APE’ introductory guide and promotional video, which is included in the budget of this AIP, and which would be integrated into this project’s website: [publicbored.com](http://www.publicbored.com/).

The proposed budget encompasses technology development, website development, display rental expenses, marketing efforts, and a total of twelve months to transition into a self-sustaining model.

Subsequent MVP engagements are TBD in 2024.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

1. 20% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin DAO treasury until the full cost of this AIP is returned.
2. Anyone can earn a 10% rewards/payout for all referrals who purchase display time on the digital billboard
4. On-going royalties plus free ads: for as long as the Ape community continues to support this initiative, a further 1% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin Treasury on-going, plus a quantity of TBD ad space on all billboards everywhere shall always be reserved for use by the ApeCoin DAO, and our Network of frens and fam, such as $APE hodlers, Mocaverse, BAYC, MAYC, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild, and Ape Delegates hodling 50k $APE or more, for life.
5. Bonus, free display time is also given to everyone who pays in $APE.
6. Free display space is reserved exclusively for ApeCoin DAO use, such as for recruiting more builders into the Ape ecosystem.
7. We also aim to help recruit more $APE builders, via a guide for new AIP authors posted directly on the Public Bored website to help direct website traffic towards the DAO, or similar.
8. 25% of all revenue generated will be converted into and held in $APE on-going, until the funds need to be used, in which case we will actively seek to pay expenses in $APE wherever practical. For example, part of the cost of the billboard truck has been paid for directly using $APE. This was their first time accepting $APE as payment, and only happened because I specifically asked them to. It was a fun discussion, and they are excited :slight_smile: 

#### OVERALL COST

Total Budget: 75,000 $APE

Approximate allocations:
* Digital Display Truck: 15k $APE
  * Acquisition of cutting-edge mobile canvas
* Website & Technology Development: 20k $APE
  * Advancing innovation through web and tech

23,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.


## Specification

This past week did not see outsized changes in market conditions nor within the Aave protocol. There were slight volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets. Our platform recommends the following set of parameter changes that will decrease liquidation bonuses on several less-utilized assets.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAL Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |
| DPI Loan To Value     | 65%     | 70%     |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| DPI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |
| ENJ Loan To Value    | 60%     | 70%     |
| MANA Loan To Value    | 65%     | 70%     |
| MKR Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| UNI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |

28,"## Simple Summary

Gauntlet's risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify risk parameters, including Loan To Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across 6 assets on Ethereum v3, Arbitrum v3 and Ethereum v2. For more details, see the full forum post [here]( https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825/1).


## Motivation

These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations and they seek to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, the expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics shown in the [full forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825) can help understand why some parameter recommendations have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for the recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.
For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

## Specification

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at reasonable levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. Our simulations show that we can improve the balance of risk and capital efficiency by making the parameter changes specified below.

Ethereum Aave v3 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Title : [ARFC] wGHO Aave V3 Onboarding

## Author : Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs

## Date: 2023-09-15
---
## Summary

This proposal aims to onboard wGHO, an ERC-20 token wrapper of GHO, as a collateral-only asset in a newly created stablecoin emode within the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.

## Motivation

The onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.

This integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.

Alongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.

It's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.

wGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. 

## Specification

The ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:

- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset & isolation mode asset.
- wGHO parameters:

| LTV | 77% |
| --- | --- |
| LT | 80%  |
| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |
| Supply Cap | 1M |
| Borrow Cap | 0 |
| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |

### Note:

wGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.

Onboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.

## Disclaimer

The Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The he author have both large GHO debt & GHO holdings. The ACI uses GHO to fund the [Orbit program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241).

## Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback and consensus on this ARFC.
2. Escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot Stage.
3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE approved, escalate to AIP stage.

32,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z consumers via extremely popular and influential social media personalities on Instagram, Tik Tok, and Youtuber. The goal is to create awareness within the normies and introduce them to the Bored Ape Yacht Club as the best club in the world despite not having a club or any yachts, and that ApeCoin is the future of finance that will lead to financial freedom despite not having any utility or real world use cases.

By Achieving this goal we hope to increase demand for Apes and get hundreds or maybe even thousands of normies to come buy our bags. If we can convince them into truly believing that Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin are cool, we hope they will buy them to be a part of this great community with no interest of ever selling for a profit, resulting in an increased holder count. This can potentially get Apes out of the hands of Blur farmers and traders who only buy Apes to flip them for a 0.01 eth profit (or loss).
MAGA - Make Apes Great Again

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Increased holder count… This may or may not bring in a few thousand new ApeCoin bag holders.
New community members and DAO participants… We may or may not get a few thousand new plebs to complain about how down bad they are.

More hate and ridicule… We may get a bunch of people to make fun of and talk bad about Apes. But there’s no such thing as bad publicity right? Whether the things they say are good or bad they will be talking about us.

The idea is to convince the normies that Apes are cool and they need to be like us. To make them realize that the Bored Ape Yacht Club is the best club in the world and they need to join this club asap before they can no longer afford to join.

The only way to find out if it works is to FAFO. The more we FA, the more we FO. If we don’t FA, we’ll never FO.

The one benefit I can guarantee for sure is that 1000 community members will get to claim a free Twisted Ape Treasure Chest. I have 1000 of these Treasure Chests in stock and ready to ship. They are currently priced at 69 $APE, but if this AIP is approved, I will make them a free claim to the first 1000 wallets that vote on this AIP, regardless whether they vote yes or no.

We will also include delegated voters. If you delegate your votes to another wallet or are part of a sub community that votes separately such as Surreal or Mocaverse, our dev team will get all your wallet addresses from the snapshot and include you in the free claim.

I will post the winners of these Chests here on the forum as well as on X and Discord. I will ensure everyone finds out about it by making public announcements on as many Twitter spaces as I can get on. We will not request any personal information directly, however the claim will be made on our Shopify website with the standard checkout process similar to every other ecommerce store on Shopify. So mailing addresses will be as safe as they usually are as with any other order users place online.

If there are less than 1000 voters and delegates and we have some leftover Treasure Chests, then we will make them available for free to all ApeCoin holders via a random raffle system.

# What is the new IFO 3.0 Format?

Stake, stake, stake! Starting with this IFO, your max CAKE commitment limit for the IFO will be set by your average IFO pool staking balance during the calculation period (approx. 7 days from 14-21 Dec 21). For more details, check out our [**Medium post**](https://medium.com/pancakeswap/initial-farm-offering-ifo-3-0-ifo-staking-pool-622d8bd356f1) to learn more!

# What is Diviner Protocol?
 
**Diviner Protocol** aims to build up a metaverse “Diviner Harbor City” to offer users a lossless & gamified prediction marketplace by combining the best of DeFi and NFTs.

# What is $DPT? 

$DPT is the governance token as well as the in-game currency of Diviner Protocol.

# $DPT Token Distribution

![](https://i.imgur.com/UeH5gqW.png)

Following the IFO, approximately 5.1% of the total supply will be circulating in the market.

# IFO Sales Details  
- **Sale start time:** Approx. 100pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21
- **Sale end time:** Approx. 130pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21
- **Amount to be raised:** $600,000 USD in **CAKE tokens**
- **Tokens to be sold:** 24,000,000 DPT (2.4% of initial DPT total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 DPT = $0.025 USD
All CAKE raised from the DPT token sale will be given to the IFO project. Only CAKE raised from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Basic Sale and Unlimited Sale (via the Overflow method), with Commitment Limit determined by IFO Credits.

# What is the new IFO CAKE Pool?

TLDR: Stake CAKE in the IFO CAKE pool, and get higher IFO allocations!

From 14-21 Dec 21 (IFO CAKE Pool Calculation Period), every CAKE staked in the IFO CAKE Pool counts towards your CAKE Credit Calculation. Stake more CAKE, receive more IFO Credits, and get higher IFO allocations! [**More details here**](https://medium.com/pancakeswap/initial-farm-offering-ifo-3-0-ifo-staking-pool-622d8bd356f1).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

TLDR: The more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent.

In the “Overflow” method, users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the IFO, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale.

# To participate in the IFO:

#### Before Sale:
- [**Create an active PancakeSwap profile**](https://pancakeswap.finance/profile)
- [**Buy CAKE tokens**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/swap)

#### During Sale:

While the sale is live (100pm – 130pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21), commit your CAKE tokens to buy DPT tokens at [*pancakeswap.finance/ifo*](https://pancakeswap.finance/ifo).

#### After Sale:

When the sale is complete, claim your DPT tokens and your unspent funds will also be sent back to you.

Done!

If you decide to acquire CAKE tokens before the IFO starts, you can stake them [***here***](https://pancakeswap.finance/pools) to earn CAKE token rewards while waiting for the sale.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Basic Sale ($180,000, which is 30% of Sale allocation)

In the “Basic” session, each person can contribute a MAXIMUM of $100 equivalent in CAKE tokens.

Note that the final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session, but the good news is you’re not battling any whales.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZkcXSvt.png)

#### Unlimited Sale ($420,000, which is 70% of Sale Allocation)

The “Unlimited” session has no limits on the amount each person can contribute. However, this comes at the cost of a participation fee.

How much is the participation fee?

There is a 1% participation fee which decreases in cliffs, based on the percentage of overflow from the “Unlimited” portion of the sale.

The fee cliff is as follows:


**Overflow multiplier**

![](https://i.imgur.com/qH3hylcm.png)


In the “Unlimited Sale” method, users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the IFO, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale.


![](https://i.imgur.com/a4syJ9Z.png)

Please note — The final USD price per CAKE token will be set a few minutes before the sale (starting at approx. 100pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21) and will be broadcasted on all channels.

A Syrup Pool and Farm for Diviner Protocol will also run at the conclusion of the IFO.

# The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn DPT!

- **Total Tokens:** 8,000,000 DPT
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends
- **Finish time:** Approx. 60 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 4.629 DPT

# The Farm:

In order to host the DPT Syrup Pool, we will need to provide a DPT-BNB farm that will have 2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours and then 1x CAKE rewards after that.

43,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/draft-partnership-agreement-balancerdao-primedao/2363).

## Partnership Purpose
The partnership aims to align the interest of the parties to intensify the collaboration between the organization. With PrimeDAOs relaunch, it seeks to further commit to the building on the Balancer Protocol and supporting the decentralization and development of the BalancerDAO.

The current Prime product suits, consisting of Prime Launch (LBP interface), Prime Rating (research sub-DAO), Prime Pools (DAO governed Balancer Pools) and Prime Deals (Interface for DAO agreements) aim to provide substantial value to BalancerDAO and aligned DAOs.

Commitment of the Organizations
Both parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following towards this partnerships:

## D2D Collaboration

PrimeDAO’s primary aim is enabling D2D collaborations and shares this vision with Balancer. PrimeDAO will support the development of the BalancerDAO and, where possible, share learnings and resources with BalancerDAO.
BalancerDAO will get early access to Prime Deals 2, an Interface for DAO to DAO interactions, such as token swaps co-liquidity provision, and joint venture formation, to give input, to ensure the product serves the needs of BalancerDAO.

## Technical

PrimeDAO will continue to host Balancer LBP through Prime Launch and support the development of LBPs on Balancer.
PrimeDAOs builders will continue to support the development of the Balancer Protocol.
PrimeDAOs will support the development of the Balancer Protocol on alternative blockchains, currently evaluating the deployment of Balancer V2.0 on Celo and xDAI chain in collaboration with Symmetric, with the potential for it to develop into a Balancer Friendly Fork.

## Operational

Both DAOs will actively share DAO operational learnings and workflows, starting with a bi-monthly knowledge-sharing session covering three topics relevant to both DAOs. The first session will be organized in mid-January.

## Marketing

To ensure both entities will profit from each other’s reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where applicable.

## Co-liquidity provision:

To align governance interests, between the two organizations, the creation of a co-liquidity pool is proposed with the following details; 25,000 BAL from the Balancer Ecosystem Fund would be transferred to PrimeDAO at the end of PrimeDAO own LBP to bootstrap a PRIME / BAL pool with 50/50 weights and 2,5% trading fees. Right after the conclusion of the PRIME LBP, PrimeDAO will seed a pool with the 25,000 BAL and match it with the same $ value in Prime. Once the pool is initiated, PrimeDAO will transfer 50% of the Balancer Pool Tokens to the Balancer Ecosystem Fund to complete the transaction.

The pool will again be called the Balancer <> PRIME pool (BLxPR) and function as a liquidity bridge between the two DAOs. The BLxPR pool will be one of the two main liquidity pools for PrimeDAO.

## Governance

The BLxPR token will be added to the Snapshot strategies of both DAOs to allow BLxPR token holders to participate in the Governance of both protocols.
A new snapshot will be set-up with the BLxPR as the governing token. This snapshot will be used to govern issues related to this DAO agreement.

## Pool Optimization

PrimeDAO aims to create deep liquidity between BAL <> PRIME to be able to bring more projects and liquidity to the Balancer Protocol. PrimeDAO aims to do this by actively engaging in D2D agreement with other DAOs and creating PRIME / xxx pools on the Balancer Protocol.
PrimeDAO also aims to leverage the various upcoming Balancer Pools in combination with PrimeDAOs existing products. Prime Rating could potentially be utilized to create research-driven managed pools and Prime Deals could be connected to the Balancer Protocol to allow multiple DAOs to bootstrap a pool together in a completely permissionless way.

## Specification
At the end of the PrimeDAO LBP, the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) will initiate a transaction to send 25,000 BAL to PrimeDAO (0x567d220B0169836cBF351DF70A9c517096ec9De7)

PrimeDAO will match that with an equal USD amount of PRIME to create the BAL<>PRIME pool and send the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) half the BPT's.",neutral

Since the [approval of the CREAM/WETH gauge](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xa8ef52b06d2e5742e9068582276e878441c29a924e8bb2a9c26686d5284a9106) back on May 24th Balancer has earned ~$12k in protocol fees while[ spending ~$1.55M worth of BAL emissions](https://dune.com/tianqi/Balancer-Gauge-Weight). The CREAM gauge is the largest recipient of BAL emissions while returning virtually zero fee revenue to the protocol. Long term mechanisms like the recently passed [“core pools” proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x28bd2c5580f5a8effacdceb0aec52e9bc63987fa4f4a39f8b8223257ca4376cc) should help naturally correct this imbalance as market forces are given time to work though even in an optimistic scenario the CREAM gauge will remain very large for the foreseeable future.

Per [recent discussion](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/discussion-kill-cream-weth-gauge/3396) on the forum the community is split on this issue. Governance did approve the CREAM gauge in a legitimate vote and BAL was bought on the open market and locked in veBAL to vote for it. Governance also has the power to vote to kill any gauge for any reason and everyone participating in veBAL accepts these are the rules.

The Balancer ecosystem has significant funding requirements that currently far exceed our revenue generation based on the last 30 days. At this point in time the largest blocker to Balancer reaching sustainability is the existence of the CREAM gauge. There is enough support in the community for killing the gauge that it is appropriate to move this to a vote in my view - this proposal will be sent to the Governance Council for approval next Thursday, July 14th.

### Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `grantRole` on the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` with the following arguments:

account: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`

The role can be verified [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json). This will give the DAO Multisig the ability to call `killGauge` on a pool's gauge.

53,"Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on Base

Author: @fig - Flipside Crypto

Date: 2023-05-22

---

## Simple Summary

This Temperature Check seeks the community's input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Base mainnet, expanding Aave to a unique, OP-stack network.

## Background

Base is an open-source, developer-friendly L2 EVM blockchain, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. Base is incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase’s on-chain products and a sandbox for permissionless development.

Coinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launch of Base to help realize the Optimism superchain vision. Base testnet is currently live — and mainnet soon around the corner.

Docs are available at [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/)

Its mission and identity are stated clearly in the docs: ***Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users to web3.***

As a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective’s mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.

Four key principles have shaped Base that will continue to guide its approach:


**Open-source**

Base is built on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase is joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone.




**A bridge, not an island**

Base is optimized for easy, secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, as well as other L1 ecosystems like Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. Builders and users may start on Base, but go everywhere Base is a “bridge” for users into the crypto economy.



**Decentralization** 

 Decentralization is essential for the crypto economy ""to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone.” Coinbase is deeply committed to progressing toward full decentralization over the years ahead.


**For everyone**

Base is a vision to be an open ecosystem, seeded with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life.

 
Base has launched with a diverse array of launch partners, servicing different developer and user needs across data, block explorers, bridging, custody, DeFi, and others.

Please see the list below of robust launch partners:

 
![dd6a532ab00053c11ed6070d651915f493105e81_2_1380x712.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihs7se4xncwxlk4lrb3t4lkcsx2o2gkjqj6pt6rxplamuho5b2znm)
    

## Motivation

The Aave community has voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase across other prominent L2s such as Arbiturm, Metis, and Optimism.

By enabling Base on Aave, it creates valuable (and differentiated) revenue opportunities for Aave, capturing the growth and interest of users who live on the Coinbase platform.

Base is a way for Aave to instantly leverage Coinbase’s products and distribution: seamless Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to **110mm+** users and **$80B+** assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.

In the first week of Base, 18k developers deployed 55k smart contracts on testnet. This activity sustained through the network's announcement has the potential to introduce new, valuable users to DeFi and Aave.

Since Base's testnet launch on 02/23/2023, metrics illustrate strong activity:

* 2,000,000 accounts created
* 17,000,000 transactions
* 1,000,000+ addresses holding a Base Builder NFT for participating in in Quests

In addition, Base has shown impressive retention for a blockchain, with ~70,000 unique wallets returning to Base for subsequent transactions within one day. The users, likely early developers, paint a promising outlook for the activity that may be seen on mainnet.

## Specification

This *TEMP CHECK* presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Base mainnet on day one of its launch.

Suggested risk parameters for this asset are provided in the table below.

## Disclaimer

The information provided above about Base is from public sources and Flipside Crypto cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.

For full disclosure, Coinbase partnered with Flipside Crypto upon the announcement of the network to make Base on-chain data available for free for analysts.

Coinbase has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and we are doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.

As a cautionary measure to prevent an appearance of a conflict of interest, Flipside will abstain from voting on this proposal - in line with other proposals we put forward.

This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.

## Next Steps

**Temperature Check:** Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Base Mainnet.

54,"#### ABSTRACT

“It is in giving that we receive.” - Francis of Assisi

The core of this proposal centers around promoting collaboration for the greater good of humanity and making a positive impact on individuals’ health and happiness.

W3 Labs, recognized for their development of dot ape domains on the Ethereum chain, actively supports the decentralized Apecoin token to facilitate transactions, showcasing their dedication to enhancing the utility of the ape coin community. They provide these domains as a means for individuals to establish their digital identity within the Web3 realm and seamlessly engage with popular decentralized applications (dApps).

As an expression of gratitude, this proposal suggests providing the DAO with relevant domains at no expense, along with a monetary contribution to an organization chosen by the DAO/community.

This proposal is simply about extending a helping hand to the DAO’s compassionate virtue, contributing a little from Labs for societal good, and securing digital identity for DAO as well. W3 Labs proposes to donate $50K from their side and would love the ApeCoin DAO to also match that contribution to a charity of DAO’s and community choice.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

* Community Goodwill: A donation from W3 Labs, matched by ApeCoin DAO, demonstrates our commitment to charity efforts and philanthropy goals.

* Helping Others: Empowering individuals in their time of need, providing hope for a better future, supported by the leading Web3 community.

* Increased Visibility: Collaborating with renowned organizations boosts global presence.

* Positive PR and Mainstream Attention: Engaging content promotes ApeCoin's values. Enhanced by custom creatives to highlight our actions across social and digital media.

* Transparency and Accountability: Financial Reports ensure trust in the $100,000 deployment in donation(s).

* Enhanced Digital Security and Identity: Free Dot ape domains on Ethereum improve user identity, security, and trust within Web3.

* Existing Use Case for ApeCoin: Dot ape domains powered by the decentralized $apecoin token adds extra utility to the ApeCoin ecosystem.

#### OVERALL COST

In terms of cost implications, we assure the DAO of our commitment to bear the entirety of the expenses associated with the creation, implementation and operation of this proposal. The DAO's contribution is solely towards matching the $50,000 donation, which will be triggered only after Dot Ape has transferred the equivalent amount to the DAO.

We genuinely believe in the confluence of professionalism, trust, and altruism as we venture into this journey. Looking forward to advancing our shared values in the realm of Web3, and strengthening the spirit of community and compassionate action.

> ""Thank you for your time and support. We, at W3 Labs, remain dedicated to making a positive impact and welcome your input.""

# TLDR:

Proposal to have 45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity between BAL and uncapped tokens (WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC). Wallets flagged as Balancer Labs shareholders don't qualify for this ""liquidity staking"" extra incentive.
The main goals are to significantly increase liquidity on key BAL pairs and to allow non-shareholders to compound their BAL holdings at a much faster pace, accelerating protocol decentralization.

![image|621x500, 50%](upload://5S3GvpjON1hNGnO7wuSfqNd3smk.png)   


# Motivation

The **importance of BAL liquidity** can't be overstated:

* *TRUER PRICE DISCOVERY*: it improves trading conditions for all market participants (lower spreads and less slippage for both buyers and sellers), allowing for a more transparent and effective price discovery process;

* *SUPERIOR LP INCENTIVES*: a stronger token (with higher price inertia) results in a higher quality for the incentives given to LPs (liquidity providers) via liquidity mining;

* *SHARPER GOVERNANCE*: it opens doors to a new class of invaluable stakeholders and protocol governors (e.g. larger investors, especially those heavily involved in and experienced with DeFi protocols);

* *BROADER GOVERNANCE*: with no participation from Balancer Labs' shareholders (more on that later), liquidity staking will accelerate BAL distribution and protocol decentralization by giving all other BAL holders the opportunity to compound their governance rights at a much faster pace;

* *SAFER GOVERNANCE*: pools are non-custodial and BAL in them retain full voting power (i.e. no need to withdraw liquidity to vote), such that high liquidity and a healthy governance are not in conflict;

Balancer itself being a DEX, it feels only natural as the ideal venue for high BAL liquidity to be incentivized. Finally, it's worth noting that allowing a high portion of the token supply to be concentrated on *centralized* exchanges could expose the governance to significant risks, as illustrated by the episode with STEEM.


# Recapping: how liquidity adjustment currently works

The 145k BAL [weekly distribution](https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/bal-liquidity-mining) to LPs on Balancer is calculated proportionally to the *adjusted* liquidity contributed by each LP. This adjustment is made by applying (i.e. multiplying) a few *factors* to their liquidity measured in dollar terms.

Naturally, the value of those factors can be:
* equal to `1`, having no effect;
* less than `1`, acting as a penalty (when the liquidity is deemed less useful);
* greater than `1`, acting as an extra incentive.

A `feeFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-feefactor-toward-reducing-the-mining-penalty-for-high-fee-pools/103)) applies a small penalty to pools with higher fees.

**For each pair inside a pool**, we apply:
*  a `wrapFactor` of:
   * `1.0` for uncorrelated pairs (no penalty),
   * `0.2` for [soft pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-wrapfactor-applying-a-0-2-factor-to-soft-pegged-pairs/138),
   * `0.1` for [hard pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/wrapfactor-penalizing-pairs-of-equivalent-tokens-in-liquidity-mining/28); and 

* a `BRF` (BAL & Ratio Factor), which is the combination of a `ratioFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/introduction-of-a-weight-ratio-factor-in-liquidity-mining/15)) and a `stakingBoost ≥ 1` (described in [this proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102) and with further calculation details specified in its [ammendment](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102/4)). 
`BRF = stakingBoost * ratioFactor`
  * If the pair is **not** of type `{BAL & uncapped_token}` (uncapped tokens currently being: WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC, BAL), then its `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. the incentive doesn't apply to this pair).

The current `BRF` will only depend on the characteristics of the pool (its tokens and weights), and may have a maximum value of `1.54`. It looks like this:

![image|690x455, 75%](upload://xqztRzplangZYzS0j70jlwfgc7P.png) 

After looping through all possible pairs in a pool, we combine their factors (via [weighted average](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/master/lib/factors.js#L111)) and the result is a `wrapFactor` and a `BRF` for the whole pool. 

Finally, we calculate and apply a `tokenCapFactor` adjusting down the liquidity of a token when it exceeds a predetermined maximum. Except for the 5 uncapped tokens already mentioned, all tokens eligible for liquidity mining are currently capped at $10M each. See more details on [how to calculate it](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56) and the [recent changes](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217) to how token caps will evolve.

# The Proposal

This is a proposal to have **45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity staking**.

This extra incentive is:

> all BAL distributed as a result of applying a `stakingBoost > 1` to the liquidity of `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs, from wallets which are not flagged as shareholders of Balancer Labs.

The remaining **100k BAL would be distributed to all LPs** in all eligible pools, disconsidering the effect of a `stakingBoost` (i.e. all liquidity being subject to `BRF = ratioFactor`).

The constant value now would be: `STAKERS_SHARE = 45000 / 145000`, and we can then calculate the unique value for `stakingBoost` that satisfies this target distribution. 

The intended result is for BAL liquidity on Balancer to increase substantially, **but in a self-regulated way**. 

The simple yet powerful idea is: as BAL liquidity gets higher the extra incentive to staking gets **diluted among stakers**, so that our constant target for `STAKERS_SHARE` is met.

In a more visual approach:
 
* when non-shareholder BAL liquidity is low, the `stakingBoost` will be high, resulting in a high `BRF` (a hypothetical scenario being the **orange** curve in the graph below, in which `BRF` peaks at `12`), so there will be a *very strong* incentive for BAL liquidity to increase;

* when non-shareholer BAL liquidity is high (the desired scenario), the `stakingBoost` will have come down to lower levels, resulting in a lower BRF (a hypothetical scenario being the **green** curve below, in which `BRF` peaks at `3`).

![image|621x500](upload://oI5XnPgsZE1VcQWDyeJCWovr1IV.png)  

# Calculating the stakingBoost: a practical example

We first calculate the `liquidityPreStaking`: the total adjusted liquidity from applying all factors, but with `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. `BRF = ratioFactor`). Let's say the result was $200M.

We will need to apply a yet unknown stakingBoost so that:
```STAKERS_SHARE = (finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / finalLiquidity```

... which can also be stated as:
```finalLiquidity = liquidityPreStaking / (1 - STAKERS_SHARE)```

In our example:
```finalLiquidity = $200M / (1 - 45000/145000) = $290M```

We may apply any temporary `tempStakingBoost > 1` to `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs from non-shareholder LPs, resulting in a `tempLiquidity`. Let's say our result was $230M. This would mean the `tempStakingBoost` increased the adjusted liquidity in $30M, while what we actually want is an increase of $90M.

Now to get the desired `stakingBoost`, we only need to ""stretch"" or ""shrink"" the `tempStakingBoost` according to the ratio between the two liquidity adjustments (desired & temporary):

```
(finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / (tempLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
```
... which in our example would result in:
```
(290 - 200) / (230 - 200) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
stakingBoost = 3 * tempStakingBoost
```

# Shareholder Addresses

An important aspect of this proposal is that Balancer Labs shareholders (investors, advisors and founders) seem aligned with the spirit of the proposal: to accelerate governance rights distribution. In order to achieve this goal, their wallets will be excluded from participating in liquidity staking. This restriction doesn't apply to eventual BAL they hold that are unrelated to their shareholder allocations, for instance BAL bought on the market or earned through being LPs with tokens other than their BAL shareholder allocation.

[Here is the complete list of shareholder addresses to be excluded from liquidity staking](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/liquidity-staking/src/users.ts).

Note: wallets currently tagged as ""Balancer: Shareholder XX"" on Etherscan are actually *vesting smart contracts* which hold mostly locked (i.e. yet unvested) BAL. Vesting happens continuously and linearly over a period of 3 years which started at token launch (2020-06-20). When finally vested (i.e. free to transfer), BAL can only be withdrawn to the respective beneficiary address of each vesting contract. The addresses listed above are the 51 unique beneficiaries of the 51 vesting contracts. All the BAL balance they already hold is vested.

The community is willing to tolerate up to about 10k BAL per week per shareholder being sent to centralized exchanges as they are cognizant of shareholders also seeking to deleverage their BAL positions over time, without attempting to subvert the exclusion list. In case some large BAL balances move to third-party custody solutions held in segregated addresses or to multisig wallets (both situations are likely to happen), the current list may be updated to reflect those new shareholder addresses as also excluded from liquidity staking.

The community will have the prerogative to update this list so that changes are effective already before any still pending weekly distribution.",bullish
58,"### Background:

Uniswap’s [genesis liquidity incentive program](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) ends on Nov 17. The existing program distributed 20 million UNI to LPs over 2 months, split evenly between the WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, and DAI/ETH pools. This works out to 2.5 million UNI per pool, per month.

#### Benefits of UNI distribution to LPs:

* Ongoing incentives allows UNI to be distributed to those providing value in the form of liquidity
* The incentivized pools are likely to remain the most liquid DEX pair on Ethereum, providing a venue to trade against ETH at virtually any size with zero slippage.
* Reduced incentives prevents UNI from being distributed ‘too fast’, marked by all tokens being distributed before the Foundation’s four year vesting has passed.

#### Drawbacks of UNI distribution to LPs:

* Ongoing incentives result in UNI largely being ‘farmed and dumped’ to earn yield. See ETH USD Yield Farm, Pickle, Harvest and Alpha.
* Reduced incentives means UNI is distributed slower.
* Incentivizing the same pools can be seen as choosing ‘winners’ by selecting WBTC as THE Bitcoin on Ethereum and favoring certain stablecoins over others.

### Proposed new distribution:

Distribute UNI for an additional 2 months from the time this proposal is adopted and executed by governance. Distribute to the same 4 pools, but at half the rate of the genesis distribution. This works out to 1.25 million UNI per month to each of the 4 covered pools (WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, DAI/ETH), for a total of 5M UNI per month, or 10M UNI total over the next 2 months.

Please see the liquidity incentive [governance plan document](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590) for full details and timelines.

### Temperature check question:

Should Uniswap distribute UNI to liquidity providers per the specifications outlined above?

### Next steps:

The snapshot poll will be live for 3 days. If the poll passes with a minimum of 25,000 UNI in support, this proposal will move forward to the consensus check phase.

63,"*Summary*

Despite being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols, Uniswap’s outstanding voting power does not necessarily translate into active governance participation. In fact, many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50% vote participation rate, and some even as low as 10% or 0%. While there have been previous [campaigns ](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1653077861706739714?s=20) to encourage delegation by large UNI holders, we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated, if at all.

In healthy governance environments, proactive delegates wield significant voting power, ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met.

Therefore, this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate 2.5 million UNI to each of 4 active yet underrepresented delegates selected based on the criteria outlined below. To ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum (as explained further in Participation Requirements) or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will 1 year term so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without fulling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.

*Landscape of Uniswap Governance*

Despite numerous improvements to Uniswap’s governance, there are still several areas that require further improvement. One prominent area is governance participation, which has witnessed a downward trend compared to late 2022 and early 2023.

Another issue is many large delegates are now inactive, and the delegators who entrusted them with delegation are either unaware about this inactivity or simply do not care. For example, there is currently several delegates with more than 2.5 million UNI delegated who never even voted onchain according to Tally, see the screenshot below.

*Source: Tally*

Therefore, further distributing governance power to active but underrepresented delegates is a positive step forward ensuring governance is more active, resilient, and robust.

**Participation Requirements**

* Must have voted on 80% (or more) of proposals (minus the proposals that were canceled) over the last 3 months (as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot). This includes both Snapshot and Onchain proposals (such as Tally or Agora)
* Must have actively participated in proposal voting for more than 3 months and have a Delegate Platform on Uniswap Forum under Delegation Pitch

**Application Criteria**

* Meets the above Participation Requirements
* Voting Power is less than 2.5 million UNI (as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot).

**Next Steps**

* Should this proposal pass on Snapshot, a 5-day period will begin where delegates that meet the above criterias are encouraged to post their application to be considered for delegation. In cases where there are more than Four qualified applicants, there will be an additional Snapshot vote to determine the top Four. Once Four or fewer applicants are selected (in case there are not enough delegates that meet the criteria), it will proceed to an onchain vote.

**Other Clarification**

-The term will be 1 year from when 2.5 M UNI is delegated.

-Should the onchain vote be approved but there are three or fewer qualified applicants because there are not enough qualified applicants, there WON'T be a subsequent application period and Snapshot vote after the initial vote to fill the remaining available recipients.

-Should the onchain vote be approved and there are qualified applicants but one or more of them are disqualified in the future due to their low vote participation, there will NOT be a new application and snapshot vote to give the opportunity to another delegate.

-As mentioned by in a previous [proposal ](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-onboarding-ekubo-inc-as-a-core-developer-of-uniswap-protocol/22085/20) seeking UNI delegation, there will be deployment of at max four new [Franchiser ](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/blob/main/spec.md) contracts, each one funded with 2.5M UNI (10M UNI total). The owner of these Franchiser instance’s would be the Timelock, while the at max four delegates chosen through the voting process outlined above can act as the delegatees.",bullish
64,"### Background
Per andy8052 on the [Uniswap forums](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-to-arbitrum-mainnet/12451):
...there is immense value in being available for swaps on every EVM compatible network. Since there is no liquidity mining, it is hard to make the case that multiple deployments will segment liquidity, and long term if this is an issue governance can flip the switch on liquidity incentives for the chains it desires deepest liquidity. In the meantime, not deploying to new and growing networks like Arbitrum and Matic just allows for other exchanges to come in and fill that spot. This could potentially eat into fees earned by governance in the future.

Alongside this, it will help to grow the potential list of projects that can be built on Uniswap v3. Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing with and using the v3 codebase will only expedite Uniswap adoption on all chains as the code and integrations become more battle tested.

Arbitrum launches later this week on May 28th. I think it would be best to start a discussion ASAP around deploying the Uniswap v3 code to Arbitrum network.

### Next Steps
Indicate your interest for Uniswap moving forward with a deployment of Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum, by (1) opening the Uniswap v3 license to include code deployed on Arbitrum, (2) allowing community developers to implement Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum.",bullish

67,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust six (6) total risk parameters including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. In addition, Gauntlet recommends freezing legacy KNC. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

## Specification


Our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. 

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| DAI Loan To Value     | 75%     | 77%     |
| LINK Liquidation Bonus     | 6.5%     | 6.3%     |
| LINK Liquidation Threshold    | 75%     | 78%     |
| USDC Loan To Value    | 82.5%     | 85.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Bonus    | 4.0%     | 4.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Threshold    | 85%     | 86%     |



See below volatility and exchange volume data from 03/17 to 03/31. These are useful metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations.

| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| DAI   | 	0.180079852     |  0.18048045   | 	-0.000400598   | 2.9325893   |

## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. 

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

As of 3/28/2022, roughly 195M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdefa4e8a7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 57M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There are currently $2.9M KNCL supplied and $900K total borrowed on Aave v2.

Considering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.

69,"Title: [ARC] Risk Parameter Updates for Ethereum Aave v2 Market
author: @MarcZeller @MatthewGraham @Llamaxyz 
created: 20-08-2022

## Simple Summary

In response to Tribe DAO’s proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by FEI borrowers to the Reserve Factor.

## Abstract

Tribe DAO is dissolving the DAO’s assets and TRIBE governance token. As a result, FEI will become backed 1:1 with DAI and redeemable 1FEI:1DAI. With Tribe DAO transitioning into a terminal state, the FEI stablecoin will overtime be redeemed for DAI.

As FEI is redeemed for DAI, over time FEI’s circulating supply and liquidity will also fall away. Without sufficient liquidity, liquidations can not be performed efficiently which creates a risk for the Ethereum Aave v2 market.

In response to recent events, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. A separate forum post will emerge that recommends all aFEI be redeemed for FEI and swapped for DAI via the contracts deployed by Tribe DAO.

This proposal is to disable lending and borrowing of FEI whilst enabling existing debt to be repaid and collateral to be withdrawn.

## Motivation

With the emergence of news that Tribe DAO intends to dissolve FEI and the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) backing the stablecoin, there is a need to amend the FEI lending market in preparation of the risks to emerge with transition Tribe DAO to a terminal state.

The details around how Tribe DAO will transition from current state to terminal state can be found [here](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475).

As FEI will be redeemed for DAI, the stablecoin will suffer diminishing liquidity and diminishing supply. This renders the FEI stablecoin not suitable as a supported asset on Aave markets.

## Specification

The recommendation is to disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor.

**Risk Parameters:**

Freeze the FEI market which will:

Borrowing Enabled → Disable 
Lending Enabled → Disable 

Also,

Reserve Factor 20% → 100%

## Next Steps

The next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the **earliest 24th August 2022**, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to modify FEI risk parameters as outlined above at the earliest possible date **29th August 2022**.

Gauge Proposal Template:

**Summary:**
> Swell DAO proposes the creation of a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a swETH-bb-a-WETH pool on mainnet, with a 10% emissions cap.

**References/Useful links:**

> Link to:
    • Website -> swellnetwork.io
    • Documentation -> docs.swellnetwork.io
    • Github Page -> https://github.com/SwellNetwork
    • Discord -> https://discord.gg/swellnetwork
    • Twitter: https://twitter.com/swellnetworkio?lang=en

**Protocol Description:**

> The Swell DAO was formed to build a liquid staking protocol to provide the holders of Ethereum (ETH) the means to earn yield through staking without the constraint of locking up capital. 
Swell’s mission is to create a more secure, decentralized and transparent financial future for the world that does not discriminate or censor economic freedom. The beginning of that journey for Swell starts with continuing to advance liquid staking as one of the fundamental building blocks of modern day decentralized finance (DeFi) that is composable and fully integrated with the Ethereum ecosystem. Similar to other LST protocols, Swell issues a liquid receipt token (swETH) representing your share of ether staked on the Beacon Chain via a permissioned validator set. The exchange rate between swETH/ETH will gradually increase as staking rewards accumulate, though swETH is not redeemable for the ether principal and rewards until after the Ethereum Shappella upgrade that will allow stakers to withdraw from the beacon chain.

**Motivation:**

> Swell is currently is looking to host a swETH-ETH pool on Balancer, that serves as the main source of liquidity for swETH. Swell is looking to expand the availability and liquidity of its LST, starting with swETH, through Balancer. Ahead of and after the Ethereum Shapella upgrade, liquidity and yield on LSTs will be a key competing factor as LST protocols seek integrations and a broader base of holders. Swell is committed to driving value to the veBAL ecosystem by incentivizing pool liquidity via Hidden Hand voting incentives. Deeper liquidity should lead to increased volume and revenue accrual.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Governance will be carried out on the Swell DAO Forum. https://forum.swellnetwork.io/  

2. **Oracles:** 
- Direct Balance Query: The swETH token has an internal  getRate() function (rate provider) that calls swETH’s own wETHToETHRate() function. See the contract here [Contract Link](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf951E335afb289353dc249e82926178EaC7DEd78).  For this reason the token address can be specified as the rate provider.
- Chainlink PoR

3. **Audits:** https://github.com/SwellNetwork/v3-core-public/blob/master/Audit%20Reports/Sigma_Prime_Swell_Network_Security_Assessment_Report_v2_0.pdf

4. **Centralization vectors:** Based on current design, repricing and deposits are done through a centralised bot run by the foundation. Repricing requires off-chain information to be published to the contract. It is not possible to allow others access to this at this time as they could publish incorrect information leading to incorrect repricing rates which could have the primary effect of allowing an attacker to mint an excess of swETH. The foundation has a path to getting all data needed fully on-chain/decentralised through Chainlink, however this will take some time.

5. **Market History:** swETH has just launched so there is not much market history and balancer will be the first pool supporting swETH
 
6. **Value:** Swells swETH-bb-a-WETH pool will be the main source of liquidity for swETH holders. We have chosen to go with a balancer boosted pool to make our pool 100% yield bearing which will both benefit Balancer LPers and Balancer through increased fees once we transition to a core pool.

71,"#### ABSTRACT

This AIP provides for $165,000 USD (which includes a 10% contingency) to fund a marketing initiative to increase awareness of Ape Coin.

Imagine cheering for the ApeCoin sponsored race car in a nationally televised race! I want to bring ApeCoin to the NASCAR racing community. This can be accomplished in February 2023 during the most visible week of racing — at the World Center of Racing, Daytona International Speedway. We will involve the ApeCoin community by holding a contest to custom design a fully digital ApeCoin vinyl wrap for the 200 mph race car! That’s right, the ApeCoin community will design the look of the race car! The winner (and companion) will receive airfare, accommodations, Pit Road Patio Suite credentials to the race (The Lucas Oil 200) and infield/garage credentials to meet the team and the ApeCoin race car prior to the race. ALL members that vote for this initiative will be eligible to join us at Daytona and watch the race from the Pit Road Patio Suite (thats right behind the race teams on pit road)! We will have a random drawing for up to 35 members to join us and support the ApeCoin race car! The goal of this funding is to increase awareness and adoption of ApeCoin.

#### OVERALL COST

Total cost will be $165,000 USD (which includes a 10% contingency). This includes: all transportation, testing and racing costs, digital vinyl wrap, fan base marketing outreach at the track, marketing personnel, giveaways, Pit Road Patio Suite for the ApeCoin community, ApeCoin display race car and operation costs.

## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. In addition, we propose freezing the KNCL reserve.


## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.


## Specification

The recent market downturn on the weekend of December 4th led to the most liquidations on both centralized exchanges and in liquidity protocols in the recent past. Most liquidations on the Aave protocol happened between 4:30 and 5:45 UTC when the price of ETH dropped nearly 13%. Below is a graph of liquidation by collateral and repay asset.
![Liquidations by collateral and repay asset](https://i.imgur.com/gDTtU13.png)
Although volatility for assets is slightly higher, the abundance of liquidity and active market participants is a positive sign for the health of Aave! For example, the total value of CRV (curve dao token) liquidated was large compared to the total collateral used on Aave. Lower LTV, lower liquidation threshold, and higher liquidation bonus protect the protocol from insolvencies. However, multiple liquidations of over 400,000 USD occured in quick succession. This shows ample liquidity for liquidators even in times of high network congestion. These market events provide important data points for measuring tail risk.

For reference, previous analysis of liquidations on Aave from May 2021 can be found here: https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/aave-protocol-liquidation-retrospective-may-2021-67c655fc1b31

Although some assets currently have higher volatility, our analysis shows that it is safe to increase borrowing parameters and decrease liquidation bonus values. Our simulations study price drops and network congestion more extreme than was seen last week, and slippage and liquidity considerations have improved.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAT Loan To Value     | 70%     | 75%     |
| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |
| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |
| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 60%     |
| REN Liquidation Threshold     | 60%     | 65%     |
| SNX Loan To Value    | 30%     | 40%     |
| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 55%     | 60%     |
| SUSHI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |
| ZRX Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |

**Freezing KNCL**
The KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://www.notion.so/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://www.notion.so/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.

Considering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.

74,"#### ABSTRACT

*tl;dr - After overwhelming support and some feedback to improve, Bored Brewing wants to be the first AIP to give equity back to the DAO.*

We want to spread the word of ApeCoin by integrating $APE into the packaging of our beer and through explosive growth of our Made By Apes launch partner brand. This will include creating an $APE coin beer, QR codes on all cans and gamified educational content about the DAO and $APE, Web3 Gaming partnerships & sponsorships, and building out Distribution in Canada, USA, Europe and Asia, as well as a Bored Brewing Clubhouse/Taproom IRL and in The OTHERSIDE. You may even recognize us from Apefest as we were able to source production and manufacture beer that was provided to attendees at this year's Apefest in Hong Kong!

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

1. We will work with the DAO and legal to give back 2% of equity to the DAO. This first of it’s kind give back will usher in the next wave of AIP’s and set the stage for true value creation within the DAO amplified by the marketing impact through branding, education and culture driven social content and sharing. By taking this on, Bored Brewing will lay the difficult, but exciting groundwork for giving back to the DAO.

2. We will be spreading knowledge about $APE coin to less crypto native people who enjoy drinking beer. We believe that $APE can become a currency for the digital revolution and we want to be a small part of spreading the name to a demographic thirsty for this type of knowledge outside of the crypto community.

3. We will sponsor partnered events and share the $APE coin brand across other relevant crypto/nft communities. The goal is to market the coin and share the background and goals of the DAO for the future.

After the vote against AIP-4&5, the community had meaningful discussions on the ApeCoin DAO forum and elsewhere. The essential feedback was that overall the framework was fine, but lacked the key element of caps.

This AIP proposes a staking system for ApeCoin and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT ecosystem: Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC). Staking participants will be able to stake ApeCoin and use the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem NFTs to receive ApeCoin from a preset pool over a set period of time.

There is currently a gap between the NFT/creative/community crowd & and the developer, builder & investor crowd within the crypto community.

A dedicated section for ApeCoin holders and lurkers within Cryptoevents.xyz will promote ApeCoin-related events and bring an understanding of the different ApeCoin initiatives.

This AIP provides for $20,000 in APE to build a custom ApeCoin events sheet within Cryptoevents.xyz, ApeCoin logo display based on RSVP’d ApeCoin holders. The custom designed ApeCoin section will help the ApeCoin community increase reach beyond “the NFT crowd” to other audiences within crypto. This initiative will further ApeCoin’s visibility and relevance within the broader web3 ecosystem.

Success will be measured by the volume of ApeCoin related events and traffic cryptoevents.xyz brings back to the ApeCoin community.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The implementation of ApeCoin Events Hub on Cryptoevents.xyz offers a number of benefits to the ApeCoin Ecosystem:
* Exposure to a brand new crypto audience: By integrating with an existing web3 platform with an existing audience, ApeCoin events will be more exposed to newcomers and more likely to gain meaningful adoption. After all, cryptoevents.xyz website visitors are crypto native, which makes them the perfect ApeCoin target audience
* Increased engagement with existing members: ApeCoin holders will have a centralized hub to discover, participate in, or host ApeCoin events that advance web3 culture.
* Easy discovery for non-holders, who will be able to access this page and learn more about ApeCoin and its initiatives. It is critical such a page is not token-gated and easy to access in order to increase ApeCoin’s reach.
* The ApeCoin logo will be automatically be displayed on all major events where at least one ApeCoin holder is present, further providing an ongoing reminder that ApeCoin is an important participant not just in DAOs & NFTs, but also in the web3 builder ecosystem, attracting new collaborations and investors.
* Encourage more collaboration between various segments of the web3 economy. By furthering the exposure of the ApeCoin community to a broader and more diverse crypto audience, this proposal will also indirectly help other ApeCoin initiatives, like the ETHGlobal sponsorships. For many crypto developers, cryptoevents.xyz is the best source of information on upcoming ETHGlobal hackathons. Through this partnership, ApeCoin’s participation will be further highlighted.
* Accurate insights on who ApeCoin holders are and thus how to best serve them, because Cryptoevents.xyz allows attendees to RSVP to events with their Twitter socials

##### OVERALL COST 
In summary, the creation of a dedicated events page for ApeCoin holders on cryptoevents.xyz, as well as the prominent display of the ApeCoinDAO logo as a company attending main events will benefit the ApeCoin community by enhancing visibility, fostering engagement, and promoting cross-community collaboration within the web3 ecosystem. 

We respectfully request a grant of $20,000 from the ApeCoin community to support this initiative, which aligns seamlessly with ApeCoin’s mission and values.

https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/518

gm! Excited to be making our first proposal on behalf of the Squid and Axelar Community.

## Motivation

BAL is currently bridged to Base via the native bridge, which works very well for transfers to Base, but poorly for transfers away from Base, due to the 7 day waiting period. An alternative method for bridging is needed for user experience and arbitrage. Squid was the first bridge off of Base and has serviced the Base community since, servicing $86 million in [volume since base launch](https://axelarscan.io/interchain?chain=base).

Base is one of the most promising ecosystems in crypto, and Balancer is cementing a strong position, with a series of gauges starting next week.

## Proposal

Squid and Axelar would like to join the Balancer ecosystem through creation of an axlBAL/BAL pool, seeded with 20k BAL of POL, to allow fast bridging of BAL off of Base via Squid. Squid does not have its own DEX mechanism or contracts, so all BAL volume on Squid will be driven through Balancer pools before and after bridging, generating fees for the network. By utilizing Axelar’s General Message Passing, Squid is able to achieve swaps between any token on any chain in one click.

This proposal also intends to activate a [gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x67313e858fB87Cc4b30AD56b6B461D7450738950) on the [axlBAL/BAL pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/base/pool/0x58f2110b61f97fd6b9200b038d92f17c722a5a3300000000000000000000004f) on Base, and the [gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x66E9A9d0a35C6a368A66A432AbD9dB4Fb248f212#code) for the [pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x3f09c77b19ad8bb527355ec32d5ce98421fec2e30000000000000000000004b2) on Arbitrum as it will act as a core piece of infrastructure for the network.

As an Arbitrage path, we think it would be valuable to set up an axlBAL/BAL pool on Arbitrum as well, with 20k BAL total liquidity. This pool will allow arbitrage of the Base pool at tighter spreads due to the lower fees on Arbitrum. Squid recommends this, but it is an optional and up to the Balancer community.

## About Axelar

Axelar delivers secure interchain communication. That means dApp users can interact with any asset, any application, on any chain, with one click. You can think of it as Stripe for Web3. Developers interact with a simple API atop a permissionless network that routes messages and ensures network security via proof-of-stake consensus.

Axelar was one of the only two protocols selected for use in Uniswap’s cross-chain roadmap https://uniswap.notion.site/Bridge-Assessment-Report-0c8477afadce425abac9c0bd175ca382

## About Squid

Squid is a secure cross-chain router on Axelar Network that enables interoperability between blockchains and applications. Squid is easily integrated via their API, SDK, and front-end tools that facilitate fast and reliable single-click transactions and token transfers. Developers can use Squid to onboard users from any ecosystem and create scalable, seamless user experiences for anyone with a crypto wallet.

## Specification

Part A:

The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with  `0x67313e858fB87Cc4b30AD56b6B461D7450738950` for the gauge(address) argument, and `Base` the gaugeType(string).

This will also be done for the Arbitrum pool: 

The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with  `0x66E9A9d0a35C6a368A66A432AbD9dB4Fb248f212` for the gauge(address) argument, and `Arbitrum` the gaugeType(string).

Part B:

If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `transfer` on the BAL token `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` to send 40,000 BAL to the liquidity mining multisig 
recipient: `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`
amount: `40000000000000000000000`

Part C: 

From there, the Maxis will bridge 10,000 BAL and 10,000 axlBAL to each Base and Arbitrum networks, then supply the liquidity to axlBAL/BAL pools. The pool tokens will be sent to the DAO Multisig on each respective network, and not staked in gauges. The transactions for these steps will be posted in an edited post or comment after execution, assuming this BIP passes a snapshot vote.

Bridging BAL to axlBAL on Base or Arbitrum can be done via the Squid interface at https://app.squidrouter.com and selecting Ethereum BAL as source token, and Arbtitrum or Base axlBAL as destination token. Execution can be done via Squid’s integration with Gnosis Safe’s front end, under the “Apps” section (search for “Squid”).",neutral

## Title: [ARFC] OP Risk Parameters Update for Aave V3 Optimism Pool

## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative

## Date: 2023-08-25

---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the activation of OP as a borrowable asset in the Aave V3 Optimism pool. The aim is to adapt to the maturity of the L2 and attract more suppliers and borrowers, thereby generating new revenue for the protocol.

## Motivation

The Aave OP V3 market is one of the Aave V3 L2 deployments, with OP being the native asset of the OP L2. At its inception, the L2 was in its early stages, leading to the onboarding of OP with conservative parameters due to nascent liquidity & infrastructure. 

As the L2 has matured, the ACI proposes less conservative parameters for the OP asset. By removing the isolation mode for OP and allowing its borrowing, we anticipate attracting more suppliers who can earn a yield on their OP deposits and new borrowers who can use OP to borrow additional assets. This will also generate new revenue for the protocol. 

While the proposed changes are less conservative, they still maintain strict supply, borrow caps, and a conservative interest rate strategy. This ensures that the DAO promotes growth and new opportunities while remaining risk-averse. Based on the collected market data post-implementation, the community will have the opportunity to revisit these parameters at a later stage.

## Specification

- **Asset**: OP
- **OP Contract Address**: [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042)
- **Proposed Interest Rate Strategy Address**: [0x3B57B081dA6Af5e2759A57bD3211932Cb6176997](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3B57B081dA6Af5e2759A57bD3211932Cb6176997)

**New Risk Parameters**:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Asset | OP |
| Supply Cap | 10M |
| Borrow Cap | 500k |
| Loan To Value (LTV) | 30% |
| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 40% |
| Liquidation Penalty (LP) | 10% |
| Liquidation Protocol Fee (LPF) | 10% |
| Stable Borrow | Disabled |
| Base Variable Rate | 0% |
| Slope1 | 7% |
| Slope2 | 300% |
| Optimal Ratio | 45% |
| Reserve Factor (RF) | 20% |

## Next Steps

1. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

85,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Range Protocol’s Integration to Position Manager on BNB Chain & Ethereum!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re excited to announce an extension of CAKE rewards for Range Protocol on BNB Chain & Ethereum.


Range Protocol is a liquidity management protocol that helps users manage their assets, optimize their earnings, and reduce the effort needed for managing positions. 


Depending on their preferences, users can deposit their tokens into Range Protocol’s vaults with three different strategies. Range Protocol’s smart contracts will then manage the liquidity positions on PancakeSwap’s v3 AMM based on the strategy selected to earn CAKE and LP rewards.

Range Protocol’s three strategies are: 
- **Pegged:** creates LP positions in a very narrow range around the current price
- **Active Strategy** creates LP positions in a narrow range around the current price
- **Passive Strategy**  creates LP positions in a wide range around the current price
Learn more about them [**here**](https://range-protocol.gitbook.io/range-protocol/amm-vaults/strategy-details).

#### Range Protocol’s Vaults & Liquidity Pools:

Deposit tokens into Range Protocol’s Vaults to earn additional CAKE rewards on top of LP rewards.


CAKE rewards will be distributed with the following criteria:
- **Distribution duration:** 14 days
- **Total tokens:** 1300 CAKE 
- **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 1 Dec 2023
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 15 Dec 2023

The incentives will be distributed in the following vaults on BNB Chain:
- **USDT-WBNB (0.05%) Passive:** 300 CAKE incentives,
- **USDT-WBNB (0.05%) Active:**  100 CAKE incentives,
- **USDT-USDC (0.01%) Pegged:** 200 CAKE incentives, 
- **CAKE-WBNB (0.25%) Passive:** 200 CAKE incentives.

The incentives will be distributed in the following vaults on Ethereum:
- **rETH-WETH (0.05%) Pegged:** 300 CAKE incentives,
- **USDT-USDC (0.01%) Pegged:** 100 CAKE incentives,
- **WETH-USDT (0.05%) Passive:** 100 CAKE incentives. 

The CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from Range Protocol’s vaults will encourage deeper LP liquidity, and ultimately leading to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

| Image taken from our [**tokenomics page**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics) |

Before the Finish Time of 1200 UTC on 15 Dec 2023, we will evaluate the performance of the vaults, and if appropriate, determine whether further incentivization would benefit CAKE holders.

**Summary**:

Back when Aura launched, a portion of the supply was allocated to the Balancer DAO.  That vested Aura exists in the following vesting contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422#code
We are proposing to lock the 1.4m aura that has been vested. 

**Motivation**:

At the time of writing, 1.4m Aura has vested with 600k Aura left unvested. We are proposing to lock this into vlAura to begin earning rewards and eventually start allocating vote weight towards revenue generating or strategically important pools that lack a proper means of bootstrapping without ecosystem stakeholders voting philanthropically.  A proposal for how the DAO will deal with allocating this vlAura voting power will be presented in the coming weeks, but we think it is prudent to initiate the locking now. 

**Specification**: 

The DAO multisig on mainnet 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will call the claim() function on the AuraVestedEscrow at 0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422 with the parameter _lock set to true.",bearish

**Protocol Description:**

Manifold Finance enables and provides access to high-value transaction pools on EVM compatible chains, through our infrastructure: *SecureRPC* . They aggregate multiple endpoints along with maintaining direct access to disparate mining pools/validator nodes (Flashbots, Eden, Miners).

**Motivation:**

Current onchain liquidity is sitting at only 300k while generating in the past few days over 4m$ in volume incentives & bribes to deepen liquidity at this stage of growth is key for Manifold.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** 

Governance utilizes an architecture of elected dictator. By staking FOLD tokens, you delegate protocol control to one address (the dictator). The dictator offers a tribute (rewards) for your support. Accounts that are participating in the dictator regime may elect to vote for a new supreme dictator (operator/management for the protocol) by removing their support and reallocating it towards a new address.  
Source : https://github.com/manifoldfinance/majordomo

A known attack vector involving sandwich staking is mitigated by manually disbursing tributes. This attack vector will be mitigated by a time-dependent withdrawal period in our V2 Vault upgrade. 

> Note that this attack vector has never been actually realized, as it was caught beforehand

Protocol Fees are immediately collected in a vault which then distributes it over time (the time withdrawal is to prevent MEV attacks against the protocol in which accounts enter/exit during certain periods of time). 

A Multisig address is available. The multisig only holds tokens for the purposes of voting in governance proposals of other DAO's. This will be migrated to a vault-based permissive action list structure in which the tokens are held in-vault, with certain permissions enabled for the operator address only. 

2. **Oracles:** 

Not Applicable. 

3. **Audits:**  

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/pki#security-bug-handling-process

https://www.manifoldfinance.com/.well-known/security.txt

Additionally they maintain the DeFi Threat Matrix which is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations on decentralized finance

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/defi-threat/security/advisories?state=published



4. **Centralization vectors:** 

They utilize a concept of Permissive Action List to enable a two-step ownership process for any partner integrations. 

Centralization risks include but are not limited to:

GitHub - we perform off site backups and coordination in the event of GitHub deleting the manifoldfinance org (see LMDBX event for an example).

Google Services: We utilize a domain name not administered by Google for internal services such as user registration, etc. This is not the manifoldfinance.com email address.

Governance Discussions occur on a centralized service, Discourse. [see forums.manifoldfinance.com](https://forums.manifoldfinance.com)

There are also certain account addresses with a large amount of FOLD tokens. However we feel that due to the 'unique' governance regime that this is not in practice a risk factor as it would normally be under traditional DAO governance structures. 

5. **Market History:** 

Pool has been activated in the past 14 days and saw over 225k volume since inception on approximately 84k$ BPT with a current APR of 256% & fees of 1200$ in the past 24h.

Gauge : 0xAf3c3dab54ca15068D09C67D128344916e177cA9

6. **Value:** 

Current pool on Sushiswap is where the majority of LP are with only 3% APY emissions we can't guarantee or force people to move over but with theses BAL rewards and potential bribes it should be a no-brainer :)",bullish
90,"This proposal is to request 166,000 $JUNO ($250,000) from the community pool to be added with 835,000 $WYND ($250,000) minted by the WYND DAO into the JUNO/WYND pool on WYND DEX as Protocol Owned Liquidity.

You can read more about what is POL and WYND DEX here

https://dex.wynddao.com/ https://medium.com/wynddao/wynnovation-protocol-owned-liquidity-78fbbadac86f 

Participation in Protocol Owned Liquidity can be withdrawn at any time for any reason by either party.
Modification of existing parameters, such as adding, partially removing liquidity, or adding / modifying the bondend amount or duration will also require an on-chain governance vote by both parties.
Plan of action
Community pool tokens from Juno and WYND DAO will be sent to a Juno/WYND PoL multi-sig address that will then allocate token to the liquidity pools. This subDAO will also maintain custody of the LP position unless a governance proposal from either Juno or WYND dictates otherwise.

Any excess $WYND goes to the WYND DAO community pool. This means in effect that each side contributes a maximum number of tokens as given in the proposal, but the swap is performed at market price at time of LPing, so the token with better price action will receive some of the tokens back

Multisig members are

Note
Protocol Owned Liquidity is a novel concept that has yet to be successfully implemented in the Cosmos Ecosystem. If this proposal passes, Juno will be the home of the first ever protocol owned liquidity governed by a DAO. The successful implementation of Protocol Owned Liquidity with the Juno Community pool will pave the way to attract more interchain liquidity to Juno Network and WYND DEX.

Voting:

YES - You agree to provide 166,000 $JUNO from the community pool to participate in protocol owned liquidity on WYND DEX
NO - You don’t agree to provide 166,000 $JUNO from the community pool to participate in protocol owned liquidity on WYND DEX

## Motivation

Following up on our [previous recommendations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-recommendation-to-lower-stmatic-maticx-non-emode-lt/14859) on lowering stMATIC / MaticX non-emode LT, these recommendations are geared towards the following:

- Risks associated with increased stablecoin borrowing against LST collateral, amidst lower MATIC LST liquidity
- Lower risks of reduced WMATIC supply in the future, which may cause long-term growth risk for Polygon v3
- Encourage WMATIC borrowing against MATIC LST collateral


## Specification

**stMATIC / MaticX non-emode LT / LTV on Polygon v3**
- Option 1
    - Decrease stMATIC LT from 60% to 50%
    - Decrease MaticX LT from 62% to 50%
- Option 2
    - Decrease stMATIC LT from 60% to 56%
    - Decrease MaticX LT from 62% to 58%

Brand New Vision, a digital fashion ecosystem builder, has recently launched a dapp named ME:ID ([id.bnv.me](http://id.bnv.me/)). BNV aims to bring Web3 self-expression at its highest form to the Apecoin ecosystem.

All Apecoin holders will get access to a range of Apecoin gated digital wearables and accessories branded by IPs owned by Yuga Labs in ME:ID which they can use to create personal real time 3D avatars (see example: [001 | ME:ID – Style looks and create your 3D profile](https://id.bnv.me/001)) and enter the Fashion Battle Royale powered by Apecoin.

![Sample Collection based on Apecoin Branding](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/a/acd72c5eddc5b888894db0d1b50f2caad52056b0_2_1380x776.jpeg)

Prize money in Apecoin will be available to attract audiences outside of the ecosystem to encourage them to Ape in. For those who already have strong connections with their digital avatars, this will be a huge opportunity for their digital alter-egos to be seen at a fashion week event in Paris in early 2024.

BNV has previously executed fashion events, activations, catwalk shows and parties during multiple Paris, London and Copenhagen Fashion Weeks.

![WEINSANTO PHOTOCALL5609](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/b/b6dd49e68ecb40d0fe8c2d4c6d6985fa12fbd06d_2_800x1000.jpeg)

We believe this will put the spotlight on the fashion relevance of the family of IPs of the Apecoin ecosystem like never before.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

Fashion and culture are 2 sides of the same coin, Apecoin’s mission is to promote all things culture in Web3 and ME:ID is all about visualising culture through the lens of fashion. ME:ID aggregates a wide range of culture in the form of fashion, art, music, dance, sports, memes and anything that helps one express his/her/their primal instincts and visual identities. BNV is confident a well executed competition in the form of battle royale with large bottom up exposure on social media platforms can definitely help further Apecoin DAO’s mission.

This collaboration can attract a wide range of fashion forward hypebeasts and digital-native creators from outside the Apecoin Community to interact and create ME:IDs with a wide range of NFT assets and visual creativity that they possess to inject new energy and new vibes into the Apecoin Ecosystem as well as massively promoting Apecoin ecosystem IPs by taking full advantage of algorithm based social platforms such as Tiktok and IG Reels.

#### OVERALL COST

25,000 $APE to fund the prize pool for the top 3 winning ME:ID profiles

$70,000 USD equivalent in $Ape for organising the IRL fashion event in Paris showing off the ME:IDs of the top 8 finalists of the Fashion Battle Royale as well as notable ME:ID avatars from the entire competition.

Chaos Labs proposes to renew our engagement with the Aave DAO, providing our full suite of risk management products and services, covering all of Aave, including V2, V3, and GHO, across all current and future deployments.

Our current annual engagement is set to end on November 7th, 2023.

# Background

In November 2022, Chaos formally joined the Aave DAO as a service provider specializing in risk management and parameter optimization. This partnership began with our original [engagement to cover V3 markets](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025), followed by an [extension to cover V2 markets formally](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/139/), with an additional [engagement amendment](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-scope-and-compensation-amendment/14407) approved by the community in August 2023 to adjust the scope and compensation for the remainder of the original term. 

During this time, we have consistently demonstrated our unwavering dedication to the DAO, covering all aspects of the protocol across all deployments and providing the community with proactive risk parameter recommendations alongside reactive analyses and risk-mitigating strategies in light of significant market events. Chaos has initiated over 60 ARFCs and supported nearly 100 additional proposals and community discussions, including parameter optimization, onboarding of new assets and new deployments, deprecation of V2 and migration to V3, GHO launch, and community support during major market events.

During our engagement, the protocol incurred minimal bad debt while facing major market events, namely the USDC depeg in early March 2023. 

💡 A full overview of Chaos Labs’ activities through the past year can be found in our monthly community updates [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-monthly-community-update/11174/6).

# Proposal

Chaos Labs offers our comprehensive risk management and optimization platform for Aave, covering the entire spectrum of Aave, including V2, V3, and GHO, across all current and future deployments.

Our strategies aim to secure protocol assets against market volatility, black swan events, liquidity attacks, and market manipulation. Our methodologies are rooted in an integrative approach, offering protocol robustness and protecting funds from market risks through dynamic risk parameter recommendations. We provide a holistic approach encompassing software and services to mitigate risks in volatile markets, countering economic attacks on the protocol and ensuring the secure preservation of user funds.

## Scope

### **Risk Parameter Optimization**

Deploying our custom agent-based simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a distinguished team of data scientists and researchers, we provide the community with comprehensive analyses and recommendations for risk parameter settings and strategies. Our paramount goal is to optimize protocol revenue while protecting user funds and mitigating potential risk vectors. Chaos Labs will thoroughly analyze the ecosystem and build custom agent-based simulations. These simulations leverage protocol dynamics and on-chain behaviors to pressure test and optimize the protocol, identifying potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement. Thorough system analysis yields a comprehensive understanding of the factors that impact protocol health and stability, enabling us to make data-driven optimization and risk management recommendations. 

Coverage includes support for all Aave risk parameters, including Liquidation Thresholds, LTV, Liquidation Bonus, Supply and Borrow Caps, Debt Ceilings, and Interest Rate Curves.

**Parameter Recommendation Platform**

The Chaos Labs Parameter Recommendation Portal is designed to provide the Aave community with a comprehensive understanding of the simulation outputs and underlying data to optimize risk parameter settings. By providing a clear and intuitive interface that highlights the impact of different parameter settings on risk and return, we can foster a more informed and engaged community, facilitating ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing. 

In addition to presenting the data outputs from the Chaos Simulation Engine, the Parameter Recommendation Portal offers users unparalleled access to the underlying simulation mechanics and implications, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the simulations and their results.

### **Risk Monitoring and Alerting**

We offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations. Users can drill into specific scenarios in which the protocol could be negatively impacted and receive alerts concerning significant changes to on-chain activities that could pose a risk or detriment to the protocol's health. 

As part of our commitment to delivering a world-class risk management solution for the DeFi ecosystem, we constantly iterate and improve on the platform with additional features and enhancements. The Aave community will continue to gain access to the newest feature additions and enhancements continuously, allowing users to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions while optimizing their overall portfolio performance.

### Deprecation of V2 and Migration to V3

Chaos Labs has spearheaded several community initiatives to deprecate the V2 markets and facilitate the transition to V3, as outlined in the 'Background' section. 

As we progress with the deprecation plan and migration efforts, we are committed to continue allocating resources and offering the community recommendations for proactively adjusting V2 parameters. This includes updates to Liquidation Thresholds, Reserve Factors and enhancing the capital efficiency of V3 markets to ensure a seamless migration of positions from V2. 

Given the extended nature of the transition to V3, it remains imperative to uphold proactive risk management for V2 during this transitional phase.

### **Protocol Growth**

Chaos Labs will provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.

As we onboard new assets and deployments, the Chaos team will seamlessly integrate them into our systems to facilitate continuous monitoring and parameter optimization. We uphold the same high standard for all assets and deployments, ensuring consistency and excellence across the board. Our goal is to provide unwavering support for the protocol's expansion and sustainability.

### GHO

Following the initial launch of GHO, Chaos Labs is committed to the continued growth and safety of the stablecoin and will provide ongoing support, including:

- **Parameter Optimization** - we will conduct data-driven research and simulations to recommend optimizations for GHO-specific parameters, including Borrow rate, stkAAVE discount rate, bucket capacities, GSM, and DEX liquidity goals. Additionally, Chaos Labs will extend its current V3 Ethereum Asset Listing framework to include rigorous analysis of how new asset types can affect GHO composition and stability.
- **Ongoing Risk Management, Monitoring, and Analytics -** We will continue iterations on our unified risk monitoring and alerting platform for GHO across primary markets (Aave), including all facilitators and secondary markets (centralized and decentralized exchanges). Our risk management services include economic reviews of GHO and ecosystem adoption across primary and secondary markets, peg stability, GHO backing composition, and more.
- **Facilitator's Risk Framework, Recommendations, and Monitoring** - we will create a risk framework to consider potential facilitators and their corresponding GHO credit lines and provide ongoing risk analysis for potential and existing facilitators based on this framework.
- **And more**

### Chaos Team Support

As part of our services, we assign a dedicated protocol manager supported by our world-class team of researchers and data scientists to lead all risk-related communications and inquiries with the Aave community.

Our team support typically covers two main areas: ongoing management and incident response. In the event of any incidents or issues, our team will be on hand to provide timely and effective incident response, minimizing the potential impact on the protocol and its users.

**Ongoing and Proactive Risk Management**

This includes detailed analyses of new asset onboarding, assessing the potential risks and benefits of launching in new markets and providing a thorough understanding of parameter recommendations, including qualitative data and position analysis. 

**Incident Response**

 This includes supporting various events, including liquidity changes, asset depegs, price volatilities, etc. Our team provides ongoing support in these events, including market monitoring and alerting, ad-hoc risk analysis, and recommendations on risk-mitigating actions.

Our team of experts brings a wealth of experience in risk management and data analysis, enabling us to provide the insights and recommendations necessary to navigate even the most challenging market conditions. By working closely with the community, we can provide the support and guidance necessary to promote Aave’s long-term success and sustainability.

## Communications:

- Our team will share our recommendations and analyses through dedicated governance forum discussions, maintaining transparency and facilitating effective communication with the community.
- We commit to providing a monthly update post, highlighting completed work and outlining our future areas of focus.
- We are consistently available for community calls and regularly schedule check-up calls with Aave delegates. These calls primarily focus on addressing risk-related inquiries, offering insights into existing proposals, and gathering general feedback.

## Terms

- 12-month engagement, November 13th 2023-November 13th, 2024
- $1.6M, streamed linearly throughout the engagement.
    - Given community preference, we suggest the full amount to be paid in GHO but are open to any composition of stables/AAVE tokens.

## Specification:

If this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (`0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0`) as the recipient.

In terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 1,600,000 aUSDC or GHO for a 12-month duration.

## Disclaimer:

Chaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and Tashi. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.

This proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.

# Next steps

1. Following community feedback, we are targeting a Snapshot vote on November 1st, 2023.
2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) on November 8th, 2023.

99,"Title: [ARC] Add Support for cbETH
Author: @Fig Lead Governance Contributor at Flipside Crypto, with additional support from @AndrewA, a Protocol Specialist at Coinbase
Created: 10/27/2022

-------------------------------------------------------------

This Snapshot vote  is a temp check to add support for Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) to Aave v3 on Ethereum mainnet, once live. 

v3 offers unique features such as isolation mode, capped supply & borrowing, and e-mode which affords the community more optionality.

If passed, and once v3 is live on Ethereum, this will trigger a formal risk review by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs. Parameters will be set leading up to an AIP based on the findings of the risk managers.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Summary

This is a proposal to add Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) to the Aave protocol on Ethereum mainnet. cbETH is an ERC-20 compliant token on Ethereum that represents underlying staked ETH on the Coinbase platform.

Motivation

cbETH is a liquid staking token for ETH created by Coinbase with a goal of facilitating a more competitive liquid-staked ETH landscape.

There is a meaningful amount of demand for borrowing against liquid-staked ETH. Liquid-staked assets (such as cbETH) make for efficient collateral with underlying margins typically improving over time.

Specifications

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

@Fig is a Governance Contributor at Flipside Crypto, a leading delegate on Maker, Aave, Optimism, and Hop. Additional support provided by @AndrewA, who is employed by Coinbase. Andrew and Fig also help review grants as part of the Aave Grants DAO.
2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

Coinbase is supporting liquid staking for its ETH stakers with Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH), where the staked asset is Ether (ETH), and the staking provider and token issuer is Coinbase. With cbETH, Coinbase aims to contribute to the broader crypto ecosystem by supporting high-utility wrapped tokens and open sourcing smart contracts.
cbETH follows the cToken model, which allows it to be ERC-20 compliant and easier to integrate with DeFi more broadly. cbETH can be unwrapped for staked ETH plus accrued rewards net of Coinbase staking fees and any network-imposed penalties. Rewards and penalties affecting Coinbase staked ETH change the conversion rate between cbETH and underlying staked ETH.

3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

With maturing volumes, integration of cbETH would allow those that have staked their ETH with Coinbase to borrow against their locked positions while continuing to earn rewards on the underlying staked ETH.
The introduction of cbETH into the Aave ecosystem could bring a new wave of retail users who learn about Aave through Coinbase and holding the cbETH token. Many of these new customers may become regular users of the Aave protocol.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO, is it live? Products, are they live? How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Coinbase, Inc. (Parent company NASDAQ: COIN) is a prominent cryptocurrency trading platform in the United States. As of 6/30/2022, the company and its global affiliates had 103M+ verified users, $96B assets on platform, and offered services in 100+ countries [source 1]. Coinbase is allowing customers who stake ETH to wrap it for an ERC20 utility token called Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (“cbETH”), which is a liquid representation of their staked-ETH.
Coinbase’s mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. In pursuit of this mission, Coinbase builds products to improve access to economic freedom, cbETH being one of these projects.
With ETH staked on Ethereum being illiquid and unstaking not being available until post-Shanghai, liquid staking solutions have been a natural development.

5. How is the asset currently used?

cbETH allows users who have staked with Coinbase to sell or transfer the ownership of their staked ETH. cbETH is currently traded on Uniswap, Curve, and the Coinbase trading platform.

6. Emission schedule

There is no emissions schedule. Customers who have staked ETH with Coinbase can wrap their staked ETH to obtain the cbETH token.

7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

Key roles of the contract:
    1. oracle  - updates the conversion rate for the token. Coinbase controls the oracle's address and updates the ‘exchangeRate’ every 24 hours at 4pm UTC. This update cadence may be changed in the future. 
    2. master Minter - can assign minters and their limits
    3. minter - can mint and burn tokens
    4. pauser - can pause all transfers, mints, and burns for the contract
    5. blacklister - can blacklist an address from transferring, minting, and burning
    6. owner - can assign all roles except the admin’s
    7. admin - can upgrade the contract, and re-assign itself
All privileged keys are controlled by Coinbase using best practices

## Summary

The community would like to ask for your support in listing sAVAX as a collateral asset. sAVAX is the Liquid Staking token from BENQI protocol.

## Motivation

sAVAX is a Liquid Staking token that allows a user to unlock liquidity while participating in securing the Avalanche network. As sAVAX constantly increases in value from network validation reward, listing sAVAX would allow users to unlock liquidity as a collateral for loans and in turn generate revenue to AAVE. Revenue in the form of sAVAX will always grow from the said network validation reward.

sAVAX is the largest Liquid Staking token on Avalanche and has over 3M sAVAX in circulation with deep liquidity in AMMs to support a healthy lending market ecosystem.

## Specifications

#### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
The author of the AIP is a representative of the BENQI team.

#### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
BENQI Liquid Staking solution that allows a user to stake AVAX to receive sAVAX. AVAX that is staked will then be delegated to nodes to run network validation that generates approx 7.20% APR.

sAVAX can be redeemed back for AVAX after a 15 days cooldown period in a 2 days redemption window. If unredeemed, the sAVAX will be restaked into the protocol and continue to secure the network, generating reward and can be unstaked again at any time after.

#### Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
sAVAX is a yield bearing asset as validation reward is accrued and realised upon redemption for AVAX. Using a yield bearing asset as a collateralised asset would increase the interest earned on supplying and reduce the cost of borrowing.

As sAVAX has multiple integrations with Anchor, Kyber, Trader Joe, Ribbon and Platypus, we expect to see sAVAX being borrowed to facilitate some of these use cases for borrowing.

#### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

BENQI started off as the first lending protocol on Avalanche when there were few builders on the network when it first launched in 2020. Identifying a need for a base layer of DeFi primitive, BENQI’s lending protocol was officially launched in 2021.

As DeFi activity on the Avalanche network grew, it was ripe to support another layer of DeFi primitive, Liquid Staking. With over 270m AVAX ($21 bn) staked in the P-chain (platform chain where validating nodes live), there is a great opportunity for users to participate in securing the network and receiving validation rewards and use sAVAX as collateral on AAVE.

#### How is the asset currently used?
There is over 3M AVAX (~ $200M) being staked via BENQI and over $100M of liquidity across AMMs. sAVAX is integrated by protocols such as Anchor, Platypus, Ribbon Finance, More Money, Trade Joe, Kyber and Pangolin.

#### Emission schedule
No emission schedule

#### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?
sAVAX cannot be minted without staking AVAX in the contract. A multisig is currently the owner of the minting contract of BENQI’s core team.

As delegation requires an EOA, sAVAX’s delegating EOA ownership is in the process of being transitioned to a MPC (multi-party computation) model that decentralizes the process of delegating AVAX to nodes.

Number of holders: 4070 holders

## Technical Specifications

sAVAX uses a pool share system in which the token increases in value due to the increasing AVAX balance in the pool. Staked AVAX is withdrawn from the C-chain smart contract and imported into the P-chain for delegation. The withdrawal and delegation process is currently protected in a hardened memory-only runtime environment with no remote access and extremely restricted physical access. AVAX is delegated to reputable validators randomly to ensure reliable performance and validation rewards. When delegations expire, the rewards are added to the pool and redelegated alongside the principal amount to compound rewards.

The architecture is currently transitioning into a distributed, multi-party computational system which ensures that the private key of the off-chain bot is not known to any entity at any time. For transactions to be executed, multiple wardens must be in consensus regarding the transaction validity, and the wardens have to sign the transactions independently using their own keys. Only when all wardens agree and have signed the transactions can the final transaction be constructed for execution.

It is suggested that the AIP only be implemented once the transition is complete.",bullish

## Motivation
> With the Aave v3 linear pool wrappers ready for deployment in the ecosystem various Boosted Aave v3 pools and pairings have started to crop up in the governance forum. In order to streamline the process of transitioning from the old Aave v2 pool and pairings I on behalf of the Maxis am proposing we close the loop by voting to kill the relevant gauges this week thereby permitting 3 more weeks of emissions on the pool gauges listed below. This will give LPs enough time to migrate their positions and new pools to bootstrap themselves in the BIP-19 cycles. As an adder, a new STG/bb-a-USD gauge will be activated with the execution of this proposal, along with the old one added to the kill list. The STG/bb-a-USD pool will be killed but the same information applies as in [BIP-105.](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-105-enable-stg-bb-a-usd-gauge-ethereum/3905) 

We will be coordinating with the various bribe marketplaces to ensure all future voting incentives only go towards the new gauges. The old pools listed below will no longer have core pool status. All of the migrated pools will be restored as “core pools” under BIP-19.

Why?

**This is psychological.**

When people see high APY staking, they are more likely to buy CAKE to stake.

If there are low APY rewards for staking, then they'd rather park their money somewhere else.


**APY adjustment is one area Pancakeswap cannot cut down on.**

We need a bigger community, more people to have their legs dipped into the CAKE economy, to grow the size and reach of this platform. To do this, we should continue attracting more people to put their money down, buy CAKE, and leave it locked in through attractive staking rewards.",neutral

## title: [ARFC] ACI Phase II
author: @marczeller - Aave-chan Initiative
date: 2023-10-17

---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the continuation of the collaboration with the Aave-chan Initiative (ACI) for an additional period of 180 days, with a proposed budget of 375k GHO.

## Motivation

![image|1920x1097, 50%](upload://9xBM448LftJoHXyBmCPgIOHzLd7.jpeg)


The ACI has demonstrated significant value to the Aave ecosystem across multiple fronts. This proposal seeks to extend our collaboration, focusing on three primary axes: Skyward, Growth, and Representation.

### Skyward:

![image|2000x559](upload://22rgZUXRYxc6uOrlNotwo8BiZ6l.png)


Skyward has emerged as a cornerstone of Aave's governance, producing 90 AIPs in 180 days. This averages out to **[one AIP every other day](https://dune.com/alice_rozengarden/aip-creation-in-2023)**, a testament to the relentless dedication and efficiency of the ACI. Beyond numbers, the ACI has fostered a spirit of collaboration within the Aave ecosystem.

We've co-authored proposals with the vast majority of active DAO service providers, recognized delegates and some active community members. Moreover, our doors have always been open to third-party protocols. By actively welcoming and collaborating with them, we've streamlined the governance process, ensuring that Aave remains inclusive and cohesive in its approach.

**What to expect for phase II?**

Continuation & extension of the Skyward services.

### Growth:

![image|2000x1088](upload://qjlOWocj80wUPeSHio06wG9yJBp.jpeg)


The ACI operates under a guiding principle of ""**Continuous incremental improvement.**""

While we acknowledge that we might not be the driving force behind tech breakthroughs like a potential Aave V4 or, recently, the Governance V3 AIP, our daily commitment is unwavering. We aim to make the protocol 1% better every single day, one AIP at a time. It's through these consistent, small steps that we believe Aave can maintain its leadership in the DeFi space.

Our efforts have already borne fruit. The implementation of offboarding plans for assets like BUSD & TUSD stands out. These initiatives not only enhanced protocol safety but also turned a profit, generating close to 1M$ for the DAO. This revenue, in itself, has multiple times repaid the investment made in the ACI. Furthermore, our vigilant oversight of the DAO's finances has ensured efficiency. We've curbed overspending, optimized budgets, and deterred proposals that didn't align with Aave's best interests, saving the DAO a 7-figure amount & ensuring every GHO & DAO $ is well spent.

**What to expect for phase II?**

The ACI will continue to focus on our continuous incremental improvement doctrine, being a driving force in Aave protocol growth and BD.

For Phase II the main focal points will be on Liquid Staking Tokens diversity with the support of onboarding new assets, GHO growth and adoption with support of synergies and the integration of GHO in both onchain protocols, ramps & L2s.

### Representation:

The ACI has actively engaged in both internal and external representation for the Aave DAO.

**Internal Representation**:

Prior to the ACI's involvement, the DAO too often encountered challenges, such as proposals not reaching the required quorum. Governance activity was subdued, and the operations were notably insular. The ACI introduced several key initiatives:

- **Orbit Program**: The ACI allocated ~20% of its budget to the Orbit program, focusing on diversity. This program compensates recognized delegates for their contributions, leading to increased participation rates and improved diversity metrics. The frequency of proposals failing due to a lack of quorum has decreased. With the now DAO-funded Orbit program, **the DAO has enshrined these benefits**
- **Governance Guidelines**: The ACI contributed to the establishment of the Aave DAO governance guidelines. This effort aimed to bring clarity, predictability, and efficiency to DAO governance. The ""**Minimal Viable Bureaucracy**"" ACI Doctrine, ensures a balance between structured governance and accessibility.
- **Support for New Delegates**: The ACI has extended support to emerging delegate platforms, co-authoring proposals and providing guidance. This collaborative approach has enriched the DAO's ecosystem.

**What to Expect from Phase II?**

We will continue contributing to the Aave DAO frameworks and supporting DAO active participants seeking a balance between organization & accessibility.

We will also delegate engineering resources for service providers via mini-dapps such as the recent [acistreamcollector.com](http://acistreamcollector.com), which allows no code claims of DAO streams.

**External Representation**:

![image|1920x1423](upload://o68ggEFjWsJdbQHaC8hqxPvL6sV.jpeg)


Externally, the ACI has been a voice for the Aave DAO in various capacities.

- **Event Participation**: The ACI has participated in and sponsored several global events to share insights and collaborate with industry peers. In 2023, our engagements included:
    - Web3DNA (Paris)
    - EthDubai 2023
    - Prague DeFi Summit/EthPrague
    - Stable Summit (Paris)
    - EthCC[6] (Paris)
    - Dappcon Berlin 2023
    - LëtzStake (Luxembourg)
    - EthLisbon
    - Devconnect Istanbul
    
    A detailed list of our engagements can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/f676c1ce96f44c648ef2a40f7f1bb442?pvs=21).
    
- **Regulatory Engagement**: The ACI's founder holds the position of president of the DeFi committee of the French Lobby ADAN. This role involves dialogues with regulators, institutions, and governments in France and Europe regarding the DeFi sector. The ACI has been involved in discussions related to the ""Mica 2"" regulation, which addresses DeFi services.

The ACI, as one of the voices for the Aave DAO, has consistently worked towards enhancing the DAO's presence and reputation in the broader ecosystem.

**What to Expect from Phase II?**

The ACI will continue to be one of the voices of Aave across the globe, supporting devs in hackathons, being one of the DAO voices during events and supporting our brand quality.

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market 

Author: [@mv_Trident]

Created: 2023-12-18

---

# Summary

This AIP proposes the onboarding of the PYUSD stablecoin, minted by Paxos Trust Company, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.

# Motivation

PYUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin minted through Paxos. While it’s still young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $230M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:

- Build synergies between Aave and PYUSD.
- Offer Aave users an additional stablecoin option.
- Strengthen the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin. (Trident may explore the deployment of a PYUSD/GHO pool)

We propose a PYUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.

If the community deems that PYUSD as collateral is immediately viable we stand ready to support that role on day one; otherwise following PYUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for PYUSD at a later stage.

# Specification

Ticker: PYUSD
Contract address: [0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8])https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8)
Price Feed: [0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1)

Chainlink Oracle: [https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/PYUSD-usd](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/pyusd-usd)

We propose the following parameters for a PYUSD onboarding:

Parameter	Value
Isolation Mode	No
Borrowable	Yes
Collateral Enabled	No
Supply Cap (PYUSD)	25M
Borrow Cap (PYUSD)	20M
Debt Ceiling	N/A
LTV	N/A
LT	N/A
Liquidation Bonus	N/A
Liquidation Protocol Fee	10.00%
Variable Base	0.00%
Variable Slope1	7.00%
Variable Slope2	80.00%
Uoptimal	80.00%
Reserve Factor	10.00%
Stable Borrowing	Disabled
Stable Slope1	13.00%
Stable Slope2	300.00%
Base Stable Rate Offset	3.00%
Stable Rate Excess Offset	8.00%
Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio	20.00%
Flashloanable	No
Siloed Borrowing	No
Borrowed in Isolation	No

*Liquidity and Market Cap*

The PYUSD token was introduced a few months ago, and since its launch, its market cap has increased to approximately $230million. Over the coming weeks the pool will be scaled further with incentives in order to reach the necessary liquidity to support the proposed market parameters.

![PayPal USD Price Chart.png](ipfs://bafkreihqq36bcffddfsnmcz4m4gda4pcopqktjs4rdneanq4q4pggkesfm)
    
When analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at the available historical data. The 30 Day average Market Cap of PYUSD is $170M with a 30 day average volume of $4.7M. Over the last 7 days, the average Market cap has climbed to $209M with the same period seeing an average volume of $8.7M, the volume and aum increase is on the back of prior stakeholder efforts and we expect both to grow meaningfully in the coming weeks.

 
![coming weeks.png](ipfs://bafkreifqcajvizwsxvoiinqyppnncfzmdqk56dirdnwlfolhlwamonktva)
    

With peg holding well since inception, an average intra-day volatility of ~0.01%, and the ability of onboarded institutional investors to redeem PYUSD 1:1 with Paxos, we see low risk related to the stability of PYUSD’s price.

*Initial Supply and Borrow Caps*

PYUSD circulating supply is ~$230M. Given PYUSD is a new asset listing, we recommend adopting a conservative approach for setting supply and borrow caps for PYUSD, which gives room to expand caps should cap usage be elevated. We recommend a supply cap of 25M and a borrow cap of 20M.

*Variable Borrow Rate*

We recommend setting slope 1 to 7% due to current on-chain stable yield opportunities which we believe will remain viable for the foreseeable future.

*Borrowable in Isolation*

We do not see excess risk with enabling PYUSD being borrowable in isolation. If the community wishes to take a more conservative stance, it may wish to only limit PYUSD borrowing to non-isolated collateral.

# Next Steps:

1. Gather community feedback on this TEMP CHECK.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to TEMP CHECK snapshot stage.
3. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.
4. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
5. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage

#Disclosure
@mv_Trident works with [Trident](https://www.tridig.io/) who has been contracted by Paxos in order to improve the on-chain liquidity and utility of its issued assets.
This TEMP CHECK is powered by Skywards.
The Aave Chan Initiative has not received any form of compensation from Trident Team for creating this proposal.

108,"### Service Provider Name & Overview

 The Balancer Maxis are a passionate group of Balancer community contributors. A center of excellence that keeps the Balancer ecosystem operating at a first class level. As the protocol grows, this team's responsibilities will likely grow with it. We have picked up maintenance tasks from other organizations in the Balancer ecosystem as it continues to decentralize and would expect this to continue (see examples below).

### Leader(s)

Solarcurve - joined by Zekraken, Mike B, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, and Danko8383.

**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct (or link to your own)**: Yes

**Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines:** Yes

### Domains of Operation

*Multisig Management*

* Linear (boosted) pool settings
* Swap fee and amplification adjustments
* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL
* Adding new reward tokens to gauges
* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees
* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig

**Expertise:** Besides setting swap fees, this group has done all these tasks from day 1. Soon after we took control of swap fees from our friends at Gauntlet, the protocol broke the previous record of 24h fees earned. We believe our track record justifies our continued management of these multisigs until such time as governance approves another SP to take them over.

*Governance*

* We serve on the [Governance Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp/2324) and ensure continuity of Balancer’s Governance Process
* Active participants in discord and the forum on governance topics
* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)
* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process
* Manage admin of the Governance forum
* We will pursue various strategic initiatives, either individually or as a group, at our discretion such as deploying to Optimism or the new Operating Framework
* In the cases that voting power in other protocols from tokens held in Balancer’s Treasury has been delegated to us, we will represent Balancer’s interest in these votes.

**Expertise:** We helped to design Balancer’s governance system and are very active users of it. It is safe to say our group has the strongest working knowledge of Balancer’s governance system outside of Balancer Labs. For now it does require active management to ensure votes are carried out in an orderly fashion then properly executed. We believe our track record here again speaks for itself and we will continue to operate in the same fashion we have been until governance approves a new governance framework or approves another SP to take these tasks over.

*User/project support*

* We manage Balancer’s discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed
* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions
* We often deploy new pools for other projects
* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists
* We help with UI testing for Balancer

**Expertise:** If you come to discord we’ll likely be the ones helping you out. We are also spread out in many chats with projects offering advice and performing routine necessary tasks as described above. It is safe to say almost all projects that have used Balancer over the last year have spoken to one of us at some point. We will continue to operate in this support capacity and offer any assistance we can to the community and the efforts of other SP’s.

*Community*

* We manage a Coordinape circle open to all DAO contributors
* Onboarding framework for new contributors
* Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO, or between SPs
* Regular health-check on SP and community contributors with recurrent feedback

**Expertise:** These initiatives were pioneered by some of our members over the last six months. We will continue iterating and exploring these both with our in house knowledge but also in collaboration with the broader community.

*Record Keeping*

* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.
* Maintaining, updating, and improving official Balancer documentation as a bridge between the greater community and core development team.

### Key Objectives & Success Metrics

*Multisig Management*

* Transactions are vetted for accuracy and executed in a timely manner
* Public discord channels are used for swap fee discussion so the community can provide input and feedback.

*Governance*

* Balancer’s Governance system continues to operate in a fair and transparent manner.
* We will continue being very active participants and leaders

*User/project support*

* Discord/telegram chat questions will be answered in a timely manner

*Community*

* Coordinape will pay out promptly each month
* We will act as a touch point for any interested contributors to Balancer DAO

*Global*

* We commit to undertake all activities in public where reasonable. We aim to responsibly grow the Balancer Maxis and this can only be done when the community is able to interact and engage with us. There must be more opportunities for this in the future.
* We will continue to facilitate the weekly Treasury meeting (Tuesday 11am EST in discord) open to the public. This is a good opportunity for anyone in the community to talk to us about the Treasury or any other relevant topic.
* We will facilitate a monthly community call where all SP’s are welcome to join for their monthly updates. This eases the burden on the community to attend many calls. Again, optional participation by other SP’s.

### Length of Engagement & Budget:

3 months.

Budget of 6,875 BAL per month for salaries (1,250 per person, Danko at 625) which will be max locked in veBAL by contributors. Additional monthly allocations of 100 BAL for gas costs and 4,000 BAL for Coordinape.

**Total for 3 month engagement:** 32,925 BAL

**Impact on the Treasury**: The Treasury currently holds ~4M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis would cost less than 1% of the treasury’s BAL holdings.

**ETH Address to Receive Funds**: 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325

**Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation):** N/A

*As a final note, if this proposal passes Zen Dragon will be replacing mkflow on the Governance Council as he voluntarily steps away and into other roles in the ecosystem. We thank him for his service. The members of the council will now be Solarcurve, Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, and Zen Dragon.*",bullish

title: Add ENS to Aave V2
status: ARC posted, Snapshot pending
author: 🔥_🔥
shortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for the ENS governance token
discussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-ens-as-collateral/6342/4
created: 2021-11-28
---

# ARC: Add ENS as collateral

## Summary

ENS (Ethereum Name Service) is an critical piece of infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem with over 400,000 names registered and hundreds of intergrations across the ecosystem.

$ENS is the governance token providing ownership over the ENS protocol. $ENS governs the direction of the ENS treasury as well as controlling crucial protocol parameters via the ENS registrar controller.

This proposal looks to onboard $ENS as a collateral asset to Aave. 

## Motivation

Following conversations with Aave and ENS core team members, we've found that ENS is a prime candidate for Aave, already having gathered over $1B in circulating market cap and millions of dollars in liquidity across the ecosystem.

The addition of ENS to Aave lending markets will unlock additional liquidity and optionality for all ENS holders.

## Benefits to Aave Community

ENS is a highly reputable multi-billion dollar protocol with a significant amount of liquidity on Ethereum. The addition of ENS will provide Aave with an increase in bandwidth and utility for the protocol.

In addition, the Aave community should be aligned with the addition of ENS token given a significant amount of the Aave community also hold ENS names (and ENS tokens as a result of the retroactive distribution).

## Specification

Linked in [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-ens-as-collateral/6342/4).

## Proposed Risk Parameters

In addition to the physical and digital activities hub we will offer at ApeCoin DAO Founders Circle, a platform to streamline our operations. This website will allow ApeCoin DAO members (via wallet) to access co-working spaces and participate in events through the use of tags, as well as the founders or guests. With this website, we aim to make it easier for individuals to make the most of our activities and services. The website will also have an education hub where users can access helpful materials, videos, and slides to continue their learning journey at their own pace.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

The ApeCoin DAO Founders Circle holds transformative potential that directly aligns with the objectives of DAO vote AIP-259. This initiative strategically reinforces the proposed impact within selected markets by establishing offices and operational hubs in those markets. The initiative contributes to significant realization in selected markets, elevating brand visibility, onboarding Web2 to Web3, and fostering long-term growth for ApeCoin.

**Selected Market Penetration**

The Founders Circle's approach of opening worldwide offices and operational hubs aligns perfectly with the intention to create significant impact in the selected markets identified by [AIP-259: Language and Market Focus for ApeCoin DAO in 2024-2025](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-259-language-and-market-focus-for-apecoin-dao-in-2024-2025/). This strategic alignment ensures that the ecosystem's presence is not only felt but also deeply integrated into these markets, effectively amplifying our reach and influence.


**Promoting ApeCoin DAO**

The initiative's inclusion of showcasing the ApeCoin DAO logo on buildings in the selected markets further elevates our brand visibility and reputation. By creating localized touchpoints, it introduces the organization's values, technologies, and services to a broader audience, positioning ApeCoin DAO as a leading entity within the metaverse.

**Onboarding Web2 to Web3**

The Founders Circle serves as a bridge for Web2 communities looking to enter the Web3 world. It provides a localized, supportive environment for tech companies and startups to learn about web3, NFTs, and blockchain technology, and our DAO facilitating a smooth transition into the crypto space.

**Long-Term Growth and Expansion**

The multi-year timeline of the Founders Circle’s operations further enhances the lasting impact outlined in AIP-259. By establishing a continuous presence, we can cultivate enduring relationships with local investors, startups, and communities, contributing to the sustained growth and influence sought by the DAO.


#### OVERALL COST

114,"## Intro

Following the developments after the [DNS hack reported here](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/dns-security-incident-post-mortem-1b1feb735aca), and given the precedent set by [BIP-443](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-443-restore-brand-trust-in-balancer-by-assisting-dns-hack-users/5218) and [BIP-455](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-455-assisting-dns-hack-victims/5259), this proposal seeks to refund affected users by the frontend attack with 25% cut.

## Motivation

After refunds of BIP-443 and BIP-455, only 1 (one) user came forward publicly reporting the loss of funds due to the DNS attack. There could potentially be others that might be waiting for the formation of the volunteer committee described on BIP-433 and/or the public announcement of a claiming window.

Given the past refund allocations and known wallets impacted, the expenditure shouldn’t be greater than 34k, even though the program would still have 110.578,95 USDC provisioned. We find it would be better to put this program behind us and therefore suggest using the same deadline in the [[BIP-445] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-445-decide-on-direction-of-restitution-for-affected-lps-in-boosted-pool-incident/5187)regarding the Boosted Pools incident.

## Specification

This proposal will override the specifications on BIP-443, and shall be voted as follows:

1. Affected users will have until Dec 25th, 2023 to post on this thread (or by any means reach out to the Balancer Maxis), being this a final deadline to ask for refunds in a final payment batch coming January.
2. To verify claims, the Balancer Maxis will cross-reference the user’s reported transactions with the [spreadsheet ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nby6q2kyA9PSvrKeMSJtRIFllxzlOHAT96SE38fnGxA/edit#gid=593597477)made public in the incident post-mortem.
3. Users will be asked to verify wallet ownership with a signed message on chain agreeing to the 75% cut and payment in USDC at the time of the attacks (precedent set by BIP-443).
4. Final numbers will be posted in January’24 on a new BIP authorizing payments.

*If passed, this proposal shall be posted by our Marketing team on Discord and Twitter, as well as any interested media outlets, for max comms amplification regarding the deadline.*",neutral

118,"## Simple Summary

This Snapshot vote establishes community consensus on whether:
1. New assets are not required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%, or
2. New assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.


## Motivation


Since Gauntlet began its partnership with the Aave protocol, we have received requests from the Community to analyze asset listings. Community members, developers, and other stakeholders often asked us questions like, ""how much liquidity should this asset have before being listed? What should the asset's initial parameters be? How do we protect the protocol from insolvency?"" 

Gauntlet's framework focuses specifically on market risk and how Gauntlet will support the asset listing process in Aave. Our framework can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/gauntlet/Aave-Asset-Listing-Framework-Market-Risk-7c29d448924f444abfa9681410c707c3). This will work in conjunction with [Aave's existing asset listing framework](https://docs.aave.com/governance/guides/new-asset-listing). 

Listing assets is essential to the growth of the protocol. As new assets in DeFi proliferate and older assets fall out of favor, Aave must list and delist assets to maintain its usefulness as a protocol. Gauntlet will conduct these risk assessments prior to new assets being listed, given 2 weeks of notice and strong community buy-in.

Notably, we recommend that LTV and Liquidation Threshold be set to 0% on the initial listing. In other words, assets will not be allowed to be used as collateral upon their initial listing. 

Historically, the community has listed assets with non-zero LTV and Liquidation Threshold. Because there are risks in doing so, this Snapshot vote helps the community align on best practices moving forward.


## Specification

Community input is valuable because requiring that assets are listed with an initial LTV of 0% imposes important trade-offs:

1. Not requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can potentially allow the asset to have more utility (depending on the asset) from the onset of listing. Thus, the protocol may be earning revenue at the onset of the listing (driven by increased borrows). However, when assets are enabled as collateral from the initial listing, the protocol immediately faces the technical and market risks inherent in adding another risk vector to the protocol. The protocol is only as strong as its weakest link.
2. Requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can protect the protocol from unforeseen mechanism, smart contract, and other technical risks. In addition, setting an initial LTV of 0% allows the protocol to observe how supply and borrow usage as well as liquidity conditions evolve following the asset listing. This data enables more robust risk analysis and fine-tuning of LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters following the initial asset listing. The tradeoff is that until an asset is enabled as collateral, usage may be limited (depending on the asset), and thus, the protocol faces an opportunity cost of revenue. We view this as a minuscule opportunity cost (e.g., a few weeks of revenue attributable to the asset) relative to the risks. Assets can be turned on as collateral, but being turned off as collateral is a more difficult process with increased user friction.


Option 1 above should not be interpreted as suggesting that all assets should be enabled as collateral. It simply allows for the possibility that assets can be listed with an initial non-zero LTV should the community deem the asset a collateral asset.

Should the community favor Option 2, assets should be listed with an initial LTV of 0%, and a separate proposal must be proposed by the community at some point after the initial listing to enable the asset as collateral. At that point in time, given strong community buy-in, Gauntlet will conduct market risk analysis to recommend LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters.

## Next Steps


* This Snapshot vote has the below options:
1. Not all assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.
2. All assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%. After 2-3 weeks of operation as a non-collateral asset, the community can propose turning it on as collateral. At that point, Gauntlet will make parameter recommendations as per our Notion document below.

Title: [ARFC] Deployment of Aave on zkSync
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-10

---

# **Summary**

The current ARFC proposes deploying Aave V3 on zkSync to leverage the scalability and cost-efficiency of zk-Rollups. By integrating with zkSync, Aave can offer users faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum mainnet. This ARFC seeks governance approval for the deployment of an Aave V3 instance on the zkSync Era L2.

## Motivation

zkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that utilizes zk-Rollups to batch multiple transactions off-chain and submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach significantly enhances transaction throughput and reduces gas fees. Deposit and borrowing activities can greatly benefit from the reduced transaction costs and increased throughput offered by zkSync.

### Benefits of deploying to zkSync

1. **Reduce Gas Fees:** By leveraging zkSync’s efficient transaction processing, users will incur significantly lower gas fees.
2. **Scalability:** zkSync’s high throughput will allow Aave to scale effectively, accommodating more users and transactions without compromising performance.
3. **New Frontier & Opportunities:** This deployment will offer the Aave DAO a new frontier for growth to explore and a new avenue path for GHO, our stablecoin.
4. **Interoperability:** Due to zkSync infrastructure, an Aave V3 deployment in the zkSync Era can benefit other Aave family products, such as Lens on a segregated layer with GHO, making it a mutually beneficial relationship.

## Specification

### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments
1. Aave DAO commits to redistribute to Aave users via liquidity mining, GHO secondary liquidity incentives, safety module deployments, or merit programs any airdrop provided by the zkSync ecosystem.
2. ACI, on behalf of the Aave DAO, will coordinate any liquidity mining campaign on a zkSync Aave V3 deployment.

• Twitter: https://twitter.com/KelpDAO

Protocol Description:

rsETH is one of the largest LST-based liquid restaked token on the EigenLayer ecosystem. It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs

Kelp has more than 260,000 ETH worth of assets restaked by over 40,000 users across multiple L2s. All of this is within 4 months of launch

By providing liquidity for the restaked positions, wrsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.

Motivation:

Kelp is seeking to establish the [wrsETH/ETH on Optimism] and on Balancer to further enrich the liquidity of wrsETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Kelp community.

Specifications:

1. Governance: Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon

2. Oracles: Kelp is working with Redstone to create price feeds of rsETH.

3. Audits: Kelp’s smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena.

  1. Sigma Prime Report: https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/SigmaPrime.pdf
  2. Code4rena: [Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-11-kelp)
  3. MixBytes: [KELPDAO LRT-ETH SECURITY AUDIT REPORT](https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/mixbytes.pdf)

4. Centralization vectors: Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.

Our goal is to migrate Kelp away from these vectors.

5. Market History: Kelp has seen meteoric growth in TVL in the last few weeks with TVL over 260k ETH and >40,000 holders of rsETH across mainnet and L2s.

The balancer pools are already live and are available on Optimism

Optimism pool: https://app.balancer.fi/#/optimism/pool/0x73a7fe27fe9545d53924e529acf11f3073841b9e000000000000000000000133

6. Value: The balancer pool is the 2nd liquidity pool on Optimism and is aimed at providing liquidity to the growing community.

123,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes pSTAKE ($PSTAKE) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with pSTAKE! 

Developed by Persistence, pSTAKE is a multi-chain liquid staking protocol that unlocks the liquidity of proof-of-stake assets by issuing staked representative tokens (e.g. stkBNB) against users’ bonded assets, allowing them to earn DeFi yields on top of staking rewards. It is currently live on Cosmos, Ethereum, and BNB Chain.

BNB holders can liquid stake their tokens [**here**](https://bnb.pstake.finance/) to mint stkBNB and further use it in the BNB Chain DeFi ecosystem (eg. on PancakeSwap).

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn PSTAKE tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 950,000 PSTAKE
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1300 UTC on 25 Apr 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1300 UTC on 24 Jun 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.5497 PSTAKE

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the PSTAKE Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a **stkBNB-BNB (0.05% fee tier)** and a **PSTAKE-CAKE (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm on BNB Chain.  


The **stkBNB-BNB (0.05% fee tier)** v3 farm will have 12x CAKE rewards, while the **PSTAKE-CAKE (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm will have 4x CAKE rewards for the entire 60 days . At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1300 UTC on 24 Jun 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $PSTAKE?

PSTAKE is the governance token of pSTAKE Finance – PSTAKE holders can participate in the protocol’s governance and protocol improvement proposals to ensure long term security of the protocol. It is also used to align incentives of all the stakeholders within the pSTAKE ecosystem.

#### What is $stkBNB?

stkBNB is the staked representative of BNB issued by pSTAKE that allows for a more secure BNB Chain and higher BNB DeFi yields. Under the hood, the staked BNB is delegated to a robust set of 10 validators that optimizes for APR without compromising security. pSTAKE only charges 5% of fees for liquid staking your BNB. stkBNB has been audited by Peckshield, Halborn, & Certora. An on-chain monitoring system with Forta, bug-bounty on Immunefi, and stress tests by the BNB Chain team add to a secure liquid staking experience.

125,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

Firstly, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to the Trading Allocation (and therefore farms) – the per block allocation to the Trading Allocation will remain at [**1.93 CAKE/block**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics).

Importantly, the purpose of this proposal is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. 

By boosting APRs for higher-performing farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below. Rewards will be redistributed from farms with reduced multipliers to farms with increased multipliers, along with all other existing farms. This will give us increased capacity to establish Syrup Pool/Farm arrangements with more partner projects.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their farm multiplier, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, etc.

By leveraging social login and seamless FIAT payments, Blever provides easy access to ApeChain not only for experienced users but also for casual players and retail.

In addition to gaming, you also need fun, culture, memes, and PFPs to make ApeChain appealing and popular. Blever is designed to do just that. We see ourselves as an extended community-driven business development arm. We search for projects, support their launch, and bring them tremendous reach and engagement through social farming. Everyone wins!

With $APE being the native gas token of ApeChain we believe that bringing users/traffic/projects to the chain is probably the single most important thing the DAO can focus on in the near future.

**Driving demand for ApeChain = Driving demand for $APE**

Easy access to ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE Incentives on ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE More use cases on ApeChain → more use cases for $APE ApeChain hype → $APE hype

This is our biggest opportunity and we want to do everything we can with Blever to make the most of it.

Having already invested more than 2 months of our time and resources, we are now looking for funding from the DAO to help us achieve our goal. Let’s make ApeChain a success together

128,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-dao-wave-2/2275).

This draft has been created by the committee of the Balancer Grants DAO. See its previous proposal for establishing this committee [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-establish-the-balancer-grants-dao-and-coordinate-the-next-wave-of-balancer-community-grants/2095).

## Summary
This proposal aims to fund the next cycle (Nov 1st - January 31st) of Balancer Grants DAO. The upcoming program will further accelerate the development of the Balancer ecosystem by improving coordination around Grants, RFPs and Ventures.

The requested budget for this next cycle (3 months) is 50,000 BAL. Similar to the first Balancer Grants DAO proposal, a learnings and review end report will be created at the end of the cycle, and any unspent resources will be sent back to the BAL treasury.

The Balancer Grants committee has already worked together during the first 3 month’s cycle. To maintain continuity and support for the grants that are still running, and the applicants that have applied, we want to have the proposal for the next cycle up and ready on time. The first round has been a success and shows the need and the potential for a bigger Balancer Ecosystem. To get a better idea of what has been done, check out our monthly reports on the [Balancer Community Notion](https://balancergrants.notion.site/Grants-Updates-404ae3750a084de78116cb899b17e2b9). An end report for cycle 1 is being finalized and will be published at the end of the current cycle, which is running until the 31st of October.

From the beginning we have looked at this first round as a time of learning and iterating, building on what works and leaving behind what is useless. With this in mind, the committee requested a lower amount than is often given to grant programs within the crypto space. Now that the committee and the Balancer community is aware of these learning points, the following rounds will no doubt go even smoother than this round already went.

## Impact
Looking back on the first cycle, we can say with confidence that the program has been a success. The program has been able to pull in multiple promising and established DeFi projects into the Balancer Ecosystem. To build long term relationships and grow Balancer’s TVL were the main objectives, and the program is clearly delivering. We as a committee have identified multiple opportunities when it comes to ecosystem building and want to act upon these in the next cycle.

Establishing well-aligned yet autonomous units within the Balancer Ecosystem aligns with Balancer’s Decentralization and Ecosystem strategy. Having multiple entities co-develop the Balancer ecosystem creates value-add opportunities and allows the separate entities to specialize further.

## PROPOSAL
We propose some small changes to the current setup of the grants program, and advocate to further the decentralization of the BalancerDAO. We believe this can be done through multiple committees, initially funded by the Balancer Grants DAO. We understand that this is a slow and long process, so this will be a learning experience where we want to plant the seeds for the future.

The grant program provides support and funding ($5K - USD $75K, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem.

The RFP (bounty) program provides rewards for completion of key tasks identified by the Balancer community. It’s the easiest way for anyone to contribute to the Balancer ecosystem. RFPs can be either technical or non-technical and vary in reward size depending on the required skill set and time needed to complete.

The venture program aims to expand the Balancer ecosystem and further align incentives with ecosystem partners through partnership agreements, token swaps and DAO2DAO ventures. We propose to start this off with a Venture Lead role who will be actively building out these types of deals and structures. With the actual outcomes going to the forum and being voted upon by the community. To support this opportunity, it needs some firepower and a dedicated role plus support can bring that.

The end-goal of the complete program is to attract and retain talent and resources to the Balancer ecosystem.

129,"I propose to increase the APR of staking and liquidity providing to reward the active users of Pancakeswap.

With low APRs (and getting lower due to votes) we are not incentivising people to use Pancakeswap directly, if CAKE has little to no emmisions at all why use Pancakeswap? Just hold your CAKE in an exchange, much easier.

I don't think people fully understand the effect of emissions, think of emissions as a company giving stock dividends instead of cash, let's say 4% stock dividend, nothing happens at all, because everybody gets 4% (This is not the case for Pancakeswap since we have burns).

However not all CAKE holders get the best returns. Let's go back to the dividend example, some people get the 4%, some don't, in this scenario the 4% return guy actually gets something because he gets more compared to others. This is a good way to reward people who actually use Pancakeswap.

If CAKE emmisions go to zero, there will be no more staking and rewards for providing liquidity is very low. What do you think will happen to Pancakeswap if that occurs?

Here's another one, people just get excited over high APRs even if it's pure inflation. (to reiterate CAKE is not purely inflationary due to burns).

From what I see most people want CAKE to be deflationary, which is great, but not the best option. If what you want is to get the maximum amount of value, increasing emissions is the best option. If you're reading this you're one of the people going to benefit from higher emissions. 

I'm not proposing to increase the emissions to max immediately, there are people who want the exact opposite of what I'm proposing after all. 

Deflation can still be achieved, what we need to do is focus on deflationary products, instead of trying to force it through lower emissions.

We get more burns if more people use the platform, increasing emissions will get us more users.

Thank you for reading, let's continue to make this a great community.",neutral

133,"Summary
A proposal for continuous market risk management to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses.

Background
Venus’s previous interest rate model 6 and conversations with the Venus team shows the importance protocol stakeholders put towards understanding and mitigating risk. Over the past few years, Gauntlet has deployed our simulation platform to similar lending protocols and we are happy to state Gauntlet’s work has resulted in strengthening protocol structure and we continue to make parameter recommendations to optimize for capital efficiency as well as reduce insolvency risk.

Preventing insolvency is not the only market risk Venus faces. Deflationary spirals and shocks to market prices can’t simply be prevented without reducing the protocol’s utility. Tail-event scenarios are rarely the result of bad actors taking malicious actions against the protocol. The vast majority of Venus’s participants are honest but what’s good for the lender is not always good for the borrower. Depositors lend, borrowers borrow, and liquidators rebalance. This intersection is where Gauntlet comfortably sits, directing traffic per the stated desires of the community.

Gauntlet will onboard and then continuously rerun our simulations for the Venus Protocol, pushing regular changes to ensure optimal risk parameters. We will also deploy our asset listing framework to ensure new assets being proposed for the Venus Protocol meet the market risk standards that the community has set forth.

140,"[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-increase-mkr-captier-from-cap3-to-cap4-10m-30m/233).

**TL:DR**

As outlined in the [new whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the MKR capFactor from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). MKR has exceeded $10m adjusted liquidity for a period of time. MKR bring good liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem.

---

**The Proposal**

This is a proposal to increase the MKR cap Tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). MKR currently has $16M in adjusted liquidity and has probably surpassed it's $10M cap for a month.

MKR brings useful liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem. Before, Uniswap used to be the most popular DEX for trading MKR.

---

**What is MKR?**

MKR is a DeFi large cap, it currently has a $600M market cap. There's currently $1.5B locked in MakerDAO, and 425M DAI has been minted.

SCD (Single Collateral DAI) was launched in December 2017. MCD (Multi Collateral DAI) was launched in November 2019.

MakerDAO is a decentralized credit platform on Ethereum that supports DAI, a stablecoin whose value is pegged to USD. Anyone can use Maker to open a Vault, lock in collateral such as ETH, BAT, or WBTC ... and generate Dai as debt against that collateral. Dai debt incurs a stability fee (i.e., continuously accruing interest), which is paid upon repayment of borrowed Dai. DAI is collected as system surplus, and then used in FLAP auctions to burn MKR.

MKR can also be used as a governance token to govern the system. MKR holders also act as the last line of defense in case of a black swan event. If system-wide collateral value falls too low too fast, MKR is minted and sold on the open market to raise more collateral, diluting MKR holders.

142,"Introduction

BounceBit is excited to propose the integration of Venus’s lending and borrowing services into the BounceBit chain. This collaboration aims to enhance the functionality and reach of both platforms by supporting BounceBit’s native assets, BBTC and BBUSD, which are Liquidity-Secured Derivatives (LSD) from Ceffu. The integration will enable effective funding rate arbitrage and yield generation for these assets, aligning with the strategic goals of both entities to foster innovation and growth in the DeFi ecosystem.

Background

BounceBit’s unique CeDeFi infrastructure blends centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) to provide parallel yield generation. Users can earn original CeFi yield while utilizing LSD for BTC staking and on-chain farming, known as restaking in Bitcoin. This ecosystem offers three types of yield for Bitcoin holders: original CeFi yield, node operation rewards from staking BTC on the BounceBit chain, and opportunity yield from participating in on-chain applications and the Bounce Launchpad.

BBTC and BBUSD have been developed as part of a strategic initiative to leverage the stability and security of LSD mechanisms provided by Ceffu. The primary goal is to facilitate seamless and profitable interactions in arbitrage and lending/borrowing scenarios on the BounceBit chain.

Value to the Community

Integrating Venus’s lending and borrowing services with BounceBit will bring significant value to the community through several use cases:

Enhanced Utility and Liquidity: BBTC and BBUSD holders can leverage their assets for yield farming, staking, and arbitrage within a secure and efficient framework.

Premium Yield Generation: Users can participate in premium yield generation strategies such as funding rate arbitrage through Ceffu’s MirrorX solution, enabling access to deep liquidity on multiple asset markets with reduced counterparty risk.

Comprehensive Asset Management: Users gain access to diversified asset management services, allowing them to choose strategies that best fit their risk tolerance and investment goals.

Security and Compliance: The integration will adhere to high standards of security and regulatory compliance, ensuring user trust and system integrity.

Additional Information

● Stablecoin Support: BBUSD is backed 1:1 by USDT and FDUSD in Ceffu, enhancing its stability and reliability. Stablecoins from various EVM-compatible Chains, such as FDUSD on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) and USDT on Ethereum, can be bridged into the BounceBit ecosystem. Once transferred, these tokens are uniformly mapped and represented as BBUSD within BounceBit.
● KYC Requirements: KYC is only required for very large customers to participate in CeDeFi activities, maintaining ease of access while ensuring compliance.
Proposal

We propose that Venus deploy its lending and borrowing protocols on the BounceBit chain to support BBTC and BBUSD. This deployment will allow BounceBit users to leverage their assets for additional financial operations, such as yield farming and arbitrage, within the safe and efficient framework provided by Venus.

Technical Considerations

● Asset Compatibility: BounceBit will ensure that BBTC and BBUSD are fully compatible with Venus protocols by aligning with the technical requirements of Venus. This includes adapting the asset management to integrate smoothly with Venus’s operations on both testnet and mainnet.
● Security and Compliance: User contributions to Total Value Locked (TVL) are securely managed by Mainnet Digital’s regulated custodial services, assuring both compliance and safety. These assets are then mirrored via Ceffu’s MirrorX service, a key integration by BounceBit that maintains on-chain visibility and transparency of these assets. All integrations will adhere to the highest standards of security and regulatory compliance, with regular audits and reviews to maintain system integrity and user trust.
Implementation Phases

Initial Testing on Testnet: Deploy Venus protocols on the BounceBit testnet for initial integration testing and to gather user feedback.

Deployment on Mainnet: Following successful testnet trials and necessary adjustments, deploy the protocols on the BounceBit mainnet.

Expected Outcomes

● Enhanced utility and liquidity for BBTC and BBUSD on the BounceBit platform.
● Expanded opportunities for users to engage in lending, borrowing, and arbitrage.
● Strengthened collaboration between BounceBit and Venus, setting a precedent for futurecooperative efforts within the DeFi ecosystem.
Conclusion

BounceBit’s infrastructure is meticulously architected to elevate Bitcoin’s status from a passive asset to an active, yield-generating instrument. By offering an integrated platform where Bitcoin holders can capitalize on the strengths of both CeFi and DeFi, BounceBit is pioneering a new chapter in asset optimization and financial innovation within the blockchain space.We believe this proposal aligns with the strategic goals of both Venus and BounceBit, offering substantial benefits to our users and the broader DeFi community. We look forward to your feedback and hope for a positive response to proceed with this exciting initiative.

About BounceBit

BounceBit is a pioneering platform in the blockchain space, integrating CeFi and DeFi to offer users a seamless and secure experience. Our CeDeFi infrastructure, supported by regulated custodial services like Mainnet Digital and Ceffu, ensures the highest standards of security and compliance. 

BounceBit aims to enhance the Total Value Locked (TVL) within its ecosystem through innovative yield generation strategies and asset management services. By bridging BTC and other assets into the BounceBit ecosystem, we enable users to maximize their returns through diversified investment opportunities and active participation in the on-chain economy.",bullish
143,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z  The Happy Ape, an official MBA #00349, is a premium brand that aims to foster a culture of kindness, compassion and positive mental health in our future generations. This AIP would directly fund the creation of The Happy Ape children’s book and plush, nfc tags, and dapp development on ApeChain creating a unique digi-physical web3 experience for both kids and adults. I believe in the future of ApeCoin and am proudly offering a 20% gross revenue back to the dao based on the initial products sold. With the development of AIP-378 I will use ApeChain and $Ape to create innovative solutions, and integrate them into the products. Bored Labs, LLC. will take on the majority of work that is required, reducing costs needed from the dao and includes but is not limited to, e-commerce site creation [thehappyape.io](thehappyape.io), add $Ape as an accepted payment for our products, develop the majority of ApeChain dapp work, and nfc configuration. All development will be open source and will be fully audited, ideally by boring security dao or in cooperation with Horizen Labs. (edited)

What makes any of this special? Our children’s book will be one of the very first web3 books that can not only teach children and parents about the power of the blockchain, but also onboard them as well using ApeChain. The book is fully written and authored by myself. Here is a quick summary of the book below, or skip it for the juicy tech.

![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/4/4fa2a982de08cd201b68bfb210630005b085a7f8_2_500x500.jpeg)

“The Happy Ape and his friend journey on a daily adventure, gathering bananas amidst the vibrant jungle. Their routine centers around a central tree housing a precious book where their banana counts are meticulously tallied and stored. When theft of the only book shatters their dreams, The Happy Ape crafts a magical book, uniting the jungle’s apes in trust. With every ape receiving a copy of the newfound magical book, no one could lie, steal or cheat because all books have to agree. All of the ape’s lives changed for the better, The Happy Ape and his friend finally could purchase the coveted bouncy ball, playing happily ever after together.”

Such an amazing story isn’t it, how can it get any better? I plan on integrating an nfc tag into every book. Thus delivering a digi-physical experience allowing the user to scan the tag with a compatible mobile device and instantly mint a digital version of their book. This will be a seamless cost free user interaction all powered by our ApeChain (kudos Horizen Labs). In order to do all of this I plan on partnering with IYK, a premier supplier of nfc tags in the web3 space. Their mobile app will allow easy access to our digi-physical experience. This requires the development of smart contracts and a dapp on ApeChain. The development will be achieved through Bored Labs, LLC., and will be open source. I believe that open source development leads to better community adoption, security, and transparency. I have many plans for the evolution of our digi-physical experience as well. IYK allows for OTA updates, easy updates to modules introducing the user to new features like unique stories, animations and more. In addition to this experience I will also have an e-commerce site with the ability to purchase the products with $Ape.

To ensure an unforgettable and joyful experience, I have designed with meticulous attention to detail, a special Happy Ape plush, ensuring they become cherished friends for all. This plush will be approximately 15’’ in length and 6’’ wide. Many plushies are small and not even comfy. Our design ensures a warm, soft, and comfy embrace. The Happy Ape is sure to be a loving companion for so many around the world.

So…“Who are you entrusting valuable DAO funds to, you may wonder, and what qualifies me for it?”

Let me start off by introducing myself. My name is Kevin, I’m 37 and I’m married with 3 kids. 8 yo girl, 6 yo boy, 2 yo girl. I’m a software architect and I’ve been in the web3 space for a few years. I have run a successful software company, Bored Labs, LLC., for 3 years now. I have bookshelves full of children’s books and bags full of plushies. The amount of time I’ve spent reading to my kids and playing with plushies is measured in years! I believe in the power of community and helping others which is why I am here. My passion to share kindness and love back into the world while helping others is what motivates me to do this. I want to provide value back to the various communities connected to apecoin and help them grow as well. I hope that through future collaborations I can work with other communities like bulls on the block and mocaverse to continue creating positive and inspirational children’s books along with animated videos. I believe this is a small stepping stone that will lead to a much larger goal of combining web3 ip use to bring people together.

I added a budget for marketing that will help ensure reach and the success of my brand. Half of the marketing budget will be given back to the buyers of my products. A simple marketing strategy i’ll rely on will be asking product buyers to post images of themselves with my products and reward them with $APE. The other half will be reserved for various marketing efforts as needed.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
 Most importantly ApeCoin DAO will be supporting and empowering our future generations through a unique onboarding digi-physical experience that will help amplify innovative solutions on ApeChain. This AIP will help promote the use and growth of ApeChain and $APE by building one of the first dapps that will help onboard many new users and introduce them to ApeCoin. The Happy Ape products aim to give more visibility to the ApeCoin community in a positive light. We will also be reaching a new audience that we haven’t explored much of. Our products support kindness, compassion, and positive mental health which is something we could all use more of.

We’re offering 20% gross revenue back to the DAO to show gratitude and continued support back to the community. (Detailed under our Overall Cost)

As a result of this proposal, IYK has promised that they would add ApeChain as a supported chain to their application.

This would allow anyone using IYK to use ApeChain as their selected chain to mint nfts on. It would help guide the development and use of digi-physical experiences on ApeChain, and directly fund code that is open source leading to better security and adoption starting within our community. We need a better way for fast adoption of ApeCoin.

I will ensure resources like artists/animators are from the ApeCoin community. With many more future books and animated videos I plan to collaborate with more ApeCoin communities. I promise to innovate new ways of incorporating ApeChain and $Ape into our future products as this is just a stepping stone for us. It’s important that we continue development around ApeChain and $APE. I would be honored to have ApeCoin DAO help us cultivate positivity into many lives of our next generation around the world.

LDO would be the first Ethereum liquid staking protocol governance token to be listed on Aave. Aave would benefit from being the first major lending market to list LDO. Users will be able to express various trading views on LDO’s price outlook in the lead up to Shanghai.
 
The risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs, with this post using the parameters agreed between the two service providers.

# Motivation

Lido is a suite of software protocols that facilitates liquid staking across multiple blockchains. The Lido DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation. The LDO token is used to vote on the use of the DAO treasury associated with the protocols, research and development, and incentive programs.

The Lido DAO is an Aragon organization. The LDO token was created using an [Aragon Minime contract](https://aragon.org/dao). Since Aragon provides a full end-to-end framework to build DAOs, Lido DAO uses its standard tools.

LDO Token Ethereum Address: `0x5a98fcbea516cf06857215779fd812ca3bef1b32`

LDO is a Top 50 token by market cap, currently ranked [36th](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao) by Coingecko. Lido Protocol is the largest minter of liquid staked ETH tokens with [4,917,554 ETH staked](https://lido.fi/ethereum).

Making LDO available on Aave v3 would make Aave V3 the first major lending market to do so and would benefit from the first mover advantage.

Currently, stETH is listed on Aave v2 and wstETH is listed on the Aave v3 Ethereum liquidity pools. wstETH has also been approved by Aave Governance for being listed on the Optimism, Arbitrum and hopefully the Polygon v3 liquidity pools. Lido DAO would like to also propose to include the Lido governance token, LDO.

[Add wstETH on v3 Optimism](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-wsteth-to-aave-v3-on-optimism/10932)
[Add wstETH on v3 Arbitrum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-wsteth-on-arbitrum-aave-v3/11387)
[Add wstETH on v3 Polygon](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-wsteth-on-polygon-v3/12266)

Title: [ARFC]  Retroactive bug bounties proposal (pre-Immunefi)

Author: BGD Labs @bgdlabs

Date: 2024-01-09

---

## Summary

Request for bounties pending from before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi official bug bounty program, amounting a grand total of $86’500.

**The objective of this ARFC is to pre-authorise such payments, to be processed via an on-chain AIP**

## Motivation

Before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty program on [September 25th 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/325/), security reports by white hats where evaluated in an ad-hoc basis, proposing bounties/rewards following an approach like on [this proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077). That was not optimal, as there was no formal scope defined, or strict ranges of bounties depending on severity and impact.

Currently, every report is being processed via Immunefi and the rules of the Aave program, however, there were other reports submitted via other channel before that (usually security@aave.com). As these reports should be evaluated at time of submission for fairness, and outside of the Immunefi scope defined afterwards, we think it is a good idea to reward them separately and retro-actively outside the program.

## Specification

### Reports

First of all, we want to clarify certain aspects for the community:

- The proposed rewards and evaluation metrics follow the ones we did ad-hoc in the past [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077#clarification-on-evaluation-2), as we don’t think it is fair for the white-hats to apply the rewards ranges on the current Immunefi program and out-of-scope rules, as they were defined afterwards.
- In one of the cases, we recommended the white hat to submit the report via Immunefi, in order to have access to the mediation procedure of the platform. As this mediation process was finally requested by the white hat, Immunefi charges the corresponding fee of 10% of the amount, which we think is legitimate.
- At the moment, *we are not disclosing the full details of some of the reports*, because even if none of them create any risk for Aave now, one has dependencies with another report (not disclosed yet) and the other could increase risk to non-Aave entities.


### 1. Inconsistent validation on  Aave v2/v3

When calling `borrow()` with stable rate mode on Aave v2 and v3, one of the validations is that not more than a percentage of the total available liquidity can be borrowed at once.

However, `swapBorrowRateMode()` doesn’t validate the same, which is unexpected and could lead to more stable rate borrowings than intended.

It is important to highlight that this is not possible at the moment, with minting of stable rate disabled.


**Severity:  Low**

The issue didn’t create any immediate problem in the protocol, but overexposure to stable rate mode is not expected.

**Likelihood:  Certain**

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.

**Proposed bounty:** 10’000 USD

---

### 2. Inconsistent HF (Health Factor) behaviour swap borrow rate mode

When swapping borrow rate mode, the HF of an user is not validated, as debt should remain the same. However, under edge scenarios, the HF of an user could slightly change (by ~1 unit of lowest asset’s decimals).


**Severity:  No impact**

This is not a bug or creates any exploit scenario, but it is unexpected behaviour.

**Likelihood:  Certain**

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.

**Proposed bounty:** 5’000 USD

---

### 3. Price manipulation of asset listed on Aave

By executing a complex strategy (involving compromising the asset’s trusted infrastructure), it could be possible to inflate the price of one of the assets listed on Aave v2.

Even if this belongs more to the centralisation risk of the asset, and we don’t consider a bug of the protocol, it was taken into account for off-boarding consideration of the asset by risk providers of Aave, and we believe it is fair to reward retro-actively.

As this risk still exist on the asset itself and more protocols could be using it, even if we don’t really see any immediate risk, we will not be disclosing at the moment details of it, until the team applies extra measures.


**Severity:  Critical**

Being a price manipulation, the impact on the protocol would hypotetically be important.

**Likelihood: Not likely**

The attack involves compromising asset’s infrastructure (which would directly disqualify on the current Aave <> Immunefi program), together with extra techniques; so we consider it theoretically possible, but highly improbable.

**Proposed bounty:** 65’000 USD. Additionally, 6’500 USD as Immunefi fee.

## Next steps

If this ARFC is positive, afterwards we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal, releasing the funds to the corresponding addresses.",bullish

Many other top protocols already have this functionality. PancakeSwap cannot stay behind in this.

For example, an user wants to add liquidity to USDC-BUSD pool, but only holds BUSD. This user needs to swap an x% amount of BUSD to USDC MANUALLY and then proceed to adding the desired amount.

150,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-gauntlet-and-the-ballers-multisig-to-manage-pool-parameters/2400).

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable Gauntlet and a multisig controlled by Ballers to control certain parameters of the Boosted Pools so as to increase their capital efficiency and returns to liquidity providers.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) contain a series of parameters that affect their efficiency and can be tuned depending on market conditions:

* Boosted Stable Pools ( `StablePhantomPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * amplification parameter
  * token rate cache duration
* Boosted Linear Pools ( `AaveLinearPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * lower target
  * upper target

Gauntlet has been managing fees and amplification factor in weighted and stable pools, and would be able to do so for Boosted Stable Pools if this proposal is approved by the community.

The duration of the token rate cache can have an impact on a boosted pool’s capital efficiency. If the duration is too long, the pool can be arbed for all the interest accrued on Aave since the last update of the cache. A short duration mitigates this risk, with the downside of increasing gas costs for trades.

On Linear Pools, swap fees are not collected by liquidity providers, but rather act as an incentive for arbitragers/keepers to:

1. withdraw main tokens from the pool, deposit them in Aave and deposit the aTokens in the pool when it has main tokens in excess;
2. withdraw aTokens from the pool, withdraw the underlying from Aave and deposit the main token to the pool when it has a low balance of main tokens;

The lower and upper targets determine a range within which no fee in imposed on trades between main tokens and Aave tokens. A trader moving the balance of main tokens away from this range pays a fee to the pool, which the pool then returns to traders that move the balance back towards the range.

While we’re confident that Gauntlet can hit the ground running with respect to optimizing the swap fee and amplification factor of Boosted Stable Pools, there’s still much to be learned when it comes to the other four parameters described above. For this reason, this proposal would authorize a multisig held by Ballers to set those parameters. Balancer Labs would monitor the activiy on the pools and the market conditions and advise on the the best course of action, but Ballers would be the ultimate decision makers, acting on behalf of BAL holders. All updates would be announced in Discord beforehand.

151,"[Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-institute-a-voting-delay-period/5787)
## Simple Summary 
A proposal to increase the voting delay period for all on-chain governance proposals (AIPs).
## Background
Aave governance proposals (AIPs) vary in complexity, scope, and impact. As Aave  continues to make progress on its growth trajectory, it is becoming obvious that certain proposals need to allow more time for pre-vote analysis. For instance, [AIP-33: Add FEI to Aave V2](https://app.aave.com/governance/35-QmbfLFGJdZQn21pwJGQzVnFqLk4vXHTmHUhio8ArWmvVqZ) was, fortunately, able to be canceled, via delegation removal, rather than needing to use the [Aave Guardian](https://medium.com/aave/aave-protocol-governance-v2-has-been-activated-af4a4b228885). 

![](https://i.imgur.com/aCML4k3.png)


This month has seen the most governance proposals (9) of any month since Aave V2 has launched with no sign of slowing given the variety of authors and proposal type.
## Proposal 
A formal analysis period is defined as a non-voting period where a proposal is active (e.g. submitted on-chain). Currently, the `votingDelay` configured on [Aave governance](https://etherscan.io/address/0xec568fffba86c094cf06b22134b23074dfe2252c#readContract) is set to 0 - voting begins immediately when proposals are created.

![](https://i.imgur.com/J7ohC0U.png)


 We propose to set this voting delay to 2 days, in seconds, using the `setVotingDelay` method on the core governance contract. Setting the `votingDelay` will cause there to be a new review period between the proposal submission and when voting for that proposal begins. 

We encourage the community to chime in via comments below but should mention there is precedent for this in Compound (see [Governance Analysis Period proposal](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/43)).
## Potential Side Effects 
- The Guardian is marginally more likely to be needed should time sensitive issues arise.
- Gauntlet’s risk parameterization will see a delay from time to identifying a suboptimal risk parameter to executing a change. At least until a `riskAdmin` role is implemented.

152,"# Abstract

THX Network requests to whitelist its Gnosis Safe multisig address to enable it to lock B-80BAL-20WETH into veBAL and participate in governance and gauge voting.

# Motivation

THX Network allows creators and communities to create and embed ERC20 and ERC721 tokens in their platforms and social channels. The project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under agreement No 82888 (Blockpool) and No 824509 (Block.IS).

$THX is the project’s governance token launched in dec. 2021 using a Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) and has its main source of liquidity on Balancer’s Polygon deployment (~$900k TVL).

Our emerging DAO is about to diversify its treasury into $BAL and participate in Balancer’s governance.

# Specification

We’re requesting to whitelist the THX Network Gnosis Safe multisig, to interact with the veBAL contract. Address: 0x4a30c80A2c41312ce4ee79f730C8D84cAD9f7B31",bullish
153,"#### ABSTRACT

The goal of this proposal is to establish the ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group.

The ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group’s mandate is to:
“Build income generating projects for the ApeCoin DAO, ApeCoin Initiatives like ThankApe, Boring Security DAO, MBA licensed projects and the ApeCoin community. ApeChain will be a strong focus point once we reach that point.”

Working Groups enable a sustainable community-led infrastructure that further decentralizes the DAO, creates operational efficiency, and is flexible enough to adapt to any opportunities that may arise.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

It was recently announced that the ApeCoin DAO can receive revenue from AIPs and projects within the Ape and ApeCoin communities. There has been much talk around bringing much needed value back to the DAO and believe there needs to be a more structured focus on doing this. The ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group will focus solely on this and aims to create various projects and initiatives that will serve this exact purpose.

Working together as a community I feel we can implement various simple solutions that will drive value and needed resources back into the DAO and other initiatives alleviating the sell pressure on our much loved $APE token. In addition we expect to see the ApeChain come to life sooner, rather than later and there needs to be a strong focus on building on this to ensure it’s long term success.

If you build it, they will come…

#### OVERALL COST

$0

This AIP serves as an initial framework to establish this Working Group. The three elected Stewards will propose a budget 1-3 weeks after being onboarded.

## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.


# The Farm:
In order to host the MASK Syrup Pool, we will need to provide a MASK-BNB farm that will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours and then 0.5x CAKE rewards after that. 


# What is Mask Network?

[**Mask Network**](https://mask.io/) aims to bridge Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 making it possible for users on Twitter and Facebook to use Web 3.0 features. Some features include payment & tipping, trading on a decentralized exchange, decentralized file storage or buying and selling NFTs - all without leaving the social network site.

Mask Network has partnered with leading projects (such as CoinMarketCap, Uniswap, Arweave and more). The project is chain agnostic, and supports, amongst others, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Polygon.

Mask Network received the strategic investment from Binance in April, and both parties aim to build a multi-chain metaverse that includes Binance Smart Chain. The completion of the cross-chain asset bridge is a key step for Mask Network to enter the Web 3.0 multi-chain era. The boundary of the Mask Network ecosystem has now expanded to BSC. Mask Network will cooperate with all sorts of amazing projects in the BSC ecosystem and take outstanding applications on BSC onto the Mask Network in a fast and seamless way, to attract more users to play in the more efficient and convenient Web 3.0 multi-chain universe.

168,"Once every month PancakeSwap holds a CAKE emission reduction vote, in an effort to speed up our mission to become emission neutral.

# What does emission neutral mean?
Simple, the goal is for more CAKE to leave circulation than the amount of CAKE that's produced.

# Why do we want to reduce CAKE emissions? 
In the short term, reducing the rewards may lower farms’ APR a little initially. However, if you’re a long-term CAKE hodler, you’ll understand the potential effect to the price that reducing the amount of CAKE in circulation may have. **Supply and demand**.

CAKE emissions are **20 CAKE per block** at the moment, which break down as per the image below.

- 10 CAKE per block go to yield farms
- Total emissions = 20 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pool)

# 🔥 0.5 CAKE per block (5%) reduction to farm rewards:

169,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas/1437). If approved, changes would take effect at **00:00 UTC on Monday, March 8**.

On behalf of the Balancer community, I’d like to propose significant modifications to the ongoing gas reimbursement campaign. We have heard some concerns that the campaign is confusing and that it isn’t clear how much BAL a user will receive for a given trade. During these times of network congestion and high gas costs, we want to provide everyone with an opportunity to trade on Balancer. With that in mind, it doesn’t seem fair to ask users to exercise blind faith and wait until “next Wednesday” to find out what they’ve earned from trading. We would like to make every effort to simplify the campaign and improve transparency; what you see is what you get, or at least as close as possible. We plan to accomplish this by removing various sources of uncertainty from the reimbursement calculations so that it is possible to get an estimate ahead of time and display it to the user at the time of trade submission.

# The Proposal
Allocate **30,000 BAL** from the Ecosystem Fund to the “BAL for Gas'' campaign. There is no fixed time period; the budget is consumed on a **first-come, first-served** basis. When the budget is exhausted, the campaign is suspended until it is replenished by BAL governance.

For **each eligible trade made through the Balancer Exchange Proxy**, award claimable BAL tokens to the trader. An eligible trade is a trade containing one or more eligible swaps, where an eligible swap is a **swap between any two tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json)**. Claims are made available at the [BAL claims interface](https://claim.balancer.finance/#/) on Wednesday (UTC time) following the close of the weekly period (00:00 UTC Monday - 23:59 UTC Sunday) in which the trade occurred.

The amount of gas to be reimbursed is predetermined by the number of eligible swaps within the transaction:

![table|690x185](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/dd83c24ba43bd36e91396a5b6296f4c92cc986c2.png)

For converting gas to BAL, use the **median gas price of the enclosing block** and the **BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko** closest to the block time.

# Motivation
The proposal above may seem familiar, but there are some very important distinctions between this and the previous reimbursement program. All modifications share the common goal of improving user experience, which we believe is a matter of simplification and transparency.

First, this proposed campaign makes no effort to account for the _actual_ expenses of the user. Both the amount of gas consumed by the transaction and the gas price ultimately paid are irrelevant. Instead, deterministic figures are favored: the amount of gas is fixed depending on the number of swaps, and the gas price is the block median, rather than the user’s own price. It is simply too difficult to accurately predict the parameters of a given transaction ahead of time, whereas it is much easier to predict block-wide parameters. Predictability informs transparency.

The second major shift pertains to the budget. The existing program allocates a fixed weekly budget, which can sometimes necessitate cuts to the reimbursements in order to avoid excess spending. Such cuts can only be known _after_ the weekly period has ended, and therefore the existence of a weekly budget renders any trade-time estimates useless. In contrast, here we propose a fixed total budget which is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. This allows us to add reimbursement estimates to the Exchange UI at the time of the trade. If there are still funds remaining in the budget, the user will see an estimate of the amount of BAL to be awarded; and if the budget is exhausted, then the user will simply be informed as such and the estimate will be zero. When the well runs dry, BAL governors can decide whether to replenish and continue the campaign.

Third, the BAL/ETH price model is modified. Whereas the ongoing campaign uses the median price for the whole weekly period, the proposed campaign uses the price as close as possible to the actual block time. Knowing the approximate price at the time of the trade allows us to make informed estimates about the amount of BAL to be awarded.

![image|690x120](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/e00a59183e29b37e29369999caccc6035028b810.png)

Finally, the fixed amounts of gas (130k, 220k, 300k, 400k) were chosen so that only 1% of all trades, on average, would be overcompensated. This should be sufficient to prevent gaming the system for profit, but nonetheless **we reserve the right to filter out suspicious activity**. The Balancer Exchange UI will never perform more than four swaps in a single trade, which is why only four numbers are provided; any transactions containing 5+ swaps must belong to bots, whereas the target audience is end users. We simply cap the reimbursement amount at 400,000 gas; any additional eligible swaps beyond the first four will yield no further benefit.

# Mechanics
Although every effort is made to be as transparent and accurate as possible, there is still a very small amount of room for error. Here we will detail how the BAL amounts are computed both at trade time (estimated) and at dispersal time (actual).

At the time of the trade:

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **estimated** gas price for display purposes is the median from the last few blocks according to the `getGasPrice()` function from the web3 provider. This should provide a good corollary to the median of the actual trade block, which cannot be known in advance.
4. The **estimated** BAL/ETH price for display purposes is queried from the large [80/20 BAL/WETH pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x59a19d8c652fa0284f44113d0ff9aba70bd46fb4/). This acts as a real-time oracle which isn’t worth manipulating because it is only used to display an estimate and not to compute an actual award amount.
5. The user will see, in one summary number, the final result of #1-4: the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for this particular trade, assuming there are still funds left in the budget. A USD estimate is also provided for completeness, with the BAL/USD price being queried from CoinGecko’s API.

The UI changes are still being finalized, but as a mockup consider the image below.

![image2|485x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/1174949f6ce920677d9102bbf6ee0a35627776b8.png)

At dispersal time (computed by the [open source mining scripts](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts)):

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **actual** gas price is the median from the block containing the trade. We will filter out artificially low-price transactions which are sometimes included by miners and can skew the median - these are typically 0-gwei or 1-gwei transactions.
4. The **actual** BAL/ETH price is queried from the CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

It should be clear that the only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are most likely quite small: the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block, and the 80/20 BAL/WETH price may not perfectly match CoinGecko’s BAL/ETH price. All in all, the user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time, and this improved user experience should bring more traders to the campaign.

This proposal aims to introduce an NFT event check-in solution based on ApeChain, combining hardware products (NFC chips and scanners) and software products (an app based on ApeChain) to provide NFT holders with an immersive experience at all NFT offline events.

*Specific Implementation Plan:*

In terms of hardware products, we will use NFC technology combined with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) to embed NFC chips into peripheral products, including clothing, hats, toys, and skateboards. We will also design and manufacture NFC scanners to detect products with NFC chips and read selected NFT image data in an app based on ApeChain, then display on a large screen to realize the conceptual scenario of NFT as our web3 identity and participate in real offline events. Simultaneously, scanners will also be used to support the “Unmanned check-in” model in Merch stores.

In terms of software products, we will develop an app based on ApeChain, offering features such as wallet connecting, NFT selection, and animated scene corresponding to the ticket you purchased. The app will provide a user-friendly interface for NFT holders to easily use the check-in system. All check-in animations can be individually created and saved by users, forming a unique user-generated content (UGC) culture, which also makes it easier to spread within communities and out of the web3. For event organizers, animating event tickets to become a unique background for attendees can help expand the brand’s influence and generate much higher traffic than traditional marketing methods.

This solution will fully leverage the image of all NFTs, providing NFT holders with a more immersive experience and enriching existing methods of peripheral product distribution. It will create unique and native web3 gameplay during the offline events and provide all NFTs with more practical value beyond avatars.


### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The proposed NFT event check-in solution will bring several benefits to the APECHAIN ecosystem:

* Enhanced Adoption and Engagement: By providing NFT holders with an immersive experience at web3 offline events, the solution will increase adoption and engagement within the $APE ecosystem. NFT holders will feel more connected to the ecosystem and be incentivized to participate in events and activities.
* Increased Visibility and Recognition: The innovative nature of the check-in solution, coupled with its use of ApeChain, will enhance the visibility and recognition of $APE in the broader market. This will attract more users, projects, and potential collaborators to the ecosystem, driving its growth and fostering a vibrant community.
* Diversification of Use Cases: The check-in solution will demonstrate the versatility of $APE beyond where we are right now, showcasing its potential in the realm of NFT event management and engagement. This diversification of use cases will attract new projects and investors to $APE, expanding its reach and utility.

Overall, the NFT event check-in solution will contribute to the growth and development of the APE CHAIN ecosystem, defining APE CHAIN as the primary chain for all NFTs and continuously providing value for all $APE holders.



### OVERALL COST 
Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 480,000 $APE The specific allocation is as follows:

1. Hardware Design and Production (50% of the budget, 240,000 $APE):
* NFC Chip Design and Production: 100,000 $APE
    * Design and Customization: 80,000 $APE
    * Production and Assembly: 20,000 $APE
* NFC Scanner Development and Production: 120,000 $APE
    * Design and Development: 80,000 $APE
    * Production and Assembly: 40,000 $APE
* Display Equipment: 20,000 $APE

2. Software Development and Testing (40% of the budget, 192,000 $APE):
* APP Development: 115,200 $APE
    * Front-end Development: 38,400 $APE
    * Back-end Development: 38,400 $APE
    * Blockchain Integration and Smart Contract Development: 38,400 $APE
* Application Testing and Optimization: 48,000 $APE
    * Functional Testing: 19,200 $APE
    * Security Testing: 19,200 $APE
    * User Experience Optimization: 9,600 $APE
* Entrance Animation Creation and Display Function: 28,800 $APE
    * Animation Design and Development: 19,200 $APE
    * Animation Display Technology Integration: 9,600 $APE

3. User Testing, Promotion, and Launch (10% of the budget, 48,000 $APE):
* User Testing and Feedback Collection: 19,200$APE
    * User Testing Planning and Execution: 9,600 $APE
    * User Feedback Collection and Analysis: 9,600 $APE
* Product Promotion and Marketing: 19,200 $APE
    * Social Media Marketing: 9,600 $APE
    * Online and Offline Event Promotion: 9,600 $APE
* Launch Preparation and Support: 9,600 $APE
    * Platform Launch Preparation: 4,800 $APE
    * Technical Support and Maintenance: 4,800 $APE

This detailed description of fund allocation will ensure the smooth development, testing, and promotion of both hardware and software products, guarantee the high quality and user satisfaction of the final product.
We do not have an estimate of costs for users to use the app’s features at the moment; we will know the cost range once the app development is complete and we begin the user testing phase.

##### APECOIN REVENUE MODEL:
Single Instance Revenue Forecast

![Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 4.58.59 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreifltrbdt2idzmxfeipb6il7veqa5nzfw3lagkxvj2hh6snljhq2a4)
    
##### Total Revenue:* 120,000 $APE + Total Revenue * 1%

This table clearly outlines the revenue forecast for a single instance, providing a comprehensive view of the potential earnings from our proposed solution.

*50% of gross revenues will be returned to APECOIN DAO, in perpetuity.

NOTE:
* Fees will be charged for the services provided by the check-in solution and “Unmanned check-in” model, and only $APE will be used for payment.
* Offline merch stores adopting the “Unmanned check-in” model can only be paid with $APE.
* NFC customization will be charged separately and paid for using $APE.
* $APE will be consumed in the APP as Gas fee

By implementing this proposal, APECOIN will establish a robust check-in solution that benefits NFT holders, drives revenue growth, and expands its influence in the web3 space.

Summary:

Kelp proposes to add a veBAL gauge for the [rsETH/WETH] on [Balancer]

References/Useful links:

• Website: https://kelpdao.xyz/restake/

• Documentation: https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp

• Github Public Repo: https://github.com/Kelp-DAO/KelpDAO-contracts

Protocol Description:

rsETH is the largest LST-based liquid restaked token on the EigenLayer ecosystem. It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs

Kelp has more than 260,000 ETH worth of assets restaked by over 40,000 users across multiple L2s. All of this is within 6 months of launch

By providing liquidity for the restaked positions, rsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.

Motivation:

Kelp is seeking to establish the [rsETH/wETH on Ethereum] and on Balancer to further enrich the liquidity of rsETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Kelp community.

Specifications:

1. Governance: Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon

2. Oracles: Kelp’s mainnet rseTH rate provider has been reviewed [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/rsETHRateProvider.md).

3. Audits: Kelp’s smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena.

182,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to hire a Head of Network Development to help oversee matters within theAPE Foundation, supporting our community in achieving its strategic goals and ensuring operational excellence. The Head of Network Development will be responsible for supporting daily operations, facilitating strategic planning, coordinating community engagement, and
representing the DAO in external affairs. Additionally, this role will be well-positioned to make recommendations for further improvements as needed. For clarity’s sake, this position does not equate to a chief executive officer or “leader”, but rather a critical support function for the APE Foundation and the DAO.

To optimize efficiency and create cost savings, this proposal also includes a proposed reduction in future Special Council members’ payments to offset the cost of this hire. The APE Foundation will be empowered to oversee the hiring process for this position, ensuring that all legal, tax, and other relevant considerations are thoroughly addressed and optimized. The Head of Network Development will serve at the pleasure of the Special Council, the DAO’s Advisory Board.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
As ApeCoin DAO continues to expand, the need for ongoing, dedicated, and professional support at the APE Foundation has become increasingly evident. A Head of Network Development will offer essential oversight, strategic facilitation, and operational management, ensuring the ApeCoin DAO fulfills its mission efficiently and effectively. This role is vital for maintaining momentum, building community trust, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the DAO. Additionally, this position will allow our Special Council to focus on their responsibilities as the Advisory Board they are intended to be.

##### OVERALL COST 
USD $120,000 per annum paid in $APE. However, we will reduce Special Council member payments to offset this cost. Effectively makes this proposal zero additional cost to the DAO up to USD $125,000 once the reduction of the Special Council members payments kicks in (January 1, 2025).

APE Foundation could use its discretionary authority to go over USD $125,000 per annum if a competitive salary for this role is deemed necessary.

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Launch Aave V3 on Kava EVM 

Author: [Various Kava Ecosystem Contributors]

Created: 2023-12-12

---

# Summary

KAVA in collaboration with PGov and Michigan Blockchain propose the integration of Aave V3 with KAVA. KAVA’s EVM compatibility and integration will be a crucial advancement for the Aave multichain vision. The integration will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Cosmos and enables Cosmos ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through KAVA

# Motivation

This proposal aims to be a starting point in the process of bringing Aave to the KAVA Ecosystem and aims to provide necessary details to the Aave community to consider the merits of KAVA integration. Kava has been building out the cornerstones of a solid DeFi ecosystem since mainnet launch in 2022. The key dexes in the ecosystem are Kinetix (a Uniswap v3 dex plus perpetual trading platform built by the Quickswap team from Polygon), WAGMI (protocol owned liquidity dex), and Equilibre (a ve3,3 dex). There are a few burgeoning lending protocols on the chain, but with the team’s plans to deprecate the existing leading lending protocol on the Cosmos SDK side, Kava Lend, there exists an incredible opportunity for a blue chip lending protocol like Aave to establish market dominance on the EVM side.

In addition to the market opportunity, the Kava ecosystem has an ongoing incentive program called the Kava Rise program which incentivizes protocol usage pro-rata based on TVL per protocol. Currently 1M Kava is being distributed per month to protocols pro-rata. Due to the proclivity for lending protocols to attract a significant portion of TVL in an ecosystem, Aave stands to earn the majority of these rewards. The current distribution of rewards is 1M Kava per month, and can increase pending governance approval as the ecosystem matures.

The Kava Foundation has committed to providing liquidity mining rewards of a minimum of 1M Kava guaranteed over the first year for the Aave community.

*Benefits of deploying on Kava*

With the KAVA integration, Aave gets additional markets with Market Cap of $740M, ~200M of locked liquidity, native assets like ATOM, USDT, WBTC and more. KAVA itself is connected well within the Cosmos ecosystem, thus the integration will also enable the cosmos community to plug its deep $60Bn liquidity to Aave through KAVA.

- Kava today is the 12th largest chain by TVL, and 9th by number of deployed protocols as per DefiLlama 2
- Kava is an EVM built on top of the Cosmos SDK, this also facilitates bringing Cosmos assets (like ATOM) natively onto the Protocol, which is not possible on other EVMs. AAVE has the opportunity to connect trading in the Cosmos and Ethereum.
- Kava is the largest of such an EVM chain with native Cosmos integration capabilities.

*Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment*

In addition, Kava has recently garnered a partnership with Tether, as Tether selected Kava to be the native USDT distributor across the Cosmos. In other words, if a user wants an IBC denominated USDT that’s natively issued by Tether, that USDT needs to originate from Kava. In just a few short months, there has been over $150M USDT natively issued on the Kava blockchain.

WETH is also available as an OFT on Kava via Stargate, and WBTC will soon be issued natively on Kava by Bitgo as well. This provides a plethora of native asset markets for Aave on Kava with deep liquidity.

Some other bluechip deployments on Kava include Curve Finance, Beefy Finance, and an upcoming deployment from Yearn Finance as well.

Kava’s latest partnership with Tether, Bitgo, LayerZero and other DApps mentioned above signify its steady commitment to provide a top of the line DeFi ecosystem to users.

One unique benefit of an Aave v3 deployment on Kava is that Aave would be able to open up Cosmos based markets like ATOM natively on the EVM, which is currently not available on any other chain. We believe this opportunity to open up the Cosmos world to Aave presents a significant opportunity for the community.

# Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:

The Kava Foundation has done a good job of managing its treasury in this recent bear market. Currently the treasury stands at ~360M Kava. The Foundation is happy to seed liquidity in initial markets with up to 50M Kava over the first year.

As mentioned previously, the Kava Rise reward program exists to reward protocols pro-rata based on the amount TVL each project has on a monthly basis. With the commitment to seed liquidity, and the market opportunity for Aave to overtake the soon-to-be deprecated existing Kava Lend protocol, Aave has a clear opportunity to establish TVL and market dominance within the Kava ecosystem, and thereby earn a significant portion of existing 1M Kava/month liquidity mining rewards.

In short, not only will Kava Foundation commit to seeding liquidity, but that seeded liquidity will also drive the flywheel of liquidity mining rewards for Aave users on Kava.

Regardless of TVL, at a bare minimum, the Kava Foundation will commit to 1M Kava in liquidity mining rewards over the first year for the Aave community. It is completely up to the Aave community how it wants to use these rewards.

*About Kava Rise Program*

Kava Rise is an on-chain reward program that rewards builders on Kava. Rewards are distributed monthly on a pro-rata basis on the amount of TVL each project has. The current reward distribution is 1M Kava per month. And this amount can change/increase based on governance as the ecosystem continues to mature.

190,"In 2019, the first version of the Aave protocol smart contracts (the “Aave Protocol”) were deployed to the Ethereum mainnet. V1 of the Aave Protocol provided a way for users to provide and obtain liquidity autonomously, and to earn yield on any liquidity provided to the protocol.   

In December 2020, a second version of the Aave Protocol was deployed, which brought new features to liquidity provision and liquidity access in the DeFi ecosystem. V2 of the Aave Protocol featured, among other things, credit delegation, the ability for users to choose between stable and variable interest rates on any borrow transaction and certain gas optimizations and improvements.   

Around the same time, Aave Governance gained administration and maintenance over V1 and V2 of the Aave Protocol, and were tasked with the continued growth of the ecosystem around the Aave Protocol (the “Aave Ecosystem”). 

The Aave Ecosystem has grown organically over the past two years, supporting successful, safe and risk conscious operation of the Aave Protocol.  The community has supported the Aave Protocol’s expansion from the Ethereum mainnet to the Polygon and Avalanche networks as well. 

After these two years of substantial growth, this snapshot proposal to the Aave Governance seeks community approval for a new iteration of the Aave Protocol: Introducing Aave V3. 👻 🎉 

The features associated with Aave V3 represent a significant technological advancement from DeFi liquidity protocols as we know them today. 

Aave V3 introduces the following features (among others):  

- Portal: allows assets to seamlessly flow between Aave V3 markets over different networks; 

- High Efficiency Mode: allows borrowers to extract the highest borrowing power out of their collateral;  

- Isolation Mode: limits exposure and risks to the protocol from newly listed assets by only permitting borrowing up to a specific debt ceiling;  

- Risk Management Improvements: provides additional protection for the protocol through various risk caps and other tools;  

-  L2-Specific Features: designs specific to Layer 2 networks to improve user experience and reliability;  

-  Community Contribution: facilitates and incentivizes community usage through a modular, well organized codebase. 

These features make V3 the most robust and efficient DeFi liquidity protocol ever designed. 

In the event that the community votes affirmatively, the Aave Protocol V3 codebase audits being conducted by OpenZeppelin, Trail Of Bits, Peckshield, ABDK and Certora will be completed in or around the end of November. In addition, certain auditors may apply to the DAO to conduct additional audits of the code upon release before deployment. 

If the community votes positively for deployment of V3 of the Aave Protocol, there will be a set of additional Snapshot votes for the community to determine the following: 

- Deployment Networks:  Given the proliferation of efficient networks, including L2s, the community can vote on which networks V3 will be released initially.  V3 will be able to be deployed on a maximum of three networks upon release, so the Snapshot will be a “ranking” vote. 

- The V3 code licensing: In light of the fact that the Aave Ecosystem is highly diffuse and decentralized, Aave Governance will decide what type of license, if any, will apply to the Aave Protocol V3 code.  As far as we are aware, this is a first for the DeFi space! 

- The V3 Bug Bounty program: The community will decide on size, duration and scope of the Bug Bounty program, as well as who (e.g., the RiskDAO, etc. – see proposal here [insert RiskDAO governane proposal]) will administer the program. 

- Retroactive funding:  The community will also be able to decide whether to provide retroactive funding to those who contributed to the creation of V3, and how much funding to provide.   

If the community votes to deploy V3, another ARC will provide additional details relating to each of the additional votes described above. 

Once these votes determine the community decisions and the current audits are finalized, the deployments voted upon by the community can begin.

**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)


# Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.

# About Jarvis Network
Synthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.

jFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.

The protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.

We have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).

Combined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).

We also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.

jEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.

We debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.

The protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:

- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).
- $78M of volume on our primary market.
- 33k swaps by 9k users.
- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).
- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).
- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.
- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.

# Benefits for Aave V3
### Fiat on and off-ramp
jEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.

We have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).

Having jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.

### Large addressable market
A part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).

### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins
jEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.

### DDM
jEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.

### Low risk collateral
As collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.

jEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.

jEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.


# Risk Parameters
With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:

1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.

# Security specification and risks

### Risks inherent to jEUR
Besides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.

jEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.


[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)


### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.
jEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.

There is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.

It does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.

##### TLDR : This proposal aims to present the ApeCoinDAO brand and weekly AIP updates on well-respected 3rd party Twitter Spaces to reach new audiences. This proposal aims to leverage Twitter Spaces as a resource to raise awareness about the ApeCoin ecosystem.

By educating new users about the ApeCoin DAO through regular Web 3.0 focused Twitter Spaces, we encourage community engagement and aim to onboard thousands of potential new members.

This effort will be instrumental in increasing participation and the number of stakeholders invested in the governance of the project, which adds to the further decentralisation of the DAO.

dNFTs more like damn, NFTs 

We’ll use on chain data from Dynamic NFTs connected to Chainlink’s oracle to track KPIs and performance metrics. These NFTs will go through stages of Evolution, reflecting acknowledged contributions. This data and feedback from the pilot will inform their potential use across the entire DAO.
More about it in the dedicated section
Check this out : [ApeCoin Tracker](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/apecoin-tracker-tracking-anon-txns-wrt-the-treasury/11591)

##### Brief Overview :
* This proposal is for a 60-day trial-run to provide a weekly ApeCoinDAO update across multiple Web3/NFT Twitter Spaces deemed the best audience-DAO-culture-fit.
* By reaching new users through regular Web3 focused Twitter Spaces, we encourage curiosity and onboard hundreds of potential builders, creators, artists and other NFT communities to the DAO.
* This effort is instrumental in increasing participation and the overall number of stakeholders invested in the governance of the project, which adds to the further decentralisation of the DAO.
* This proposal requests a grant of UP TO 15,000 ApeCoin tokens to go directly to 10-15 Twitter Spaces and their teams as a Scholarship for an initial trial period of 60 days (approximately 60 appearances).

We are shooting for 5 spaces in the first month at up to 1000 APE each, which’ll be scaled up to 10 in the 2nd month.

Obligatory “Up to” cause some spaces will be much less, some would be sponsored giveaways and the better ones will be Scholarship based.

#### OVERALL COST 

The maximum cost for this proposal over its 60 day running period (including giveaways, scholarships and partnerships) is estimated to be up to 15,000 ape with a max cap of 1000 ape per space

The funds will be transferred by the treasury directly to the Creators without the need for external management. This ensures no misappropriation of DAO funds can take place.

We’ll start with 5 spaces in the first month and scale it upto 10 spaces in the following month.
* May - working budget of 5,000 APE
* June - working budget of 10,000 APE

For comparison: Rug Radio costs approx. $5k USD for a single appearance Nifty Portal costs approx. $10k USD for a month of once weekly updates read by a team member

###### Total Request is 15,000 APE for 60 Days

203,"#### ABSTRACT

The ApeCoin DAO is built on the fundamental goal of enabling Yugaverse and ApeCoin holders with value. To date, the focus has been enabling marketplaces, communications, IRL events/education, and physical assets. We believe a DEX can be the next big thing.
ApeCoin itself is trading on most major CEXs and DEXs (centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges). There are a wide range of fees charged by these exchanges associated with opening and closing positions, and conducting swaps.
Our vision is to create an ApeCoin DAO decentralized exchange (DEX) to benefit ApeCoin holders. The ApeCoin DAO DEX will enable the decentralized exchange of ERC-20 tokens supported by multi-asset pools that earn liquidity providers fees from market making and swap fees. We expect to help create the lowest possible trading fees available in all of DeFI for $APE holders, stakers, and buyers.
Our core contract functionality will include rewarding LP providers in $APE, thus creating an important use-case around utility for $APE and activating significant deflationary pressure on the token. The impact should be greater utility, engagement, and value for our DAO.

## Protocol Description:

Mellow LRT is an innovative liquid restaking primitive allowing permissionless creation of modular LRTs. Mellow offers a series of vault smart contracts tailored to different risk profiles, managed by LRT curators. For more information, please see [here](https://docs.mellow.finance/mellow-lrt-primitive/overview).

Mellow has more than 41,000 stETH worth of assets restaked across 4 LRTs curated by P2P (rstETH), Steakhouse (steakLRT), re7 (Re7LRT), and MEV Capital (amphrETH). The protocol quickly reached its cap limits after it launched in mid June 2024. In addition, it recently opened two Ethena related vaults (sUSDe and ENA) and generated an additional 37.5M sUSDe and 23.3M ENA.

## Motivation:

Mellow is seeking to establish the amphrETH/rstETH/Re7LRT/steakLRT/wstETH on Balancer to develop liquidity for its stETH backed LRTs. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Mellow community.

## Specifications:

1. Governance: Mellow currently operates with a multi-sig with [publicly](https://research.lido.fi/t/mellow-lido-alliance-proposal/7557/19) verified signers. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance as soon as required research and preparations are made.

2. Oracles: Mellow is working with RedStone to create price feeds for its LRTs.

3. Audits: Mellow collaborates with renowned security experts and audit firms, including Chainsecurity, Statemind, and Spearbit, and we only release code to production after it has passed external audits.

  1. Statemind Report: https://github.com/mellow-finance/mellow-lrt/blob/dev-symbiotic-deploy/audits/202406_Statemind/Mellow%20LRT%20report%20with%20deployment.pdf
  2. Second audit to be announced
  3. Community audit https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/423

4. Centralization vectors: Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via 24h timelocked proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.

5. Market History: Mellow has seen significant growth in TVL since launching in mid June with over 41k ETH across its 4 LRTs. Mellow

6. Value: The balancer pool is the first DEX liquidity pool for Mellow LRTs and is aimed at providing liquidity to its growing community. Mellow is committed to support LPs with a 2x points boost.

The balancer pools are already live and are available on Ethereum:

**Summary:**
THX Network is updating its tokenomics to a voted escrow model with the launch of $veTHX. For this, we’re working with the [8020 Launchpad Initiative](https://www.ve8020.xyz/) funded by [Balancer Grants](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/7d33d4a52c604b719958ab7ff8f1389e?v=2975616ba49e4dd88550c817e23505f9&p=cc4d3268889d419aa76a447be3cb22dc±=c). An [early preview of the $THX staking interface](https://gov.thx.network/t/staking-feedback/70) is available for feedback.

We kindly ask to re-approve the THX/USDC gauge on the 80/20 pool. This pool's staked BPT tokens will form the basis for $veTHX, the new governance token for THX DAO, and also will be the main source of $THX liquidity.

Ps. While with the introduction of BIP-19 the THX DAO created a 50/50 THX/stMATIC ‘core pool’ to align with the Balancer’s long term goals, the tokenomics transition to the voted escrow model makes the 50/50 pool obsolete.

**Protocol Description:**

THX Network helps communities grow using automated quests and rewards. Unlike other reward solutions you embed the quest in your game or app, using your own branding. Users don’t have to go to a third party platform! $THX is the protocol's governance token and it’s active on both Polygon and Ethereum mainnet.

The project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under agreement No 82888 (Blockpool) and No 824509 (Block.IS). And is part of the Techstars + ABN AMRO Future of Finance Amsterdam 2022 cohort.

**Motivation:**

* Staked tokens from the 80/20 THX/USDC pool will become the new governance token for THX Network ([UI preview](https://gov.thx.network/t/staking-feedback/70))
* THX Network is working with Protofire.io (funded by a Balancer grant) as a launching user of the ve Launchpad
* The 80/20 THX/USDC pool is the primary source of $THX liquidity, created after the first Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) launch using Copper on Polygon working closely with Alchemist and Copper team members at the time (dec. 2021)
* The 80/20 pool has had up to 0.3% of the vote
* The 50/50 THX/stMATIC pool was established so that it aligns with the BIP19 initiative and can have the ‘core pool’ status, see forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-102-enable-the-thx-stmatic-gauge-on-polygon-with-2-cap/3892

**THX Network DAO and $BAL**
THX DAO has acquired $BAL and has its multisig address (0x4a30c80A2c41312ce4ee79f730C8D84cAD9f7B31) whitelisted for governance.

**Specifications:**
1. **Governance**: DAO multisig 3 out of 4 with two being controlled by core team members employed by THX Network BV (limited company, established 2021, The Netherlands) and two from external community members:
*matic:0x14d4D5CA3Cc67879168dEC88aB018975B24E214b

The multisig addresses control the $THX token allocations and the Treasury liquidity. 

2. **Oracles**: no external oracles are used.

3. **Audits**: docs[.]thx.network/other/audits

4. **Centralization vectors**:
Our Campaign Contracts used by customers utilizing our campaign software can at the moment only be controlled by our OpenZeppelin Relay account in order to cover gas costs and offer a frictionless UX for campaign participants.
Context and mitigation:
We are migrating these contracts towards a Safe based architecture where, similar to our current (Safe based) self-custodial wallet architecture, a Web3Auth MPC key will be used to register the account as a signer on the Safe. Next to that we register our OpenZeppelin Relay account as a signer which will be responsible for both transaction initiation sign-in and execution.

5. **Market History**: the $THX token launched at $0.12 and currently sits at $0.04. The pool has been active since dec. 2021 and generated $2.9M in volume since then. It has about $500k in TVL.

6. **Value**: The 80/20 THX/USDC pool is the primary source of $THX liquidity. The pool used to rank number #10 by TVL and fees collected on Polygon.
Since the inception of the 50/50 pool the 80/20 pool has become less central to our ecosystem. However, going forward with the routing of all liquidity incentives, protocol fees and governance power through the 80/20 pool we expect it to significantly grow in TVL, volume and fees.

210,"This proposal originally appeared on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799) and is faithfully reproduced here along with all proposed amendments.

# The Proposal
For the remaining two weeks of the [exchange gas reimbursement pilot](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705), expand the list of eligible tokens to include all whitelisted tokens (the same list that is eligible for BAL liquidity mining). The change would take effect starting at 00:00 UTC on Monday, February 8, and we would continue to allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy.

# Motivation
The pilot program has gone very smoothly so far, with 929 BAL being distributed to 441 addresses for the first week. Of these addresses, only 171 were LPs also participating in liquidity mining, meaning the other 270 were traders who gained the opportunity to participate alongside LPs in the ongoing distribution of BAL tokens. The second week of the pilot is not yet finished, but so far 1043 BAL are set to be distributed to 433 addresses, 342 of which are _not_ participating in liquidity mining. Only 86 reimbursed addresses are included in both weeks so far, meaning a total of 788 unique addresses have been or will be reimbursed.

For all of us in the Balancer community, the decentralized distribution of governance power  has always been a top priority. The liquidity mining program features an extensive list of over **400** eligible tokens and has been a key contributor to this decentralization, distributing BAL tokens to over **9,000** liquidity providers last week. In contrast, the gas reimbursement pilot so far has only included 5 eligible tokens in order to assess feasibility and reduce gameability at the outset.

But now that the basic, five-token version of the pilot has been validated, it is time to expand it to achieve the same degree of decentralization as the liquidity mining program. To ensure lasting robustness of the governance process, we need to get BAL tokens into the hands of as many Balancer users as possible; and that includes both liquidity providers and traders.

# Mechanics
The overarching mechanics of the gas reimbursement pilot would not change. Please see the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705) for details.

In lieu of the shortlist of eligible tokens included in the original proposal, we would use the existing [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json) used for liquidity mining. Swaps between any two of the tokens on the whitelist would be eligible for reimbursement of gas costs, with limits described in the original post and summarized here:

* Only transactions between an EOA account and the Balancer Exchange Proxy would be eligible. This roughly correlates to end users navigating the [Balancer Exchange UI](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap) and would not include DEX aggregators or most arbitrage bots.
* The maximum amount of gas to be reimbursed would be 100,000 units per swap, where there can be more than one swap in a single transaction (a swap is one leg of a multi-hop trade).
* The maximum gas price (in gwei) used would be the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block.
* Reimbursements would be made in BAL, not ETH, with the median BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko for the weekly period being used to convert.
* If the number of tokens to be distributed in a single week exceeds the 7,500 BAL budget, all reimbursements would be scaled down proportionally so that exactly 7,500 BAL are issued in total.
* Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.

# Amendment 1
If we detect any gaming of the reimbursement program, such as blatant wash trading, we would reserve the right to filter those addresses out of the distribution. We want this to be an opportunity for traders to safely utilize the Balancer Exchange without fear of having their reimbursements diluted by an attacker.",bearish
211,"CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from Lazio Fan Token, the official Binance Fan Token for S.S. Lazio designed to revolutionize the fan experience for all S.S. Lazio supporters.

212,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to BNB Chain v3 Farm Rewards

As we continue to optimize CAKE rewards across all of our deployments, we are able to gradually lower the overall CAKE emission, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate a smooth trading experience. Ultimately, this enables us to contribute a greater amount of CAKE towards the weekly burn. 

The previous round of [**Adjustments to Farm Rewards**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x411b3e231d1da0c21890580449328c9a5a9cc50d1d0c7a33daab90df584779a4) increased the overall CAKE burn by approximately **1,700 CAKE per day** with minimal impact to trading volumes.

Given the traction and overall market share shown on our BNB Chain v3 deployments, this proposal aims to decrease emissions to the farms listed below and increase the overall CAKE burn by approximately **680 CAKE per day**.

These optimizations will add up over the coming months to 1) improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across farms and 2) redirect CAKE rewards towards the highest growth farms, ultimately accelerating the path towards ultrasound CAKE.

#### Adjustment Details

With the above in mind, we are proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below. Note, all other BNB Chain v3 farms will continue to earn the same level of rewards and even with these adjustments, the farms below will continue to have a healthy level of liquidity, volume, and APR.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their average daily volume, 14-day volume, capital efficiency, and alternatives available.

## Background
The [v4 Weighted Pool Factory](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20230320-weighted-pool-v4) and the [v4 Composable Stable Pool Factory](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20230320-composable-stable-pool-v4) were deployed to allow the use of `create2` instead of `create`. The [v2 Managed Pool Factory](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20230411-managed-pool-v2) allows using `create2`, adds reentrancy protection, and has various other improvements. Some initial ""wire-up"" of permissions is required to bring them into standard function.  This BIP lays out these changes and requests permission to apply them.

217,"#### Proposal to Redirect Multichain Warchest to CAKE Burn

One year ago, PancakeSwap embarked beyond BNB Chain to further our vision of enabling the smoothest and most user-friendly DeFi journey for everyone. A key part of this was expanding across multiple chains and utilizing a [**Multichain Warchest**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/bafkreigzab36tzr4d46jf72isgxqtejcoirnmrifxsxio7ggxwb2rmtnte) to bootstrap liquidity across each deployment.

Since then, we’ve successfully expanded support to 8 chains, including: BNB Chain, Ethereum, Polygon zkEVM, zkSync Era, Arbitrum, Linea, Base, and Aptos.

Now that the initial goals of the Multichain Warchest have been accomplished and we approach ultrasound CAKE, this proposal aims to reduce CAKE emissions towards PancakeSwap’s Multichain Warchest and, instead, redirect these emissions towards CAKE burn.

#### Adjustment Details:
With the above in mind, we propose the following adjustments to CAKE emissions:
- **Current Multichain Warchest Allocation:** 0.6 CAKE per block (17,280 CAKE per day)
- **Proposed Multichain Warchest Allocation:**  0.2 CAKE per block (5,760 CAKE per day)
- **Proposed Increase in CAKE Burn:** 0.4 CAKE per block (11,520 CAKE per day)

Notably, the Multichain Warchest currently has accrued **~3M CAKE**. If this proposal passes, that portion accrued thus far will be minted and directed towards the next CAKE burn.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/0hQx93M.png)

As appropriate, we will continue to enable additional expansions to new chains and develop new products. The Kitchen believes this revised allocation will be sufficient going forward to sustain growth across any existing and new deployments. This enables PancakeSwap to achieve ultrasound CAKE at a much rapid rate.

Lastly, further farm optimizations and reductions such as our most recent [**Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x1ddc1d9bc9e791f3ee2152c3e5678cbcacc776612dfe2a3593332f36fbafe9a9) will continue to either: directly increase the CAKE burn, or be redirected to the Multichain Warchest in anticipation of new liquidity efforts or product launches.

Ultimately the above changes will increase the overall CAKE burn, while continuing to provide the best DeFi experience.  

# Timeline

1️⃣ This Proposal is submitted (22 September 2023)

2️⃣ PancakeSwap reduces the emissions to the Multichain Warchest and increases the CAKE burn (if the proposal is successful)

This is a proposal to raise the liquidity mining cap from $100M to uncapped for $AAVE

# The Proposal

After the activation of the Balancer Based Safety Module 20 Days ago, the liquidity for $AAVE quickly grew to be the Largest Balancer protocol Liquidity Pool as new LPs join the AAVE/BAL incentivized Safety Module.

![image|690x101](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/464af158056f0a77cbf50195bfc2bb8a987826c1.png) 

Current APY by staking in the Safety Module is 29.34%, only considering the AAVE rewards, The Pool is still growing and Balancer is now the best protocol to swap AAVE onchain.

As BAL is a collateral option in Aave, aBPT stakers can use their BAL rewards to unlock more borrowing power in the Aave Protocol.

Uncapping the BAL rewards for the AAVE/ETH pool will allows even further incentive to bring more liquidity onchain and increase the synergies between the Aave & Balancer protocols.

# What is The Safety Module?

The Aave Safety Module acts as a collateral for the whole Aave ecosystem. AAVE holders, and now - with the new Balancer Based Stake - AAVE/ETH holders benefit from long term rewards for securing the protocol from insolvency, while at the same time bearing the risk of being slashed in case of shortfall events.
Having a very liquid onchain market and a consistent capital allocated in the Safety Module greatly increases the safety of the Aave ecosystem and the Aave protocol liquidity providers.",bullish
219,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Zebec Protocol ($ZBC) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Zebec Protocol! 

Zebec Protocol is a continuous settlement protocol on the BNB Chain. The protocol enables continuous, real-time money streams, and uses ZBC as its governance token.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn ZBC tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 18,182,000 ZBC
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 19 Dec 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 17 Feb 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 10.52 ZBC

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the ZBC Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a ZBC-CAKE farm.  


The farm will have 0.2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.1x rewards after that. At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1200 UTC on 17 Feb 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.1x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $ZBC?

From the team: “ZBC is the governance token of the Zebec Protocol. It serves two main use cases within the Zebec Ecosystem. 

* ZBC staking allows holders to access Zebec's Product Suite for free and earn cashback when using the Zebec Card. 
* ZBC will be used to pay for transactions in the Zebec Blockchain and as the reward token for Zepoch Node holders and network participants

Forum post: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-mai-on-aave-v3/7630

Proposal to add support for MAI (aka miMatic) on Aave V3 (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche)

### Summary

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom. It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.

All accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.

There’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.

### Risk Parameters

* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain

### Specifications

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Core team at QiDao Protocol.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.

MAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.

Despite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.

MAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.

3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
Being the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.

MAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.

MAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.
* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance
* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.

5. How is the asset currently used?

* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)
* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap
* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon
* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM
* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties
* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave

6. Emission schedule

Users can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.

7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

All funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users
There is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences
The multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.
Since the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.

8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

* Market Cap: ~$250M
* 24h Volume: >$40M
* Volatility: Low
* Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose
* Maturity: Launched 5/4/21

224,"Summary:

dForce proposes to add a dToken pool (dUSDx/dDAI/dUSDC/dUSDT). dToken is a yield aggregator launched by dForce, featured by harvesting the highest underlying yield in the market (USDT 12.1% APY, USDC 6.1% APY, DAI 12.1% APY, as of 31 Aug), as well as gas optimization through a set of strategies that is anticipated to save at least 60% of gas consumption associated (compared to direct interactions with underlying lending protocol for asset supply and sale of governance token mined).
Currently, dToken pool participants can farm DF token by staking through dForce Staking Portal (https://staking.dforce.network/) (mining APY 109% for USDx/USDC on Uniswap), by adding a dToken pool on Curve, LPs could provide liquidity and have the benefit of mining both DF and CRV, (i.e with projected combined yield of 170%), which is a great additional yield incentive to LPs on Curve.

======

RPL appears to be a coin with a purpose and a real use case.
The $26,465,785 70 RPL - 30 WETH pool is one of the biggest on Balancer and earns BAL at a rate of $10m worth of BAL/year.

Unfortunately it generates very little volume with 24h volumes oscilating in low tens of thousands of USD, last 24h volume: $30,891

A $2m pool would be enough to facilitate low slippage trading for such volumes so I propose reducing the BAL rewards cap to reduce from 10m *to 3m*. I think that the $10m yearly worth of rewards could be used to encourage other, more useful liquidity.

On top of the low trading volumes and low interest from traders, my subjective opinion is that the valuation is artificially inflated, I’m not happy about heavy concentration of this pool in hands of a single liquidity provider (90% single LP, recently >97%). CMC shows that this coin trades >$900k on Bilaxy and >300k on LBank within 24h which I find hard to believe. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rocket-pool/markets",bullish

This is a proposal to allocate some small portion of the Balancer ecosystem grant fund toward public goods.

We developers and community members of the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement recognize that, more often than not, we stand on the shoulders of giants. Decentralized Finance (DeFi), as well as the wider Ethereum and cryptoasset ecosystem, is a group effort and we can all do our part to make this technological revolution a reality. As a core building block within DeFi, the Balancer protocol directly benefits from any and all growth within the DeFi economy. As such, it would behoove us all to give back to the community that has enabled Balancer’s unparalleled growth over the last several months. Let’s help plant the seeds for some of next big Ethereum projects.

[Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/?) Round 7 began three days ago on September 15 and will run until October 2. Let’s get this proposal passed this weekend so that the Balancer community can become a matching partner for this round!

The following are the proposed options for a lump sum public goods contribution to Gitcoin Grants Round 7. The BAL tokens to be donated will be taken from the Balancer ecosystem grant fund.

The idea is, reward with some progressive percentage to someone who holds CAKE and provide liquidity for pools or farm.

Who holds CAKE gets rewarded with extra percentage on the profit of the liquidity pools.

Here we add value and usage for the coin and a exponencial percentage to who make the liquidity and holds CAKE at same time.

The increase of the demand will appear just in the beginning of this idea, and forces market makers to holds the coin for more profit in the swap of the liquidity pools. 

This will generate something really useful for the token.

# Summary:

Enable a Balancer gauge for the wUSK/paUSD/USDC (e-cs-kp-usd) composable stable pool with a 2% cap on Ethereum.

wUSK is an erc-4626 wrapper of USK, USK is a KUMA interest-bearing token (KIBTs) backed by KUMA NFTs, themselves backed by US 12 months T-Bills, issued by the KUMA Protocol.

paUSD is crypto-backed USD stablecoin issued by the Parallel Protocol.

USDC is a stablecoin issued by Circle, a cryptocurrency backed by U.S. dollars or dollar-denominated assets like U.S. Treasury securities. USDC's reserve assets are held in segregated accounts with regulated U.S. financial institutions.

* Audits: https://docs.kuma.bond/kuma-protocol/ressources/security-and-audits

# Protocol Description:

### KUMA

The KUMA Protocol results from the work of two distinct organizations: Mimo Capital AG and the KUMA Protocol.

* Mimo Capital AG, a Liechtenstein regulated and licensed company, audited by [Grant Thornton](https://www.grantthornton.global/en/) issues tokens backed by bonds (KUMA NFTs) using NFT technology (underlying bonds are held by [Bank Frick & Co. AG](https://www.bankfrick.li/en)) to authorized individuals/companies (KYC/KYB).

* The KUMA Protocol is a decentralized entity governed by vMIMO token holders that leverages these NFTs and issues KUMA interest-bearing tokens (KIBTs), which are freely transferable erc-20 tokens. These interest-bearing tokens behave similarly to stablecoins whose balance increases automatically.

Currently, 3 KIBTs are deployed on Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Mantle & Linea:

* FRK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFT, themselves backed by 357 days French T-Bills. (± 3,35% APR)
* USK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFTs, themselves backed by US 12 months T-Bills. (± 4,5% APR)
* EGK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFT, themselves backed by 740 days Next.e.GO Mobile SE Corporate Bonds. (± 8,75% APR)

### Parallel Protocol

The Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol) is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon PoS and Fantom. Stablecoins (PAR & paUSD) are decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro/USD fiat currency.

# Motivation:

The role of the e-cs-kp-usd pool is to increase the stability of paUSD and wUSK (1), the on-chain liquidity of both paUSD and wUSK (2), connect the Parallel and KUMA ecosystems (3) and providing a fiat gateway to paUSD & wUSK holders on Ethereum (4). Together, these 4 points allow for building a Bonds DeFi ecosystem.

1. paUSD & wUSK peg:

* paUSD is issued following the CDP model; if paUSD trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy paUSD cheaper and repay their debt; if paUSD trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow paUSD and sell them at a higher price; since wUSK can be exchanged for Bonds NFT, and can be sold for real USD, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and USD market to help maintain the paUSD peg; so if paUSD trades below or above its peg, anyone can perform an arbitrage without having to go through a CDP.
* wUSK is an erc-4626 wrapper of USK. USK is issued by using the “swap” function on the KUMA Protocol, each USK are backed by Treasury Bonds NFT, if the peg is below the real price, KYC/KYB people are incentivized to buy USK and redeem the NFT, if the price is above the peg, NFT holders are incentivized to mint USK and sell them.

2. On-chain liquidity:
Since paUSD can be exchanged for USDC and wUSK which are redeemable for USD. Users can swap paUSD for wUSK and/or USDC then USD by buying/selling KUMA NFTs and/or redeem USDC for USD to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa.
3. Connect ecosystems:
The wUSK/paUSD/USDC pool connects Parallel and its paUSD (essentially a way to borrow USD with various collateral) to KUMA and its wUSK (providing onchain US T-bills), enabling multiple use cases.

* DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: USK has a direct fiat on and off-ramp by buying/selling underlying KUMA NFTs.
* It would also connect paUSD holders to the KUMA Bonds NFTs ecosystems.

### A few notes:

* PAR (the Parallel EURO stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Polygon: [2eur (PAR)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x513cdee00251f39de280d9e5f771a6eafebcc88e000000000000000000000a6b)
* Mimo Labs has started building [positions](https://debank.com/profile/0x4a266739E40664e80470CC335120a2A1fA0B3F3f) in AURA (±175k $vlAURA) & BAL and the Parallel Protocol [treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b) currently holds 21k $vlAURA.
* Mimo Labs is buying ±$25k AURA per month which are locked to incentivize the liquidity.
* The Parallel DAO will also pay ±$1.5k voting incentives per week using the Paladin Quest vote marketplace to the pool (more details [here](https://gov.mimo.capital/t/mgp-14-adjust-mimo-tokens-incentives-repartition-on-ethereum-polygon-pos/292))

title: [ARFC] Safety Module - Polygon & Avalanche Coverage Update
author: @TokenLogic
created: 2023-09-03

---

# Summary

This publication proposes updating the Safety Module (SM) coverage across the various iterations of Aave Protocol on Polygon and Avalanche networks.

SM coverage is to be removed from Polygon v2 and Avalanche v2 deployments and extended to Avalanche v3.

# Motivation

With the continued migration of users from v2 to v3, this publication seeks to further encourage users to migrate by removing the SM coverage for Aave v2 deployments on the Polygon and Avalanche networks.

During 2023, the total market size on Avalanche and Polygon Aave v2 Protocol deployments has been trending lower. At the time of writing the total market size of Aave v2 on Avalanche and Polygon is $36.2M and $134.7M respectively. For comparison, the Aave v3 deployment on each network is $199.8M and $229.9M respectively. 

By removing SM coverage for Avalanche and Polygon v2 deployments, Aave DAO will no longer be providing coverage for the outdated iterations of Aave Protocol with exception of the Aave ARC deployment. By removing the SM coverage, users are further encouraged to migrate to v3.

The Polygon Aave v3 deployment is already covered by the SM whilst the Avalanche v3 deployment is not cover by the SM. This publication seeks to extend the SM coverage to include Avalanche v3. Therefore both v3 iterations are covered by the SM and v2 iterations are not covered on Polygon and Avalanche. 

For reference, at the time of writing, the following Aave Protocol deployments are covered by the SM:

* Ethereum v2
* [Ethereum v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2cbfeb5c5329c4d1720dbae4045386fceb2d2a9bd5b42a81cee47ea5c934f491)

244,"Request for feedback: Options for tBTC pools

Discussion: https://gov.curve.fi/t/request-for-feedback-options-for-tbtc-pools/841

The tBTC team proposes adding a tBTC/wBTC or tBTC/[renBTC/sBTC/wBTC] pool. Adding a tBTC pool will further increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum and make it easier to swap between assets.

Abstract

tBTC is a Bitcoin sidechain on Ethereum, built to give Bitcoin the capabilities of Ethereum and bring additional collateral to DeFi. The asset (TBTC) is an ERC-20 pegged to Bitcoin, it can be minted or redeemed for BTC by anyone and without intermediaries. Instead of relying on a single custodian like wBTC or federation of custodians like Liquid, tBTC is supported by a decentralized bonded multi-federated peg model using ECDSA technology.

tBTC is built on the Keep Network, and as of launching this week already has 24.21M USD locked in the network (22.69M USD in KEEP, 1.39M USD in ETH and 0.26M USD in BTC). We’ve decided to launch slowly and safely with a 9 week graduated cap, currently the cap is at 100 BTC but will rise to 250 later this week. [See the full schedule here](https://blog.keep.network/tbtc-the-safe-way-to-use-bitcoin-in-defi-is-live-on-tbtc-network-de2bb8b6eaf7). Future plans for tBTC include pointing at least 5% of the KEEP supply at various liquidity rewards.

Motivation

With several BTC on Ethereum choices out there, the tBTC team wants to gauge the Curve community’s appetite for a tBTC pool. Our team’s initial thought was to keep it simple with a tBTC/wBTC pool, but are also interested in hearing about interest in something like a tBTC/[renBTC/wBTC/sBTC] pool.

Please vote below or submit options for other assets you’d like to see in a pool.

Specification

The tBTC contracts just went live: https://etherscan.io/token/0x8dAEBADE922dF735c38C80C7eBD708Af50815fAa

tBTC is fully open source and has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence, Sergei Delgado (an independent BTC researcher) and Trail of Bits. [See audit details](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc#security)

For
More pool options for Bitcoin on Ethereum will bootstrap liquidity as this tokenized Bitcoin grows as a whole.

247,"#### Proposal to Reduce CAKE Token Total Supply

Over the past year, PancakeSwap has significantly revamped its tokenomics, emissions, and growth strategy. Starting from improving [**CAKE Tokenomics v2.5**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x707643dd2c2b941c7274f26a0362922198912e8549050ae9f2d1d9d71ada04bb) to most recently launching the [**veCAKE Gauges System**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), CAKE is in a position to pursue further growth across all deployments.

Now that CAKE has achieved consistent deflation for several months and is focusing on accelerating our journey to ultrasound CAKE, this proposal aims to reduce the CAKE token’s total supply to a **maximum cap of 450M CAKE**. 

With a current **total supply of 388M CAKE**, the Kitchen believes this new and lower cap will be sufficient to gain market share across all chains and sustain the veCAKE model.

![](https://imgur.com/kGk5kri.png)


#### Proposal Rationale:
There are several strong reasons to implement this adjustment:
- **Certainty for the community on future CAKE token supply**: 

When PancakeSwap launched in 2021, to ensure that there were sufficient incentives to bootstrap the ecosystem, there was significant token inflation. After almost 3 years in development, we now have more accurate estimations of incentives required to achieve our growth targets.

- **Accelerate the journey to ultrasound CAKE**: 

Total supply is an important metric when understanding the impact of token burns and future emissions. Lowering this number is a critical step to achieve ultrasound CAKE and enables us to send a clear signal of PancakeSwap’s pivot away from a hyperinflationary tokenomics model.

- **Ensure sufficient flexibility for growth**: 

450M CAKE is a reasonable new cap as it  ensures sufficient supply for future growth (e.g., gaining market share on Ethereum, Ethereum L2s, and new initiatives like position managers)


#### Adjustment Details:
With the above in mind, we propose the following adjustments to CAKE total supply:
- **Current Total Supply:** 750,000,000 CAKE
- **Future Total Supply:** 450,000,000 CAKE
- **CAKE Total Supply Decrease:** -300,000,000 CAKE
- **Implementation steps:** Decrease the max cap on token supply accordingly


Before you vote, please make sure you understand the impact of long and short term effects of CAKE emissions changes on our tokenomics.

title: [ARFC] Ethereum v2 Reserve Factor Adjustment
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic @ChaosLabs
created: 2024-02-27

---

# Summary

This publication proposes periodically increasing the Aave v2 Ethereum Reserve Factor (RF) to encourage users to migrate to Aave v3.

# Motivation

With Aave v3 now crossing the $8 Billion TVL threshold and $3 Billion remaining in Aave v2, this publication seeks to encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3 by increasing the RF.

With all other variables held constant, increasing the RF over time in isolation will result in a reducing deposit rate. Users are encourage to migrate to v3 in search of higher yield.

With market conditions permitting, we propose initiating a periodic 5.00% RF increase across all assets every 14 days as mentioned [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766) up to a threshold of 99.99%. During each increase cycle, we will monitor how users respond and, if any potential risks are identified, the next RF increase will be delayed until it is safe to implement.

Do note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect users' health factor, and this method has already been [implemented on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350) for some time. 

# Specification

The below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.

### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Ape Hospitality Group aims to host a DAO only conference with $ape holders and partner communities under one roof focused on the DAO brand apart from Yuga Labs. There’s a huge misconception that still exist, many people hesitate to get involve with the DAO because they still think its just for BAYC holders. Such conferences without a high barrier of entry will create a more welcoming and IRL impact for all $ape holders.

Through this, people can interact with each other directly as well as various working groups, create bonds and get a wider idea of what we as Apecoin DAO are doing. Everyone (pending capacity) who holds $APE gets to experience the club parties at the hotel. We’ve seen a major fomo among every community outside Bored Apes during Apefest, even with the recent announcement. With this proposal, Ape Hospitality Group aims to make a place for all $ape holders to meet, party and hang out with fellow DAO members. This will help the DAO grow the unique number of holders, and give a sense of belongingness.

The main attraction will be Apecoin DAO panels with different Working Groups (who may opt in to participate), pop-up stalls for MBA licensees and booths.This will be an exclusive DAO conference for community members and builders to get together and interact with each other. Share alphas, create memories and build.

Key Benefits Summary
* Conference and get together for $Ape holders
* Panel discussion
* Networking with a wider $ape ecosystem
* Pop up stalls and booth for MBA products
* Party!


### OVERALL COST 
The total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $300,000 USD to be paid in $APE.

Breakdown:
* Booking: $184,000 (Rooms: $109,000 & Conference Hall: $75,000)
* Media and Entertainment: $50,000
    * Photography/Videography
    * Music/DJ
    * Lights
    * Merchandise
    * Catering
* Operations: $66,000
    * Administration
    * Marketing
    * Contingency
    * Insurance
* Additional costs are included in each implementation step as detailed above.

The AIP covers a 1-night stay for 300 $APE holders, first come first served. The author will check proof of holding $APE for interested people within the DAO.

253,"Overview:
-
\
This proposal aims to cover important smart contract upgrades that will allow for the rescue of user funds, improved pausing functionality and additional safeguards via blacklisting.

This proposal will not cover the **execution** of the proposed rescue function and unpausing. Those items will be addressed later via a future BIP.

Specifics:
-
\
**Upgrade all affected Setts with the following new functionality:**

* add **rescue function** to transfer sett tokens from attacker wallets to recovered.badgerdao.eth (one time use - patchBalance() function)
* add a ‘**global pause**’ feature that allows all Sett contracts to be paused and unpaused simultaneously with the same permissions as current pausing functionality
* add global **blacklist** to block actions, set to the attackers wallets listed below

**Blacklisted Attacker wallets:**

* 0x1FCdb04d0C5364FBd92C73cA8AF9BAA72c269107
* 0xa33B95ea28542Ada32117B60E4F5B4cB7D1Fc19B
* 0x4fbf7701b3078B5bed6F3e64dF3AE09650eE7DE5
* 0x1B1b391D1026A4e3fB7F082ede068B25358a61F2
* 0xEcD91D07b1b6B81d24F2a469de8e47E3fe3050fd
* 0x691dA2826AC32BBF2a4b5d6f2A07CE07552A9A8E
* 0x91d65D67FC573605bCb0b5E39F9ef6E18aFA1586
* 0x0B88A083dc7b8aC2A84eBA02E4acb2e5f2d3063C
* 0x2eF1b70F195fd0432f9C36fB2eF7C99629B0398c
* 0xbbfD8041EbDE22A7f3e19600B4bab4925Cc97f7D
* 0xe06eD65924dB2e7b4c83E07079A424C8a36701E5

**NOTE**: Approval to execute the following actions will be submitted via a future BIP that will undergo the Badger Governance Process:

* Execute the new patchBalances() function to rescue funds from the attacker to the recovery multisig
* Unpausing the Sett contract to resume normal operation

Why is this BIP being expedited?
-
\
Badger is committed to reopening smart contracts as soon as it is safe to do so. Given the timelock considerations, waiting for the standard timeframe before making these upgrades would add a minimum 3 day lag once the final BIP to execute the proposed actions to rescue funds and unpause is decided.

As such, this proposal uncouples the smart contract upgrades from the execution of the rescue action and unpausing so that the execution decision can follow Badger’s governance process, while also ensuring the resulting governance decision can be enacted promptly.

Amended requirements to pass expedited governance proposal:
-
\
Given this BIP will go directly to snapshot, it will require a supermajority of over 70% at a quorum of more than 200,000 votes in order to pass.

Supporting Parameter Changes:
-
\
Additionally, among the older contracts, 1 Sett and 8 Strategy contracts have the Timelock set as their governance address. In order to align them with the rest of the infrastructure, Badger will change their governance to the [devMultisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB65cef03b9B89f99517643226d76e286ee999e77).

This will give Badger the ability to handle unpausing and transferring tokens away from attacker wallets atomically and with agility, which is the preferred technical approach to the situation. Badger intends to propose using the timelock for all key parameter changes as part of the future governance 2.0 initiatives.

Note that the timelock is still needed for upgrades or adding new strategies which are the critical operations that involve handling of user funds.

This transaction will require going through the Timelock process. Once executed, the unpausing of the whole infrastructure will be handled by the devMultisig directly and no timelock will be required for it.

256,"##### ABSTRACT
Ape Express aims to launch the ultimate toolkit for a thriving memecoin ecosystem on ApeChain, empowering users with the tools they need to create, customize and deploy tokens on ApeChain.

With Ape Express no technical skills are needed for safe, unruggable launches. Configure and deploy your token with multiple features in seconds.

Streamlined liquidity management: borrow, deploy, and lock liquidity effortlessly. Developers can deploy an LP using borrowed capital, and launch a coin with a starting market cap of $15K while spending only $300 out of pocket. 
Liquidity loans can be automatically repaid from token taxes, liquidity, or manual payment.

In one place users can create their brand identity, deploy tokens, manage liquidity, build and engage their community. (Think Pump.fun on ApeChain, but way better and less trash. For instance, on Pump.fun tokens start with 1K MC, and never have a chance to reach a DEX. With our system, every launch makes it to the DEX of choice and encourages a free open market on ApeChain.)

Token creators will have an option and be encouraged to airdrop portion of their supply to the holders of the blue chip collections of Yuga ecosystem. BAYC/MAYC/BAKC, CryptoPunks, Kodas, Moonbirds and Mocaverse holders.

This will bring benefit to the holders of these collections and, at the same time, give the upcoming projects an opportunity to reach the high quality user bases that are the lifeblood of these collections.

All of these processes are streamlined in the dapp so that anyone can do it with a few clicks of a button.

This project aims to expand the ApeCoin ecosystem, increase token velocity, TVL and offer new opportunities for the builders in the ApeChain ecosystem.

None of the funds requested in this proposal will be spent on development or team salary. This proposal aims to bootstrap platform liquidity and the Ape Express marketing budget.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
1. Ape Express will give 10% of all gross revenue from platform fees back to the Apecoin DAO’s treasury.
2. Onboarding memecoin degens from other chains and converting this liquidity into $APE.
3. Boosting APE liquidity pairs: Ape Express encourages users to pair their tokens with $APE by automatically converting ETH, USDT, and other assets used on the platform into $APE. By locking APE in LPs we contribute to the overall TVL of the ApeChain.
4. Amplifying on-chain activity: by facilitating fast and easy token creation and trading of memecoins, we drive overall transactions volume. Memecoin trading volume on Solana accounts for $1.2B daily, and over $120M in volume on Base chain. We drive transaction volume to the ApeChain native DEX.
5. Enhancing APE token velocity: gas fees, liquidity loans, and buybacks will all utilize $APE.
6. Backed by The Crypto is a Fun marketing engine. The apes you see above are some of the most prolific memecoin degens in web3. We have our fingers on the pulse of the space and can push our audience over to ApeChain. We run the #1 daily memecoin spaces on CT best believe we will promote ApeChain and Ape Express to the masses.
7. With our novel liquidity loan system we will attract aspiring devs because of the low barrier to entry. They don’t need initial liquidity - they just need a dream and that dog in em

LIST of FEATURES:
1. Token creation
2. Liquidity loans (initial LP)
3. Option to airdrop portion of supply to BAYC/MAYC or other Yuga NFTs.
4. Telegram trading bot - web-facing interface
5. Liquidity lockers
6. Airdrop multi sender
7. Stake APE to earn platform-generated revenue
8. Competitive leaderboard for hot pairs and contest
9. Degen Analytic bots
10. AI Website & brand builder

PLATFORMS & TECHNOLOGIES:
* Smart contracts for deploying tokens
* Smart contracts for lending liquidity & liquidity locker built-in
* Smart contracts and mechanisms for clawing back lent out liquidity

We have created our own set of contracts which interact with each other, giving as much fluidity and flexibility to the system as possible. Users simply pay for token minting, which is dependent on how many features they are including in the token. This acts as initial revenue for the product to safeguard minor expenses with regard to the deploying costs(the user’s token and other related contracts per product deployed), and liquidity rounding errors from the lending activities.

There are several ways for users to repay the loans:
* Direct payment: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, repay a direct 12,500 APE to receive ownership of LP tokens (albeit locked until the lock period is over)
* Tax Tokens: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and passively repay 12,500 APE as taxes are generated from the trading activity of the token. All taxes are diverted to repaying the loan until completed. The creator will then receive ownership of the LP, and release it to their creator’s address when the lock period is over.
* Liquidity Threshold: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and as the liquidity pool grows from net buying activity, a loan with interest is repaid via clawback. This means the user can select a 2x with a 25% interest to repay 12,500 APE when the liquidity pool contains at least 20,000 APE. This approach is generally regarded to be safest when a higher threshold is selected (as high as 5x is available). This process is an automated repayment method.

Another product is the liquidity locker. All created tokens are automatically opted into this feature with a minimum of 30 days, which begins when the loan is repaid in full. Tokens created outside the platform can also use this feature given they make a small payment in APE tokens. The lock period ranges from 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

Finally, Ape Express will be equipped with a mass sender contract and UI. This is for any creator wanting to do an airdrop or presale distribution manually.

Ape Express’ GTM strategy will include a referral/discount coupon program, initially to be issued by team members. In addition, APE stakers (10k tokens staked and up) will be able to generate their own referral and discount codes customizable up to 20% referral/discount mix.

An incentive program will also be put into action if approved for a grant. The tokens with the most activity, measured by volume and holders, will be awarded APE tokens every week for the token’s creator/treasury. These metrics are reset every week to further incentivize only currently active projects or new projects to receive such rewards.

Although we cant stop people from creating NSFW tickers on a permissionless blockchain we will have measures on our backend to hide any racist, hateful or pornographic material from our leaderboards. We can control what is represented on our platform and we will carefully monitor this to make sure we are in line with Apecoin guidelines

Paragraph Summary

Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets.

All art assets and Axie genetic data can be easily accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their own tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe.

While still in early access, Axie is ranked the #1 Ethereum game by daily, weekly, and monthly active users. It has generated over 13,000 ETH in revenue (16M+ USD) so far.

Motivation

Add $AXS as a lending currency into Aave money markets.

@Sutton (tw: ssSuttonSss) is an Axie Infinity guild manager and player at @AXGaming_sec .

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
**Axie Infinity Shards(AXS) are an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie Universe. **

Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
By listing $AXS you will be able to leverage an entire nation of gamers.

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
**
** Version 1 First half 2021 / Staking dashboard released
AXS holders can stake their tokens through the staking dashboard and participate in governance votes brought forward by the Sky Mavis team.

These votes will revolve around which teams should receive funding from the ecosystem fund, and how the Community treasury should be distributed.

Version 2 - Early 2022

More on-chain votes about smaller issues.

Potentially changing the way votes are being counted from 1 token 1 vote to Quadratic voting.

Version 3 - September 2023 / Decentralized Organization

AXS holders determine which governance framework should be used and how much should be voted on. Some decisions will not be up for debate such as token supply which is iron-clad in smart contracts.

Potential things that can be voted on:

Should Axie Infinity Limited continue to pay Sky Mavis to develop Axie Infinity?

Should Axie Infinity use the marketplace created by Sky Mavis?

How should the Community Treasury be used to reward AXS holders and the broader Axie community?

Should the Community Treasury funds be attached to any yield farming/staking services such as Yearn.finance or Rari.Capital?

How is the asset currently used?
*. In early 2021, the Community Treasury went live. The Community Treasury began to receive revenues generated by Axie Infinity as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury is by AXS stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. A more detailed overview of the Treasury can be found here 3.

The token has been designed in collaboration with Delphi Digital.
6. Emission schedule
AXS will be unlocked in a pre-determined schedule which lasts for 65 months from the public sale. The initial circulating supply is set to 59,985,000 AXS - 22.22% of the total supply.

259,"This proposal is a continuation of the topic from VIP-51. Previously, several VRT Swap & XVS Vesting architecture designs were proposed that differed from the original design summarized in the Venus Tokenomics 2 published in August of 2021. One of these alternative designs, referred to as “fixed speed vesting” proposed a vesting schedule that would have allowed all XVS to vest very quickly if VRT was separated into a multitude of accounts and deposited separately. This potential workaround required a countermeasure in the form of a global daily limit on all deposits. Many in the community pointed out concerns regarding this daily limit from a technical and user experience perspective.

We considered feedback regarding the daily limit and how this unfairly allows those with bots to consume the daily quota before everyone else each day. There is no technically feasible way to prevent this issue with the fixed speed model, so we are proposing deployment of the original swap & vesting design.

Check out the full details of the proposal here: https://community.venus.io/t/vip-52-vrt-swap-xvs-vesting/2378

The Vote will consist of these three different options:

FOR: Going with the proposed approach (Original Tokenomics Proposal)
AGAINST: Looking for other options.

260,"title: Aave V3 Harmony - Freeze Reserves
status: Proposal
author: 3SE Holdings

Simple Summary
This ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmony’s Horizon Bridge.

This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts.

Motivation
The Aave DAO Community, through the governance forum, has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users, Protocol, and DAO. (Harmony Horizon bridge exploit. Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1

This proposed action is a first step that will protect users.It will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue, by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop.

Specification
If passed, this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze() function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony. In addition, passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change (disabling supply and borrow) as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony.",bullish

263,"# Summary
1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.

# Motivations
Launched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):

Total trading volume: $160B
Total swaps: 5.91M
Total users: 1.25M

1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.

The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.

In December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.

# Benefits to Aave Community

1INCH is highly liquid.
1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.
1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.
1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.

# Specification
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
RoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3

3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.

1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.

1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.

On the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

The 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.

1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.

1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.

P2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.
1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.

Supported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.

# How is the asset currently used?

1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3

#Emission schedule

The 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.

Of the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).

Uncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).

# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability

The smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.

The 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.

## General

The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.

* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.
* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.
* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.
  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.
  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.
  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.

The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.

## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:

The 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M

The 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.

The 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.

On April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.

264,"#### ABSTRACT

At Karma, we have built a reputation system for DAO contributors participating in governance. We would like the ApeCoin community to adopt it for their needs. That would mean:

1. We can help setup a website which ApeCoin can host on their subdomain to display contributor stats (ex: https://optimism.showkarma.xyz). Some of the features are
2. Display high level voting summary
3. Display voting history from Snapshot/on-chain
4. Display delegate commitment message
5. Display delegate voting reason for each proposal
6. Delegate tokens right from the dashboard
7. Install discourse forum plugin that has the following features
8. Display governance stats of forum users (ex: see governance stats here “https://discuss.ens.domains/u/nick.eth/summary”
9. A custom form in the forum that delegates can use to post commitment message which gets posted in the forum and also displayed in the dashboard (bullet 1 above)
10. A custom form in the forum that delegates can use to post reasons for how they voted on each proposal which gets posted to form and also displayed in dashboard

#### OVERALL COST

$10,000 to cover dev cost for customizing dashboard, setup plugin and ongoing infrastructure and maintenance. We are also open to the option of doing all the work upfront and only if the community finds our product valuable, you can release the funds.

For reference, here’s the [current overview of our governance process.](https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/governance/governance-process)

In an effort to further decentralize, Balancer Labs is stepping away from the process and handing it over to the community. There’s three elements to the handoff:

1. Moving snapshot admin to a community representative

2. Ceding control of the snapshot ENS

3. Passing the burden of determining when soft consensus has been reached

I will present my suggestions for how the community moves forward on this. My goal is to start a dialogue so please do not hesitate to question anything and everything or offer up alternative ideas.

1. I have experience managing snapshot admin, so I humbly put myself forward as a volunteer to take the admin. I will remove the existing addresses capable of putting a proposal to snapshot and replace them with the addresses of the five full time Ballers - me, bakamoto, andrea, xeonus, and Mike B.

2. I suggest setting the governance multisig as controller of the ENS. The only function they will perform is changing the admin, which should not happen often if ever. This multisig contains many high profile and trusted names in the ethereum community and is the safest place to put the ENS in my opinion.

3. I propose creating a “gov council” of the five full time Ballers mentioned above. A majority vote in favor would be required before a proposal can be posted to snapshot. I can create a discord channel that is public read-only where the five of us will discuss if a proposal has reached soft consensus. It is extremely important to understand that it is not a question of if any of the five personally are in favor of a proposal, but that the community has reached a soft consensus to proceed. For example, if I personally oppose something but it is clear from forum discussion that most people are in favor, I would be obligated to vote in favor of the proposal going to snapshot.

Additionally, I suggest adding a requirement that each proposal include a forum poll as another signaling device we can use. It is gameable of course, but still a valuable input to have I think.

For a snapshot proposal to be considered valid & binding, it must be open for voting for at least three full days and announcements of the vote must be posted to the official @BalancerLabs Twitter account AND in the #announcements channel of Balancer’s discord. These announcements must be made with no less than 24 hours remaining in the vote.",neutral

269,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Stader ($SD) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Stader, a multi-chain liquid staking solution provider! 

Stader Labs offers a convenient way for users to stake their assets. It offers liquid staking solutions across multiple chains - BNB Chain, Polygon, Hedera, NEAR, Fantom, etc.

With Stader’s BNB liquid staking solution, users can stake BNB and earn yields with capital efficiency. Users can also amplify their yields by deploying BNBx (liquid token for staked BNB) in DeFi. 

The other token that powers the Stader ecosystem is SD, the native governance and value accrual token. Users can stake SD for rewards and governance rights.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn SD tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 26,500 SD
 - **Distribution duration:** 90 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 6 Mar 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 4 Jun 2023	
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.01022 SD

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

**100 $CAKE for the entire duration of the Syrup Pool.**

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the SD Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a BNBx-BNB Farm.  

The Farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for 90 days. At the end of the 90-day period – approx. 1200 UTC on 4 Jun 2023 – the Farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $SD?

Stader (SD) token is the multi-utility native governance token for Stader across networks. The core utilities include:

* Governance - When users stake SD tokens, they will receive xSD which is an auto-compounding token. xSD will have governance rights.
* Rewards and discounts - Liquidity providers for SD and xSD pairs with stables/native tokens will receive SD token rewards and pool fees.
* Leverage Stader infrastructure - Third-party protocols can stake xSD tokens to leverage Stader contracts/infrastructure.
* Preferential delegations and Insurance - Validators can stake xSD tokens to receive preferential delegations and provide slashing insurance to their delegators.

#### What is $BNBx?

BNBx is a reward-bearing liquid token. The value of 1 BNBx token vs. BNB increases over time as staking rewards accumulate.

#### To learn more, visit the project’s official channels:

270,"Introduction

This snapshot temp check asks the AaveDAO to approve a bug bounty program hosted on Immunefi. Immunefi proposes to engage with community contributors, the Aave Companies and BGD Labs, who would support the bug bounty program as technical experts in terms of receiving and evaluating bug reports as well as providing their view on what should and shouldn’t be covered under the program, pending DAO approval.


Motivation

Currently, the Aave Protocol boasts a TVL of over USD 5 billion. A key reason why the protocol has managed to amass such impressive liquidity is due to the DAOs security-focused culture. Users of the protocol feel safe when using Aave.

As the Protocol continues to develop thanks to impressive work done by DAO contributors, with some notable innovations being V3 and GHO, it continues to be incredibly important that as much care is taken to ensure that users feel safe when using the protocol.

One great way to further protect user funds is to enact an effective and standardized bug bounty program. A bug bounty program encourages security researchers to continuously look through our codebase and responsibly disclose any bugs that they find, especially as new types of vulnerabilities are being discovered. Additionally, it provides a last option for blackhat hackers who find a bug to disclose it instead of exploiting it and get rewarded with clean funds.


About Immunefi

Immunefi is the leading bug bounty and security services platform for Web3, featuring the world’s largest Web3 security community and bug bounty programs. Immunefi guards many billions in users’ funds across projects like Wormhole, MakerDAO, Polygon, Chainlink, Lido, Stacks, Optimism, and many more. The company has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities that put tens of billions of dollars at risk across hundreds of projects.


Implementation

Immunefi proposes to work together with two other community contributors, Aave Companies and BGD Labs, in order to ensure that the bug bounty program is written and maintained to an optimal level, ranging from the assets that are covered by the program, SLAs with regards to response times, rewards for valid bug reports, as well as points of clarification within the program. The terms of implementation in this section is thus not set in stone but will be the starting point for the program.

The assets considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program will be those that are identified as critical to the operation of the Protocol. However, in order to ensure maximum safety for Aave users, a bug report would be considered as in-scope regardless of the asset being listed or not as long as it is a Critical-level smart contract report with funds being directly at risk.

All rewards for bug reports will utilize the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System. If Immunefi develops a new classification system, the one implemented into the Aave bug bounty program may be changed to reflect these changes, and would request a review from both Aave Companies and BGD Labs. 

For the Aave bug bounty program, we will begin with covering Low to Critical vulnerabilities for smart contract assets. Additional severity levels will be considered shortly after its launch.

The reward amounts will be as follows:

Smart Contracts
Critical - Up to USD 1 000 000
High - Up to USD 100 000
Medium - Up to USD 5 000
Low -Up to USD 1 000

Final amounts will be decided after the scoping stage. 

Critical smart contract vulnerabilities will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 300 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. For avoidance of doubt, if a second attack would happen at 600 blocks and then a third at 900 blocks, the funds at risk would be counted at 50% and 25% from the first attack, respectively.
However, there will be a minimum reward such that the reward amount is above that of High in order to prevent hackers from sitting on a bug report while potential economic damage increases.

Rewards over USD 150 000 will be paid out in batches of up to USD 150 000 until the full reward amount is paid out. The first batch will be paid out within the SLA period for resolving a bug report and the monthly payout starts in the succeeding calendar month if the first Monday falls 15 days after the first payout.
High smart contract vulnerabilities will be further capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles for every additional 5 blocks that the funds could be temporarily frozen, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5, up to a maximum hard cap of the maximum High reward. This is implemented in order to account for the increased relative impact based on the duration of the freezing of funds. There will be, however, a minimum reward for High smart contract vulnerabilities.

In addition to the standard bug report information requested by Immunefi in its bug submission page, a runnable proof of concept (PoC) will be required for all smart contract bug reports. Exceptions may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident from simply mentioning the vulnerability and where it exists.

All bug report submitters must comply with the Immunefi rules. Employees and team members of the community contributor teams (including Aave Companies and BGD Labs in case the DAO supports that they are nominated to assist Immunefi), including those who held this status within 12 calendar months of a bug report date, are not eligible for any reward.

Payments will be made in stablecoins that are held in the treasury as well as AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve.


Immunefi Fee

As its standard fee, Immunefi will charge the DAO a performance fee based on the reward paid out to the bug bounty hunter, charged on top of the reward. This standard fee is 10%. Effectively this means that if a bug bounty hunter receives a reward of USD 1 000, Immunefi would be paid an additional fee of USD 100.
Immunefi will charge no onboarding or maintenance fees for hosting and assisting with the bug bounty program. Any add-on services will be dealt separately, if ever additional services are desired in the future.


Engagement with the DAO

As part of the above-mentioned program, it is required that there are entities directly in contact with Immunefi who can work on behalf of the DAO to review submissions and engage with security researchers along with other tasks. 
Naturally, as part of the bug bounty program extremely sensitive information could be shared.

If this program and our engagement with it is approved by the DAO, the responsibility of both companies will be the following:

-Engage with Immunefi in defining and launching the bug bounty program.

-Review all bug bounty submissions and assign a level of severity.

-Respond and engage with the security researcher to resolve and patch any vulnerabilities, though it is understood that the security researcher’s responsibility ends at providing information about the bug and not providing work for fixing.

-Any other stated responsibility as set out by the Immunefi statement of work.

-Update the DAO on important information regarding the program.

BGD Labs and Aave Companies in their capacity in supporting Immunefi would also seek to comply with the necessary SLAs wherever it is not restricted by governance systems within the Protocol, such as payments. This would be to ensure that security researchers can expect the same level of responsiveness that they do with other bug bounty programs on Immunefi.


Conclusion

This snapshot temp check proposes an Immunefi bug bounty program for the AaveDAO. The intention of this program is to properly incentivise white hats to test the security of the protocol and report recognised vulnerabilities. If approved, Aave Companies and BGD Labs would engage with Immunefi on behalf of the DAO.",neutral

273,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust three (3) total risk parameters including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across two (2) Aave V2 assets. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). 

## Specification


The past two weeks saw slight decreases in volatility. However, there were also decreases in liquidity and trading volume. Our simulations show that increasing borrow parameters across a wide array of assets could introduce significantly more risk in the short term. The below recommendations drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining risk at safe levels.


| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| FEI Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |
| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |


See below volatility and exchange volume data from 02/10 to 02/24. These are useful metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. 

|Symbol| 02-24 Volatility| 02-10 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| DPI    | 0.767483446      | 0.952875317     | -0.185391871      | 4.8907976   |
| FEI    | 0.05450812       | 0.072266895     | -0.017758775      | -41.5184138 |




## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. 

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

**Summary:**

>This proposal aims to approve the creation of a new gauge on Ethereum Mainnet with a 2% cap for APW-ETH

**References/Useful links:**

> Link to:
    • Website: https://spectra.finance/
    • Documentation: https://docs.spectra.finance/ || https://dev.spectra.finance/
    • Github Page: https://github.com/perspectivefi

**Protocol Description:**

> Spectra is an EVM-centric protocol for interest rate derivatives with an easy-to-use flagship app. The Spectra protocol is permissionless, meaning its services are entirely open for public use. Spectra’s Yield Token and Principal Token, minted on top of ERC-4626 interest-bearing tokens, are core protocol primitives. Spectra separates the right to principal from future yield via a process called yield tokenization. This process unlocks new financial possibilities beyond standalone interest-bearing tokens. Anyone can create new markets at will, swap yield derivatives, or become a liquidity provider. Spectra's native token, [APW](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/spectra-2), powers it's flywheel tokenomics. Holders can lock APW into veAPW and use it to vote on LM, receive bribes and vote on governance proposals.

**Motivation:**

> Spectra only has one primary source of liquidity and that is Balancer's APW <> ETH pool. We plan to deepen this relationship with tokenisation of Balancer Pool Tokens and veBAL liquid wrappers.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Spectra is a decentralized, community-governed protocol by the APW token holders. They can discuss, propose and vote on upgrades. Any APW holder can lock their tokens to convert into veAPW. More info on Spectra's governance can be found [here](https://app.spectra.finance/governance).

2. **Oracles:** Spectra does rely on price oracles to determine price data

3. **Audits:** [Audit Info](https://docs.spectra.finance/security/audits)

4. **Centralization vectors:** None

5. **Market History:** The APW/ETH pool was created approx. 7 days ago (29th of June, 2024). APW has been on the market since 18 May 2021, in that time it has not experienced sever volatility. Link to [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/spectra-2), [Pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x093254005743b7af89e24f645730ba2dd8441333) and [Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2fa29bbfd19314b3faf170dc7826ef69372203a6).
 
6. **Value:** This is expected to be the primary pool for this token. APW liquidity mining started a couple weeks ago so users are expected to be either trading out of APW, locking it for governance or trading it into the liquid version of veAPW.

**Technical Specification:**

The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:

280,"## Proposal Discussion Topic

[Blockchain at Berkeley](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu) is creating this proposal in partnership with [Nomad](https://www.docs.nomad.xyz/) to Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam.

## Summary

In support of furthering the vision of [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.

Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.

Moonbeam is a reputable chain which has enjoyed high stability and considerable activity since its launch in January, making it a great fit for Uniswap’s trusted brand.

## About Moonbeam

Moonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by [Polkadot’s XCM](https://polkadot.network/blog/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format/), allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way.

Moonbeam was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the [100+ projects](https://moonbeam.network/community/projects/) building DApps and protocols on the network.

## Expanding Uniswap to Moonbeam

We believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. 

Uniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s. However, Uniswap has not yet expanded beyond the greater Ethereum ecosystem.

Unlike the other deployment targets, Moonbeam represents a much larger target market — Polkadot users. The growth potential of the Polkadot ecosystem is reflected in part by the fact that Polkadot consistently ranks in the top ecosystems for developer activity, despite having just enabled parachains auctions in December 2021. The Polkadot community has grown in parallel with the Ethereum community, and shares many of the same values — decentralization, censorship resistance, open access to finance, to name a few. However, the two communities have largely been discrete, and deploying Uniswap on Moonbeam brings them together in a meaningful way.

Moonbeam is the de facto DeFi hub for Polkadot. Blue chip DeFi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to Moonbeam, including Sushiswap, Lido, Curve, Chainlink and Covalent. As the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying Uniswap V3 will position it to become a premier AMM on Moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. This represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for LPs and UNI token holders.

The Nomad team has worked on this proposal because [Nomad and Connext](https://medium.com/connext/connext-has-partnered-with-nomad-e20cd8e62e31) have already been deployed as Moonbeam’s main bridging solutions, and have begun to drive cross-chain liquidity from Ethereum into Moonbeam. By deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, Nomad would be able to route even more liquidity into Uniswap pools and additionally facilitate cross-chain communication for Uniswap governance.

## Trust-Minimized Bridging and Cross-Chain Governance

Decentralized cross-chain governance is a topic we are excited about working on within the Uniswap ecosystem. As Uniswap Labs highlighted in their post about [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of Uniswap. The Moonbeam community already uses [Nomad](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) and [Connext](https://www.connext.network/) to bridge ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum; despite Moonbeam having only been live for two months, $35M TVL is currently bridged to Moonbeam via Nomad, with over $250M in total volume since deployment. However, Nomad is more than just a protocol for token bridging; at its core, Nomad is a protocol for trust-minimized arbitrary message passing, and Uniswap V3 deployed on Moonbeam can leverage Nomad for governance.

We have worked with developers at Uniswap Labs to research, understand, and document the current state of [cross-chain governance for Uniswap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQWXCXdA5to7RKfVPozI8vEcw_QJrRQMP9HiQ8nbOu0/edit#heading=h.708hyjg41wlu) deployments. It became clear that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. This problem will multiply as Uniswap is deployed to more chains.

Nomad can provide an out-of-the-box solution for this problem. Nomad’s own contracts are governed by a decentralized cross-chain [governance app](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/blob/main/packages/contracts-core/contracts/governance/GovernanceRouter.sol) built on its arbitrary message passing rails. This application can be [tailored](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/pull/95) for the purpose of governing Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum mainnet. Rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once, however, we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de-risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment, Moonbeam.


## Rewards and Grants

As part of this proposal, Nomad, via a grant from the Moonbeam Foundation, will commit $2,500,000 to the Uniswap Grants Program to help grow the Multichain Uniswap ecosystem.

Through collaborative discussions with members of the Uniswap community, we learned that there were likely higher-leverage ways to enrich the Uniswap community than just providing liquidity mining rewards. As Uniswap develops into a multi-chain ecosystem, we want to support developers working to create high-quality multichain apps building on-top of Uniswap, and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users. These grants will promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation towards this goal.

To borrow language from the [Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/blog/case-study-uniswap-grants/#:~:text=Uniswap%20Grants%20gained%20access%20to,Gitcoin%20was%20founded%20in%202017) announcement, we hope for this initiative to fund “bounties, hackathons, and grants” for “developers, designers, community organizers and other web3 builders” working on multi-chain projects which improve, extend, promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross-chain manner.


Examples of projects that could be funded with this grant include: 
- Building a cross-chain application which allows Uniswap LPs to close a position on Ethereum and open one atomically on Moonbeam
- Improving open-source wallet softwares to create better multi-chain user experiences for Uniswap users
- Building a frontend application which allows governance participants to more easily construct cross-chain governance proposals for Uniswap
- Leveraging Substrate’s native interoperability protocol, XCM, to build an application which composes Uniswap on Moonbeam with another substrate chain
Funding office hours to educate new users about multichain crypto experiences

We are so excited to see what members of the Uniswap community come up with to leverage this grant!

## Conclusion

We are excited about the possibility of the Uniswap community entering the Polkadot ecosystem via a V3 deployment on Moonbeam. To reiterate, we feel that this is a fantastic opportunity for the following reasons:

- **Expansion into Polkadot**: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam’s EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeam’s position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot. 
- **Trust-minimized Governance**: Per Uniswap’s goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomad’s trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future.
- **Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program**: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap. We will commit $2.5M to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the Uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand Uniswap’s multi-chain presence.

We are excited to engage with the Uniswap community and governance process to discuss more around bringing Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. Please let us know any and all feedback and criticism, so that we can improve this proposal and expand Uniswap into Moonbeam and Polkadot!",neutral

These replacements have been completed on Ethereum and remain ongoing on Polygon, Arbitrum, and Fantom. You can see the most up to date list of signers [here](https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/governance/multisig). In order to ensure the activities of the DAO Multisig can continue uninterrupted we should replenish our list of available replacements. Thus, I propose adding the following people to the approved list of replacements:

* Lewis, Stablecoin Labs / Gyroscope (0xbcf751dBfe314Ee96A660EFA2Fcb259CBc364c29)
* Mounir, Paraswap (0x0951ff0835302929d6c0162b3d2495a85e38ec3a)

284,"#### Proposal to Launch veCAKE Gauges System

![](https://i.imgur.com/8kO0mY8.jpg)

#### Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

Over the next few days, the Kitchen is proposing to introduce **veCAKE**. This update is designed to empower CAKE holders with increased governance influence, boost liquidity across our pools, and supercharge rewards for CAKE stakers.

As announced in our [**Q4 Roadmap**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/readme/roadmap), PancakeSwap will be shortly launching vote-escrowed CAKE (veCAKE) and voting gauges. Voting gauges allow for veCAKE holders to vote on where future CAKE farm emissions will be directed.

Launching voting gauges will allow existing CAKE holders, stakers and protocols to begin accumulating veCAKE.

**At a high level, veCAKE holders will be able to:**

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders will be able to directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE managers and bribe markets, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE rewards and receive voting incentives for doing so. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to automate their voting and potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
Voting gauges are planned to be launched in phases, beginning with all liquidity pools on BNB Chain, Ethereum and Arbitrum.  Voting gauges on other chains will be added in progressive steps as we roll out all features related to the gauges.

The initial phase of veCAKE will include gauges for all farms that are currently receiving CAKE emissions across these three deployments. This means that every liquidity pool that currently has emissions is eligible to receive veCAKE votes.

#### The Kitchen’s Participation in veCAKE

Initially, the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum will be **~0.99 CAKE/block**.  This allocation will be taken from the existing CAKE Syrup Pool (~0.35 CAKE/block) and the Farm Emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum (~0.64 CAKE/block).

As part of the voting gauges design, the Kitchen proposes to retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to these farms. 

There are two key reasons:
- To ensure a smooth transition for liquidity providers from farms managed by the Kitchen to farms which are managed by veCAKE voting, without affecting their APRs significantly in the initial rollout
- To ensure that core liquidity pools continue to receive sufficient incentives, so that liquidity depth and fee generation are not significantly affected. This will ensure the continuity of CAKE burns from trading fees, which drives deflationary CAKE tokenomics.

*Note: “core liquidity pools” include major LPs like BNB, ETH, BTC, stablecoins, and CAKE.*

In the initial rollout phase, the Kitchen will distribute these votes based on the following principles:
- Ensuring core liquidity pools are provided a competitive return on their LP positions
- Ensuring that existing Syrup Pool partner arrangements are met before migrating them fully to the veCAKE gauge voting system
- Ensuring that any of the smaller farms which did not receive any votes after the launch of veCAKE will receive at least some allocation in the initial rollout, capped at their current emission levels.

With the proposed vote allocation, the Kitchen will distribute its share of votes at the end of each voting epoch after all voting participants have voted. 

In other words, the Kitchen will apply its voting share (at maximum, translating to ~0.4 CAKE/block) as far as needed to smoothen out any possible abrupt changes in the Farms, while allowing veCAKE participants to get used to the gauge voting mechanism. 

If the gauge voting results will not affect any core liquidity pools and trading volumes significantly, the Kitchen will abstain from voting in that particular voting epoch or vote in alignment with existing votes.

Over time, the Kitchen aims to reduce the portion of CAKE emissions directly managed by the Kitchen as all veCAKE participants become familiar with the process.

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE launched shortly after this vote concludes. Additionally, the Kitchen will provide CAKE holders a comprehensive FAQ on participating in veCAKE and the voting gauges.",bearish

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Add to rETH Holding
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & @DefiJesus + ACI - @MarcZeller 
created: 2023-10-14

---

# Summary

This publication proposes acquiring rETH with ETH held in the DAO's Ethereum Treasury.

# Abstract

This publication proposes converting a portion of the wETH, awETH and wEthWETH held in the Treasury to rETH.

A balance of 100 aEthWETH will remain in the Treasury to facilitate on going DAO expenses such as the [Quarterly Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680) and any other future expense that arise.

# Motivation

At the time of writing the Aave DAO has the following assets in the Ethereum Treasury:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 14.56 |22,543.32|
|awETH|530.39|820,829.60|
|aEthWETH|510.45 | 789,962.05|

The following assets are available to be claimed from the Paraswap Legacy Fees and Fee Claimer contract:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 4.53 |7,011.99|
|wETH| 10.8 |16,717.32|

This publication proposes converting all wETH, awETH and all but 100 aEthWETH to rETH. The 100 aEthWETH is to remain to support on going DAO funding. 

The table below shows the yield differential between the various assets:

|Asset|Yield (%)| 
| --- | --- | 
|wETH| 0.00|
|awETH|1.26|
|aEthWETH|1.97 |
|rETH|3.07|

Based upon current market conditions, the additional yield generated by converting the assets as outlined to rETH is $23,266.50. 

Upon implementation of this [ARFC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-aave-v3-eth-pool-weth-parameters/15110), the additional yield generated is ~$654.42, for the conservative and ~$2,782.86, for the aggressive approach due to the reduction in deposit rates of approximately 10.3 bps and 33.5bps respectively. This does not take into consideration how the market will then adjust after the ETH v3 interst rate parameters are changed. 

# Specification

The following is to be performed:

* Deposit all wETH into aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH)
* Withdraw all awETH (Aave V2 wETH) into ETH
* Withdraw all but 100 aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH) into ETH
* Deposit ETH into RocketPool's rETH
* Transfer rETH into collector

288,"title: [ARFC] increase caps for MAI Aave Polygon V3

Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative

Dated: 2023-02-02

Summary
MAI is a decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin minted by the QiDAO protocol

MAI is minted by qiDAO protocol users by locking collateral in vaults.

For more information about MAI please refer to MAI V3 ARC 2

This ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to increase MAI borrow cap on the Aave V3 polygon market.

Abstract
This ARFC proposes to increase the MAI borrow cap to 1M MAI to reflect market demand for this asset.

Motivation
Due to market demand for MAI liquidity, MAI utilization is close to borrow cap, and the current borrow cap is set at a level that has a probable effect on both MAI supplied (total cap making it impossible to reach uOptimal at the current level of liquidity) and drives out potential demand.

Allowing an increase of this borrow cap will allow supply and demand to find another equilibrium for the benefit of liquidity providers, borrowers & protocol revenue with expected increased borrow demand.

The new proposed cap is set at a level that allows the market to find this new equilibrium while maintaining a conservative approach.

Title: [ARFC] Updating weETH Risk Parameters 
Date: 2024-04-18
Author: MarcZeller - ACI
---

## Summary:

This proposal aims to update the risk parameters and interest rate strategy of the weETH asset on the Ethereum pool to boost Aave DAO revenue and encourage collateral adoption.

## Motivation

The successful onboarding of EtherFI into Aave has demonstrated significant demand for weETH usage as both collateral and a borrowing asset, with both initial supply caps reached in minutes and second cap increases filled under similar conditions. To accommodate this demand and facilitate protocol growth, this proposal suggests increasing the supply cap of weETH on the Ethereum pool and the borrow cap at 35% of the new supply cap amount. This proposal also aims at changing the interestRate Strategy to place the optimal ratio at 35% of liquidity.

Expanding borrow capacity will result in a higher collateral yield, which in turn creates a positive flywheel effect on supply and demand. By maintaining the borrow cap at an optimal ratio (35%) of the supply cap, we can balance risk, available liquidity, and LP yield effectively.

We also propose to increase weETH RF to 45% to contribute to Aave DAO revenue.

## Specification

This AIP aims to sponsor MOCA MONDAY Spaces and establish a rewarding vault for the community

With MOCA MONDAY we want to implement a Cross-Community focused Spaces to educate people of the Mocaverse, BAYC and Apecoin Community about general processes in the DAO, votings and explanations of AIPs.

With the raise of Mocaverse, one of the first Communities to delegate an amount of over 1.5 Million Apecoin, we think it became crucial and important to Build a Cross-Community focused Spaces where these Communities come together to learn about each others Culture and especially educate and learn about the ApecoinDAO in his mindset, the processes of participation, votings and inform about the actual AIPs and their content.

1.1 - Key Highlights

* Educate the Communities about the ApecoinDAO processes

* Weekly discussions about the content of ALL AIPs which are up for Voting

* AIP Authors and Partners live on Stage

* Learn about participation in the ApecoinDAO

* Promote important Cross-Community News & informations

* Higher participation in the ApecoinDAO, the Ape Assembly and the Mocaverse DAO

* Increase the knowledge of all Holders about BAYC, Apecoin, Yugalabs and their Ecosystem.

1.2 - Allocation

Allocation: The funds will be divided into two essential areas:

1. Community Engagement: A portion of the funds will be used to purchase exciting prizes to boost community engagement. This will help us build strong connections between the growing MOCA DAO, Apecoin DAO, and the broader community.

2. Production Enhancement: The other part of the funds will be invested in elevating the production value of these spaces. This includes improvements in editing, distribution, delegation, and marketing.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

* Reach a higher Level in understanding the processes of the ApeCoin DAO for Mocaverse Holders

* Get more educated Voters as they will be educated over every AIP upfront

* Higher the knowledge of AIP Authors how to place their AIPs in the best way in the Mocaverse Ecosystem

* Having more interested people joining the Ape Assembly

* Receiving more engaged AIP Projects which benefits the Apecoin Ecosystem

* Increase Awareness of Apecoin, the DAO, Mocaverse and other potential 3rd Party Communities which become future delegates

* Implementing a Showcase and Reference how different Communities can be integrated in a best possible way into the Story of Apecoin and BAYC to higher participation and growth

* By rewarding participation with BAYC/Mocaverse NFTs as also a crucial amount of Apecoin being rewarded to potentially and mostly new Users of the Apecoin Ecosystem

291,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Loan To Value, across four (4) Aave V2 assets. 



## Abstract

This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. 

## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

As shown in the below chart and dashboard screenshot, our simulations show that Aave can increase capital efficiency while also decreasing the risk of bad debt.

These liquidation threshold increases, assuming unit elasticity, result in a projected increase of $8.22M in total borrows across assets. The following chart breaks down the top projected borrow increases by symbol:

## Risk Dashboard

The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

These parameter changes increase borrow usage by 18 basis points, decrease VaR by $1.71M and increase LaR by $2.39M.

title: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
created: 2024-02-29

---

# Summary

This publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee with 500k GHO to continue supporting GHO's liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next 3 months.

# Motivation

Since its initial [funding in October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/343/), the Aave Liquidity Committee (previously GLC) has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes by deploying and incentivising liquidity pools.
 
As a result of these efforts:

* Deeper on-chain liquidity
* Lower slippage, especially for GHO to USDC swaps

In combination with other efforts like stkGHO, ALC's initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHO's peg recovery.

Throughout the period, the ALC leveraged on both Uniswap v3 and, more frequently, Maverick to tailor liquidity distribution at specific price ranges which helped absorb GHO downward market volatility. A list of active Boosted Positions can be found [here](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions?chain=1).

While some pools are incentivised by voting with pre-existing DAO holdings (e.g. vlAURA), others like Maverick's concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses. It is worth noting, the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick. We expect Maverick, and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3, to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience.

Concentrated GHO liquidity was [recently introduced in Balancer](https://twitter.com/GyroStable/status/1757365157917815001) with the creation of several E-CLP pools. These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAO's vlAURA holding. When there is excess vlAURA votes, these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70% APR nominated in USDC. 

The following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHO's ecosystem, highlights:

* GHO/USDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume 
    * 0.2% bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period
    * 0.1% bin width pool is starting to replace the 0.2% bin width pool trading volume. This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 0.1% bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility 
*  GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP
    *  Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by [other protocols](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Graham_/status/1762076544241955070) and leveraged farming is introduced
* Gyrsocope E-CLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks
    *  As the peg improves, one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg

The next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas:

* 1.00:1.00 peg with USD 
* Reducing price volatility
* Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations
* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools
* Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases

These efforts will need to scale to match GHO's expected growth profile. The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins, and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future, as well as participation in the launch of various projects like [Ethena](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and [f(x) Protocol's launch](https://x.com/protocol_fx/status/1762822716854354015?s=20). 

Though there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates, price volatility, and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations, we believe a high-level budget will look like the following:

| Objective | Category | Budget   |
| --------  | --------  | -------- |
| Liquidity | Peg Resilience | 360k GHO |
| DeFi Integrations  | Create Utility  |  140k GHO |
|Total| | 500k GHO|

It is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum.

# Performance Indicators

The below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking:

| Description| Optimal Value|
| --------  | --------  |
| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M |
| TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools  | 15M excl. stkGHO  |
| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |
| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap | < 0.10%  (GHO to USDC)|
| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  |
| Price level for > 90% time   | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  |

Please note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next 3 months on the assumption the Borrow Cap is continually increased beyond the current 35M Bucket Size. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.

The [stkGHO implementation](https://app.aave.com/staking), [USDe integration](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and coordinated efforts to attract users to acquire GHO are all great examples of how growth initiatives drive GHO utility, adoption and have a positive impact the spot price. 

Each of the above metrics, plus more, will be shown on the TokenLogic analytics dashboard.

# Specification

Swap the following assets for GHO:

* 250k aUSDT
* 250k aUSDC

Create an allowance for 500k GHO.

ALC SAFE: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`

# Protocol Description:

## Jarvis Network

Jarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks.

The Synthereum protocol has four modules:

* Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed.
* Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types.
* Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio.
* Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools.

Most jFIATs have a fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Midas), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy).

### Transfero

Transfero Group is an international financial solutions company based on blockchain technology in the Crypto Valley, Switzerland. Its objective is to connect emerging countries to the global market through a platform of financial solutions based on blockchain infrastructure, providing greater efficiency, flexibility, and access for people and businesses.

Transfero also developed BRZ, a stablecoin backed 1:1 by Brazilian real (BRL), to give South Americans a reliable asset to the blockchain industry. The BRZ token is live on Algorand, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Stellar. BRZ was featured in a World Economic Forum panel in 2020.

BRZ is integrated with fiat on and off-ramp (BityPreco) and crypto-card solutions (Wirex) and can be borrowed and lent on money markets (Midas).

# Motivation:

The role of the 2brl pool is to increase the stability of BRZ (1), the on-chain liquidity of both BRZ and jBRL (2), and connect the Transfero and Jarvis ecosystems (3). Together, these 3 points allow for building a Brazilian DeFi ecosystem.

1. BRZ peg: since jBRL can be exchanged for USDC back and forth at the BRLUSD Chainlink price feed and without price impact, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and the Jarvis Liquidity Pool to help maintain the BRZ peg.

2. On-chain liquidity:

* BRZ: since jBRL can be exchanged for USDC without price impact, then exchanging jBRL or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap BRZ to jBRL and then to USDC to access the latter's liquidity or vice versa.
* jBRL: jBRL main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jBRL minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets); this is why we are launching this pool as well as other pools (jBRL-USDC and jBRL-ETH, but this will be for another proposal).

3. Connect ecosystems: the 2brl pool connects Transfero and its BRZ (essentially a fiat on and off-ramp for Brazilian DeFi users) to the jBRL's ecosystem, enabling multiple use cases.

  * **Credit without FX risk**: borrow jBRL, swap for BRZ, then redeem BRL.
  * **DeFi on-ramp**: use BRL to mint BRZ, then access yield or on-chain liquidity.
  * **Remittance**: connect BRZ fiat on and off-ramp to any other jFIAT or USDC fiat on and off-ramp (we already performed payments between Brazil and Mexico and Brazil and France on the BNB Chain).

### A few notes:

* Jarvis LTD has started building a position in BAL and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same position.
* Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools to bribe veBAL voters (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot).
* Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield.
* This proposal is the first of many, as Jarvis Network is moving all their liquidity pools from Curve (stable pools) and Uniswap/Sushiswap/Kyber (volatile pools) to Balancer.

# Specifications:
 
1. Governance:
  * Jarvis: no on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a ⅝ multi-sig (only one team member in the signers).
    * Polygon: 0x2709fa6FA31BD336455d4F96DdFC505b3ACA5A68
    * Ethereum: 0x2CA74be68f0A0e053F030D143C1376806BaBEdc9

    * Optimism: 0x40bd131fA9933D592344783E38f0c0F27767d9FA
  * Transfero: centralised entity.
2. Oracles: jBRL uses BRLUSD Chainlink price feed; BRZ token does not have a price feed
3. Audits:
  * Jarvis: https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MlHWTFf2MofxCAFbR4l/s/-MeLxeE9i1iOeDR_J-tQ/risks-warning/audits
  * Transfero:
4. Centralizing vector: jBRL is mainly collateralized by USDC; BRZ is a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a centralized entity.
5. Market history: jBRL has been live since February 2022 (on the BNB Chain); it has traded a bit off its peg during the FTX crisis due to a too-high supply of jBRL on a money market vs. a too-low number of jBRL minted through the Liquidity Pool (the number of jBRL that you can sell in the Liquidity Pool = the number of jBRL that people has bought; so people borrow a lot of jBRLs from the Credit Line or which have been minted through the Printer, and sell them all through the Liquidity Pool, it can prevent other jBRL holders from selling jBRLs through the pool, preventing any arbitrages from happening). We have solved the issue by withdrawing jBRL from the money market, forcing users to repay their loans by buying jBRL from the Liquidity Pool. At the same time, BRZ had an issue with its peg because its primary off-chain market was on FTX, and the pool used a wrapped BRZ from Solana. Besides last week's event, both stablecoins have maintained their peg since the pool launch (on the BNB). We have learned how to prevent these situations from happening again or fix them quickly. Two other rare cases can prevent users from buying jBRL from the Liquidity Pools (again leading to preventing arbitrages from happening), and we also know how to mitigate them (currently working on it as we speak).
6. Value:
  * The 2brl pool will act as the main route for arbitrages and the use cases mentioned above (on-chain liquidity, credit without FX risks, etc.).
  * It will be our first step toward moving our ecosystem to Balancer's.

### Background: 
Uniswap’s [genesis liquidity incentive program](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) ended on Nov 17. The program distributed 20 million UNI to LPs over 2 months, split evenly between the WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, and DAI/ETH pools. This worked out to 2.5 million UNI per pool, per month.

#### Benefits of UNI distribution to LPs:
Ongoing incentives allows UNI to be distributed to those providing value in the form of liquidity
The incentivized pools are likely to remain the most liquid DEX pair on Ethereum, providing a venue to trade against ETH at virtually any size with zero slippage.
Reduced incentives prevents UNI from being distributed ‘too fast’, marked by all tokens being distributed before the Foundation’s four year vesting has passed.

#### Drawbacks of UNI distribution to LPs:
Ongoing incentives result in UNI largely being ‘farmed and dumped’ to earn yield. See ETH USD Yield Farm, Pickle, Harvest and Alpha.
Reduced incentives means UNI is distributed slower.
Incentivizing the same pools can be seen as choosing ‘winners’ by selecting WBTC as THE Bitcoin on Ethereum and favoring certain stablecoins over others.

### Proposed new distribution: 
Distribute UNI for an additional 2 months from the time this proposal is adopted and executed by governance, but at half the rate of the previous distribution (5 million UNI per month instead of 10 million UNI per month). 

**Note that pool distributions were adjusted slightly from the previous [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-distribute-uni-to-liquidity-providers/8591) process**. Reasoning behind this adjustment can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590/68). 

UNI will be distributed to the following 4 pools:
WBTC/ETH - 1.67 million UNI per month, ⅓ of total
USDC/ETH - 1.25 million UNI per month, ¼ of total
USDT/ETH - 1.25 million UNI per month, ¼ of total
DAI/ETH - 0.83 million UNI per month, ⅙ of total

Please see the liquidity incentive [governance plan document](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590) for full details and timelines. 

### Consensus check question:

Should Uniswap distribute UNI to liquidity providers per the specifications outlined above?

### Next steps:
The previous [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-distribute-uni-to-liquidity-providers/8591) process passed with sufficient support of UNI voters. The following consensus check poll is the second phase of Uniswap’s [governance process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732).

The snapshot poll will be live for 5 days. If the poll passes with a minimum of 50,000 UNI in support, this initiative will move forward as a formal governance proposal.

#### Proposal to Launch veCAKE Gauges System on zkSync

As mentioned in our initial [**veCAKE proposal**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), we are launching veCAKE in phases, and are excited to share the next deployment - zkSync!

#### Recap: Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

As a quick summary, here’s quick recap of veCAKE, with the following utilities:

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders will be able to directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE managers and bribe markets, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE rewards and receive voting incentives for doing so. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to automate their voting and potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
#### Inclusion of zkSync in veCAKE Gauges System

Currently, the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum is **~0.99 CAKE/block**.  

With the inclusion of zkSync, the current **Trading Allocation** emission of 0.0131 CAKE per block directed towards zkSync Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions. 

As part of the voting gauges design, the Kitchen proposes to retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs, such as ETH-USDC on zkSync. 



There are two key reasons:
- To ensure a smooth transition for liquidity providers from farms managed by the Kitchen to farms which are managed by veCAKE voting, without affecting their APRs significantly in the initial rollout
- To ensure that core liquidity pools continue to receive sufficient incentives, so that liquidity depth and fee generation are not significantly affected. This will ensure the continuity of CAKE burns from trading fees, which drives deflationary CAKE tokenomics.

In the initial rollout phase, the Kitchen will distribute these votes based on the following principles:
- Ensuring core liquidity pools are provided a competitive return on their LP positions
- Ensuring that existing Syrup Pool partner arrangements are met before migrating them fully to the veCAKE gauge voting system
- Ensuring that any of the smaller farms which did not receive any votes after the launch of veCAKE will receive at least some allocation in the initial rollout, capped at their current emission levels.

With the proposed vote allocation, the Kitchen will distribute its share of votes at the end of each voting epoch after all voting participants have voted. 

In other words, the Kitchen will apply its voting share (at maximum, translating to ~0.4 CAKE/block) as far as needed to smoothen out any possible abrupt changes in the Farms, while allowing veCAKE participants to get used to the gauge voting mechanism. 

If the gauge voting results will not affect any core liquidity pools and trading volumes significantly, the Kitchen will abstain from voting in that particular voting epoch or vote in alignment with existing votes.

Over time, the Kitchen aims to reduce the portion of CAKE emissions directly managed by the Kitchen as all veCAKE participants become familiar with the process.

More information can be found in our [**docs**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/vecake/gauges-voting/faq). 

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE launched shortly on zkSync after this vote concludes.",bullish

## Summary

Introduce govFactor, an on-chain voting factor of 1.1 for Balancer Liquidity Providers.

If passed, the govFactor will initially be implemented as a 3 month trial with voter participation acting as the key success metric. 

## Background

🔥_ 🔥 ([FireEyesDAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao)) has been actively working with the Balancer team over the past few months in an effort to develop a robust suite of governance mechanisms to complement the upcoming launch of Balancer V2.

One of the issues we concluded on: consistent voter participation has historically been an issue for many DeFi protocols. Whether it results in proposals not reaching quorum or only having a small number of participants involved, it’s become obvious that protocols need to drive meaningful voter participation across a diverse group of users.

The govFactor creates a simple incentive mechanism for liquidity providers (LPs) to actively participate in governance. 

## Motivation

As it stands, Balancer liquidity mining encourages passive participation. Liquidity Providers (LPs) simply deposit capital into the protocol and earn BAL. Despite the significant subsidy LPs receive in the form of governance tokens, there’s no expectation or requirement that they actively participate in governance.

This ultimately represents a misalignment as LPs have no incentive to vote despite constantly accruing voting weight. If the suppliers are subsidized by the protocol with governance power, they should be willing stewards of the protocol as well.

This does not mean that LPs MUST participate, but instead **they should have an incentive to participate**. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to incentivize those that service the protocol to help govern it as well, aligning their participation with additional weighting to their weekly liquidity mining rewards. 

## Specification

The govFactor is an on-chain voting incentive for LPs that affects BAL liquidity mining allocations depending on whether or not an address voted on the last governance proposal. The implementation multiplies BAL amounts each LP gets by their govFactor (1.1 for those who voted, 1.0 for those who did not) and then normalizes all amounts so that the sum is still 145,000 BAL per week. 

The govFactor will operate as an “on/off” switch where LPs that voted on the most recent proposal by signing a transaction turn “on” the factor.

Providers that did not vote on the last proposal by signing a transaction have their govFactor “off”, forfeiting the factor and in turn, receive lower LP rewards than those that voted on the last proposal. This dynamic will remain “off” until the next on-chain proposal is open for voting and ratified on-chain.

If all LPs vote, then the rewards remain the same as if no one votes.

 **To make calculations as simple as possible, govFactor would be applied after all other factors.**

GovFactor looks at addresses who have voted on the most recent proposal featured on Snapshot and references to see if the address is also providing liquidity to the protocol. If both variables are met, the protocol includes a factor to their weekly BAL liquidity mining allocation.

It’s important to note that this reference happens entirely on-chain, meaning there’s no need to cross-link any addresses to a forum or public username.

Ultimately, the **govFactor creates a unified incentive for those that service the protocol to become active governance participants as well** and should be considered by the community as a simple mechanism for encouraging governance participation from the protocol's supply-side actors.  

## Drawbacks

Some points to consider surrounding the GovFactor:

* The end result could be a lot of non-engaged voting, coming from LPs who don't hold meaningful amounts of BAL (even if being large LPs) and who don't really care about Balancer governance, putting little to no effort in the decision process behind their votes.
* The GovFactor encourages LPs to vote through their liquidity mining address, which could pose some issues for opsec conscious users. However, Snapshot now enables delegation from cold wallets which would mitigate this issue. 
* The cadence between different governance proposals is likely to differ. This means that someone who votes on the last proposal preceding a large time gap to the next proposal may see increased liquidity rewards despite not actively participating in governance discussions.
* The state of Balancer Governance is relatively idle and therefore implementing a governance incentive isn’t currently necessary for the success of the protocol.",bullish

#### Recap: Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

Here’s a quick recap of veCAKE’s utility:

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders can directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE Managers, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE emissions. Users who staked CAKE in the old Cake Pool can opt to delegate their CAKE to potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
#### Inclusion of opBNB in the veCAKE Gauges System

With the inclusion of opBNB, the current **Trading Allocation** emission of ~100 CAKE/day directed towards opBNB Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions. 

As voted for previously, the Kitchen will retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs, such as USDT-BNB on opBNB. This is to maintain the liquidity depth and volumes of these core pairs, which contribute significantly to CAKE buyback-and-burn.

316,"We propose the cross-chain deployment of Venus Protocol to X-Layer by OKX. X Layer is a ZK-powered layer-2 network that connects the OKX and Ethereum communities, enabling users worldwide to participate in a global on-chain ecosystem. The ecosystem has seen successful cross-chain deployment of projects such as: Frax Finance, Zerolend, QuickSwap, etc. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome Venus to its ecosystem.

Summary

Why launch on X Layer

Boundless scalability: enable ZK-powered DApps on X Layer, with 100% EVM compatibility and easy-to-use developer tools for deployment.

Powered by OKX: seamless OKX product integrations, all-in-one Web3 gateway, and access to 50M+ users in the OKX ecosystem.

Security: rely on robust secure mechanisms from Ethereum, with trustless interoperability.

Low fee: same coding experience as Ethereum, with 100x less in costs.

Portal to Web3: enter the world of Web3 via OKX Wallet, built with compact infrastructure modules to create innovative DApps.

High performance: Powered by one of the fastest ZK proof algorithms and the most advanced hardware cluster in the world, X Layer ensures transactions are confirmed swiftly, sparing users the long wait times commonly associated with other networks.

Motivations

The X Layer ecosystem is in need of a reliable and reputable lending market such as Venus to serve as the primary lending hub. Venus would also get first mover advantage and access to a large amounts of $OKB, WETH, WBTC, Stablecoins, LRTs/LSTs onboarded to X Layer from OKX’s CEX to cement its place as the defacto lending/borrowing destination.

Benefits

- Support from OKX Wallet: OKX Wallet has more than 1 million daily addresses. Thorough seamless collaboration with the OKX Wallet team, X Layer and Venus will enjoy the user inflows from OKX Wallet.

- Support from the OKX Earn Team: OKX Web3 Earn will integrate Venus into its DeFi Earn programme which would help tap into bluechip liquidity from OKX’s centralised exchange.

- First mover advantage: Get first mover advantage and access to a large amount of users and capital onboarded to X Layer from the OKX ecosystem. A first mover advantage along with the established brand name of Venus would enable Venus to become the defacto lending platform for users on X Layer.

- Partnership support: The X Layer BD team will assist Venus with intros to teams such as native stablecoins, LRTs and also popular long tail assets which could potentially be used as collateral on Venus. Co-marketing and technical support will also be provided to ensure that Venus has a smooth onboarding process.

- Asia Market Exposure: Venus will get a massive exposure to Asia Community as OKX and Polygon dominate the relevant market.

317,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes unshETH ($USH) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with unshETH! 

unshETH is a DeFi protocol that allows users to deposit their Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) to mint unshETH, an “index” of ETH LSDs.

The goal is to improve validator decentralization among the different Liquid Staking Protocols via incentives. When the deposit ratio of the different LSDs is closer to the “optimal ratio” set by governance, unshETH holders will collectively earn higher yields as a result.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn USH tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 320,000 USH
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1400 UTC on 25 Apr 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1400 UTC on 24 Jun 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.1851 USH

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the USH Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing an **unshETH-USDT (0.25% fee tier)** and an **unshETH-USH (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm on BNB Chain.


The **unshETH-USDT (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm will have 35x CAKE rewards for the first week, followed by 23x CAKE rewards for the remaining 53 days. The **unshETH-USH (0.25% fee tier)** v3 farm will have 12x CAKE rewards for the first week, followed by 8x CAKE rewards for the remaining 53 days. During and at the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1400 UTC on 24 Jun 2023 – the farms will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $unshETH?

unshETH is a diversified liquid staked ETH index that earns staking ETH yield and swap fees (not live yet), all wrapped in a single omnichain ERC-20 token available on ETH and BNB Chain.

Within the unshETH ecosystem, users can:

- Mint unshETH by depositing a supported ETH liquid staking derivative (e.g. wstETH, cbETH, rETH, sfrxETH)
- Redeem a mix of the underlying LSDs proportional to the current deposit ratio for each unshETH
- Earn ETH staking yield by simply holding unshETH

The team is also working on the following utilities, which are in development and are not live yet:

- Swap between LSDs up to their maximum weight as determined by the “optimal ratio” set by governance
- Earn swap fees by simply holding unshETH

For more information on how to interact with unshETH, visit **[here](https://docs.unsheth.xyz/)**

#### How do I get $unshETH on BNB Chain?

There are two ways to get unshETH on BNB Chain
- Deposit BNB or USDT on BNB Chain **[here](https://unsheth.xyz/deposit)** and receive unshETH. The protocol handles all the back-end work for users, read more **[here](https://mirror.xyz/0x749Dc728A68265e74754Ad8e6cc2649BD42a8f8a/t7vYrWdiqPycEhm956mqEDbPa8F6tNxeKCcxFP11_AQ)**
- Mint unshETH on Ethereum **[here](https://unsheth.xyz/deposit)** and bridge it over to BNB Chain **[here](https://unsheth.xyz/bridge)**

#### What is $USH?

USH is the governance and incentive token to accelerate the growth of unshETH’s TVL and liquidity, and to foster competition among liquid staking protocols through a convex-style ve-locked USH system. 

Staked USH (vdUSH) governs:
- Index composition of unshETH, such as the types of supported LSDs and their respective weights within the index
- Allocation of USH incentives and partner protocol incentives
- Fee curve parameters and fee switch

This is a vote to adopt CIP-1 as the foundational process for Compound Improvement Proposals. Per the adoption process for Meta CIPs, CIP-1 will go through a snapshot vote for 1 week with a simple majority and no quorum threshold. Details on CIP-1 can be found below or in the following [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eiy5IxLcnfGC3UHQ11cBroGJpxPVSWqMaMOq0j3dhJE/edit#heading=h.mvjq6jf0433)

# CIP-1: Purpose and Guidelines for Compound Improvement Proposals

Author: Michael Lewellen
Contributors: @allthecolors, @dakeshi, @adam_b_compound, @harsha, @boardroom, @kevin
Status: Final Call
Type: Meta Process
Created: 2022-10-20

## Overview

A Compound Improvement Proposal (CIP) describes standards, processes and enhancements intended to improve the Compound Protocol. They can take the form of governance processes, on-chain enhancements, off-chain tooling or other goals that help Compound achieve objectives as a leading DeFi lending platform.


## CIP Rationale

CIPs are intended to be the default mechanism to improve Compound as both on-chain code and off-chain processes.

It’s important to note that CIPs are strictly separate from [Compound Governor Proposals](https://compound.finance/governance) and should not be considered a required prerequisite for submitting an on-chain proposal. Instead, CIPs are intended to define better processes for certain types of Governance Proposals in addition to serving as a way to solicit community feedback and acceptance on certain protocol enhancements before they are submitted on-chain.

Overall, CIPs serve as a collection point for improvement suggestions for the protocol. Community participants can also use CIPs to find contribution opportunities and even seek funding through grant committees and other support groups.


## CIP Types

There are three types of CIP:



1. **Meta Process** - describes any process to be adopted or modified to coordinate Compound governance, development, or community efforts
2. **Protocol Enhancement** - describes any change to the smart contracts that make up the Compound Protocol and Governor
3. **Tooling & Support** - describes any additions or improvements to off-chain infrastructure, tooling, documentation or other components that support the usage of the Compound protocol.


## CIP Lifecycle

CIP Authors will start out with an idea, draft that idea into a CIP document, request a peer review and then move through an approval process with the Compound Working Group. Ideas can be filed as issues on a commonly shared GitHub similar to [Ethereum PM](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/). CIPs can be drafted as PRs and then request review to be added to the agenda for the biweekly Working Group meetings.
 
 
![image](ipfs://bafkreigc72pcgfa7sze5nadlbp3jrpb2r4f2dvhrmkhm6q4w6otruzaexi)
    
    
CIP Editors will be selected from among core community contributors that will attend meetings regularly and provide feedback to CIPs. If any objections are raised to a CIP in its first meeting, it must address that feedback and then request another review in a future meeting. In a CIP’s second meeting, if there are no objections OR a majority of Editors are in favor, the CIP is approved and then remains in Last Call for 14 days before the implementation process begins.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreig3mazojyhynck673fbqkkawegfjiqt7yjjityh53ojh456pucdbu)
    

Once past the Working Group, a CIP’s implementation path will diverge depending on its type. Meta Process CIPs will be approved by a majority Signal vote by COMP holders with no quorum after which they will become officially adopted as part of the Compound governance process that all COMP holders are expected to uphold. Other CIPs are left to the community to implement which can include funding to be approved by a Grant Committee or any other entity willing to support. Protocol Enhancements will also need to pass through a Compound Governance vote just as any other smart contract change would.


## What belongs in a successful CIP?

Each CIP should have the following parts:



* **Preamble** - RFC 822 style headers containing metadata about the CIP, including the CIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), a description (limited to a maximum of 140 characters), and the author details.
* **Abstract** - Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.
* **Motivation** - A motivation section should clearly explain why the existing protocol state is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. 
* **Proposal Details** - One or more sections that thoroughly explain the technical solution and/or processes of the proposal . The specification should be detailed enough to allow for either a technical implementation or adoption of a governance process should the CIP be approved.
* **Rationale** - The rationale describes what motivated the CIP and why particular design or process decisions were made. It should include alternate designs/processes that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature/process is implemented in other protocols. The rationale should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion around the CIP including technical and legal concerns.
* **Expected Impact** - The CIP’s expected impact should list measurable results for how Compound will be improved by its implementation. It might also take note of negative trade-offs mentioned in the Rationale section and demonstrate here that they are outweighed by the positive effects.
* **Security Considerations** _(optional)_ - While not always required for “Meta Process” or “Tooling & Support” CIPs, every “Protocol Enhancement” must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change.
* **Copyright Waiver** - All CIPs must be in the public domain. The copyright waiver MUST link to the license file and use the following wording: _Copyright and related rights waived via [CC0](/LICENSE)._


## CIP Formats and Templates

CIPs should be written in markdown format. There is a template to follow that will be established in a GitHub repository for tracking and approving all CIPs.


## CIP Editors

The current CIP editors are:

* Michael Lewellen (@cylon)
* Sriharsha Karamchati (@harsha)
* @Arr00
* Jared Flatow (@jared)
* Geoffery Hayes (@hayesgm)
* Kevin Cheng (@kevin)
* Duncan Dobbelmann (@Boardroom)
* @Dakeshi
* Michael Imperiale (@CL_Michael)

## CIP Editor Responsibilities

For each new CIP that comes in, an editor does the following:

* Read the CIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don’t seem likely to get to final status.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* Check the CIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (GitHub flavored Markdown), code style

If the CIP isn’t ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the CIP is ready for the repository, the CIP editor will:

* Assign a CIP number (generally the PR number, but the decision is with the editors)
* Merge the corresponding pull request
* Send a message back to the CIP author with the next step.
* The CIP editors monitor CIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

The editors don’t pass judgment on CIPs. They merely do the administrative & editorial part. Editors may still voice either support or opposition to the CIP’s claims of improving Compound but that should not factor into their decision-making criteria to approve a CIP. That will come down to the implementation phase where a CIP is left up to a Snapshot, Governance or Grant decision.

320,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

**Based on the last vote outcome, this proposal has been resubmitted after much consideration and data analysis to come up with the final list of farms to adjust farm rewards for. Please read the proposal carefully and consider the implications before casting your vote.**

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

**Summary:**
> Gains Network (gTrade) is a decentralized perpetual futures trading platform on Arbitrum. Gains Network aims to list gUSDC, a token that benefits from protocol fees, on Balancer to establish significant liquidity and integrations within the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem.

    • Other useful links: https://dune.com/gains/gtrade_stats 

**Protocol Description:**

>Gains Network [(gTrade)](https://gains.trade/trading#BTC-USD) is a decentralized perpetual futures trading platform with a robust infrastructure featuring 181 trading pairs with high leverage [up to 150x for crypto, 250x for commodities, and 1000x on forex], deep liquidity, guaranteed order execution, and accurate pricing. Since inception, the protocol has generated $73B lifetime volume.
The asset Gains Network would like to list on Balancer is gUSDC. gUSDC is one of the gVault tokens that receives a share of the protocol fees by serving as a counterparty to trader wins & losses.
The history price of gUSDC can be publicly viewed on our dune dashboard linked above. It has generally been an “up-only” asset with the exception of a few dips shortly after the launch of the asset back in January.
The historical price of gUSDC can be found here: https://dune.com/queries/3385617/5681244

**Motivation:**

> Gains Network aims to enable a gauge for a gUSDC / USDC pool to significantly increase the liquidity for gUSDC on secondary markets to set the foundation for more integrations with the purpose of expanding its utility across Arbitrum DeFi.

**Specifications:**
 
>Gains Network will utilize a part of its STIP.B LP incentives budget to bootstrap more (sticky) liquidity for the [gUSDC](https://gains.trade/vaults/gUSDC) vault as it anticipates more USDC-collateral usage on gTrade over the coming months. Initially, the focus will be on building liquidity on partner DEXs for gUSDC/USDC pools, including this Balancer pool. This strategy aims to unlock various partnership opportunities, creating an ecosystem around gUSDC through lending markets, LP-strategy protocols, and more.
Gains Network is seeking to co-incentivize this pool with Balancer to establish the required liquidity as a foundation for said gUSDC integrations and consecutively form a long-term partnership with Balancer as one of the main venues for gUSDC since Gains Network believes Balancer is a pool that can largely be maintained beyond incentives through swapping fees post the bootstrapping phase.

1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    

>The incentives distributor is governed by the following Multisig address: [0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D
](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D)And, Gains Network is actively working towards being a DAO governed through the $GNS token.

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

> gTrade leverages their own custom-built Chainlink decentralized oracle network (DON) to provide real-time, aggregated prices for their leveraged trading products. Their oracle architecture uses a custom DON to supply on-demand prices to an aggregator contract while the official Chainlink Price Feeds serve as anchors, meaning if their price differs by more than 1.5% from Chainlink Price Feeds, a circuit breaker is triggered.

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

> Audits are conducted with each upgrade Gains Network undergoes. With the release of [V8 in May](https://medium.com/gains-network/introducing-gtrade-v8-diamond-refactor-and-smart-contract-integration-a175b96ccb82), the entire codebase has been audited. Moreover, the release of [V9](https://x.com/GainsNetwork_io/status/1807877092836610406) [current version] has been audited as well.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

> We will state our centralization vectors by giving insights into our most centralized facet: the DON. The current custom decentralized oracle network is operated by 8 independent chainlink node operators & 1 price feed from StorkOracle.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

>There’s no information available on the Balancer pool yet as it’s yet to be launched. 
However, the gUSDC asset is tradeable on a Ramses CL pool as per June 15th and started to get incentivized with $ARB from June 27th onwards. The pool is currently sitting at $2M TVL and can be found here: https://ramses.exchange/liquidity/v2/0xe9e3ef12f1f9dbaf7b7f57ab262c54117448884b 
Since the inception of this secondary market pool, Gains Network vaults have been consistently overcollateralized while the gUSDC asset has never been below peg and has not experienced significant volatility. Considering the ‘up-only’ nature of gTokens and gUSDC currently sitting at a 124.1% collateralization ratio, the price of gUSDC is expected to continue its upwards price action as time passes. 

 
6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) 

>The pool will not serve as the primary source of liquidity in the bootstrapping phase, but will be leveraged as the primary source of liquidity once the bootstrapping phase has passed. 
The pool can generate consistent fees due to gUSDC depositors only being able to use Balancer as a means of exiting before our epoch system, looping through lending markets & liquidations through lending markets.

#### PancakeSwap and Token Supply

The state of DeFi and PancakeSwap has changed immensely since our inception in September 2020, and we propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750,000,000 (750M) to better reflect our long-term outlook on PancakeSwap and the $CAKE token.

#### Current PancakeSwap Tokenomics

In the kitchen, we have been working hard to bring value to PancakeSwap and the $CAKE token, from providing new products (e.g. Perpetuals), to sourcing the tastiest Syrup Pools and Farms. Unique amongst AMMs, we also burn transaction fees from platform activities (e.g. trading, prediction, farm auctions) to further increase the scarcity of the $CAKE token.

**But we can do better, and we will.**

#### Proposed Cap on CAKE Maximum Token Supply

We propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M $CAKE. Based on our calculations – which can be found in detail in our [**litepaper v2**](https://v2litepaper.pancakeswap.finance/) – this comfortably gives us an approximate runway of 3 years, before the current circulating supply reaches this cap. 

We believe that implementing this proposed cap will enable the $CAKE token to better reflect the value, community, and sustainability of PancakeSwap.

#### What’s next?

If the community decides to approve the proposal to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M, we will formally incorporate it into our tokenomics, and institute the max token supply cap.

323,"[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/dzar-removal-from-whitelist-proposal/252).

After some explanations from what looked like DZAR team, my conclusion about the discussion we had in bal-detectives channel on Discord is:

""DZAR tokens are backed by nothing. Buyers have no claims to Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd's assets which own the deposits that you make to get DZAR. The DZAR peg to ZAR (fiat currency) is kept at voluntary efforts of Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd. and the pegging can be terminated at any point in time at discretion of Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd.""

DZAR can print unlimited amounts of tokens at their sole discretion.

DZAR gets pooled in many 8 asset pools. These pools are as safe as the weakest currency, DZAR going to 0 will drain these pools to 0. There are millions in these pools. If DZAR prints unlimited amount of tokens, it will drain all these pools, generate large losses and bad publicity.

I think that encouraging DZAR liquidity on Balancer creates a big risk for potential liquidity providers joining these pools.",bullish

328,"The Venus community delegators are submitting this proposal on behalf of OpenZeppelin. 

Summary

OpenZeppelin has proposed a Security Partnership with Venus protocol for performing security audits on retainer. 

OpenZeppeling currently planned list of audits for Venus new product releases are:

-New Liquidator contract
-Diamond Comptroller
-Automatic allocation of income and Prime contract
-Collecting needed tokens and Shortfall handling (Automated Treasury Management)

As Venus’s trusted security partner, OpenZeppelin will perform continuous security audits of Venus codebases and provide actionable feedback to help the development team improve smart contract security. They offer a total of 24 weeks of security research time to be used over the next 6 months for audits as directed by the Venus dev team, which includes fix reviews and a high-level analysis of current protocol security. The total cost is $554,400 to be paid in USDC on a quarterly schedule from the Venus treasury, starting with $277,200 at the start of Q3 2023 followed by the same amount at the start of Q4.

About OpenZeppelin

OpenZeppelin is a leading blockchain infrastructure security firm that performs security audits and provides developer tools for decentralized systems that power multimillion-dollar economies. OpenZeppelin has set industry standards for building secure, decentralized systems and has gained the trust of industry leaders including Coinbase, the Ethereum Foundation, Matter Labs, and the original Compound protocol.

329,"**TL;DR:**

   * Keep Badger emissions for ibBTC and bcvxCRV on Ethereum, renBTC and Badger/WBTC on Arbitrum; remove the rest.
   * Allocate up to 8k Badger per week for testing new emissions programs/bribing/etc to be allocated at the discretion of the Badger Council.
   * Keep DIGG emissions the same as Q1 2022.
   * The net result is 20,000 BADGER per week emitted from the treasury in Q2 vs. 27,802 in the last week of Q1. This is a 28% reduction in emissions.
   * bveCVX is currently buying more than 12k BADGER per week and distributing it to its HODLers. This both creates buy pressure for more than half the treasury emitted tokens and makes up for the reduction in emissions to other Vaults.

330,"**Summary:**

A proposal by the Mechanism.Capital 13 team to create a Curve Metapool for Empty Set Dollar (ESD) and the 3Pool stablecoins (USDC, USDT, and DAI).

ESD has been one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins launched to date. Its market capitalization has grown to over $65 million in the ~2 months since its inception (peaked near $100 million).

The unique mechanism design of the protocol makes it a strong candidate to become one of the largest stable collateral assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

Creating an ESD metapool would attract more liquidity to the Curve platform and lead to increased trading fees.

Learn more about metapools here: https://resources.curve.fi/faq/base-and-metapools 1

**Abstract:**

Empty Set Dollar (ESD) is a new algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin that utilizes fixed protocol rules on supply expansion as well as a unique coupon creation + redemption model to incentivize trustless coordination between selfish participants that maintain ESD’s synthetic peg 1:1 with the US dollar all on-chain. Unlike other algorithmic stable coins like AMPL, ESD does not rebase all balances using non-standard functions, but instead adjusts supply through other mechanisms, allowing ESD to have the same composability as other standard ERC20 tokens.

Currently, crypto lacks a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoin. While DAI and sUSD come close, they currently have vulnerabilities in their architecture. The goal of ESD is to create a truly permissionless, scaleable, stable store of value, that can be used as superfluid collateral in DeFi.

Note: ESD currently only incentivizes the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool. In order to motivate more liquidity to flow to this Curve metapool, ESD holders would have to vote to upgrade ESD to incentivize this new pool. However, various ESD community members have already expressed their support for such a prospective proposal to reward Curve LPs.

*Liquidity:*

Total Uniswap Liquidity as of 11/3/2020: $1.52 million

Avg. Daily Trading Volume (Last 14 Days ended 11/3/2020): $3.75 million

*Token Holder Distribution:*

As of 11/4/2020 there are currently over 853 unique addresses holding ESD. This includes 668 staked addresses.

Over 90% of ESD tokens were staked to the DAO as of 11/3/2020.

**Motivation:**

This is an opportunity for Curve to attract more liquidity to its platform and increase trading fees. It would also benefit the ESD community by increasing the efficiency of ESD turnover and accelerating ESD contraction & expansion cycles to further stabilize the price of the token around $1. Finally, accelerating the growth of ESD would enhance the antifragility of the entire DeFi ecosystem due to ESD’s unique characteristics relative to other stable assets.

**Specification:**

This metapool would include ESD, USDC, USDT, and DAI. It is likely that the ESD protocol community would vote to incentivize this Curve metapool. It already does this for the ESD/USDC pool on Uniswap: https://emptyset.finance/#/pool/

**For:**

This pool would bring more liquidity and fees to the Curve protocol.

It would also help accelerate and dampen the volatility ESD’s expansion/contraction cycles, which are currently delayed due to the limitations of slippage on the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool.

Successful passage of this proposal would show the Curve community’s willingness to support new, innovative protocols – specifically those focused on open and permissionless access to DeFi.

**Against:**

ESD is a relatively new and experimental protocol. There are both known and unknown risks to explore as the protocol matures. These include, but are not limited to:

ESD is expected to trade within a narrow band around US$1.00, but has experienced short periods of significant volatility

A downward spiral in the instance of zero demand for new coupons (though in the current contraction period, over 26m coupons have been purchased)

Smart contract bugs (code is currently under audit); and

A design flaw that leads to an economic attack (see the recent Harvest Finance attack 1).

https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/403

### Motivation

Per Coinbase's recent public communications the official public launch of Base is likely to be in early August. Balancer contributors are actively working to ensure Balancer is available from day 1 which was authorized with the passing of [BIP-263](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-263-deploy-balancer-to-base/4663). I request an initial allocation of 50,000 USDC from the treasury to be used towards Base launch incentives. This would be used over a period of no less than one month post launch. Another proposal will be put forward at that time if circumstances warrant additional funding. 

It's difficult to present any hard numbers because the network is not live yet and we don't know what will be available on launch day. The reasons I think funding incentives pre-launch is a good idea are the following:

* Balancer would be one of a small number of dapps with active incentives on launch day

* We'll start strong which is likely to bring interest from other Base projects

* Gives us the ability to match partner incentives for a period of time 

How quickly these funds are spent will depend on what opportunities present themselves and what activity the network is seeing post launch. 

The Balancer Maxis will be responsible for allocating these funds.

### Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will transfer 50,000 USDC to the Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`.",neutral
332,"### Motivation 

As part of the Arbitrum token launch [Balancer DAO was allocated ~3M ARB tokens ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSSAzkIIJqw4WGKCF9gXFUkQojTt6weQTExZYmp3YRIR2TUjir9N8nh8xg7gQ2wuPA8mJKL2neL--to/pubhtml). While spending some to accelerate our growth certainly makes sense I believe it’s prudent to retain the majority as a long term bet on Arbitrum’s future. Balancer has seen promising early signs of momentum on Arbitrum like the launch of wstETH, rETH, Aave v3 boosted pools, and the adoption of ve8020 by two Arbitrum native projects (y2k and Radiant). Future catalysts like Aura going multichain, bridging over more rate providers like cbETH, and gyroscope's ECLP put us in a strong position to potentially become the top DEX on Arbitrum.

**I suggest allocating 1M ARB towards direct LP incentives as this is the most direct growth mechanism in my view.**

The USD amount of bribes placed has fallen significantly in line with the decline in BAL & AURA prices. If we use ARB to bribe I believe we’ll only accelerate the reduction in 3rd party bribing activity as we push the ROI closer to 1:1. I’d argue this leads to no gain at all for voters and would be a waste of 1M ARB.

Directly emitting ARB on the pools seems to be a better option as that increases the amount of emissions up for grabs, thus pushing the ROI for bribers up rather than down. Of course this program is limited to incentivizing Arbitrum pools so it is fair to say only the ROI for Arbitrum bribers goes up - more Arbitrum bribers pushes down the ROI for everyone else and these two things cancel each other out to a large extent. Bottom line is more total emissions should lead to more bribes given we’re effectively pushing 1:1 ROI lately.

I’ll propose the following rule set:

* 10 round duration, aligning with Aura’s two week cycle of voting incentive allocations.
* Max of 100k ARB per round. Any unspent ARB simply returns to the treasury.
* Each pool can have a max possible allocation of 10k ARB per round to prevent one or two pools from taking the majority share of this program.
* On each Wednesday/Thursday after Aura’s gauge voting snapshot, ARB will be allocated to each Arbitrum pool according to bribes placed in the most recent round on a 1:1 USD basis, subject to ARB caps mentioned above.
* This ARB will be emitted over a two week period
* All voting markets are included - projects can choose where to bribe at their discretion. Bribes placed by Balancer under BIP-19 also count.
* Balancer Maxis will publish a spreadsheet detailing the ARB allocation every two weeks and allow at least 24h for community feedback before execution. We’ll make a forum thread for this purpose.
* This would not begin until the first Aura voting round after Aura is deployed and ready to emit AURA rewards.

**For the remaining 2M ARB I suggest deploying protocol owned liquidity in combination with Aura by pairing it 33/33/33 with BAL and AURA.**

Aura recently passed [AIP-25](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-25-approve-aura-for-arbitrum-liquidity/461) to signal their support for this. Fry (aura contributor) has deployed an [escrow contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8D803f7f7e26E586ee90E5A872cf7830e21f7727#writeContract) to hold the BPT which has been reviewed by Balancer's integrations team. 

This creates TVL, volume, and revenue that we don’t need to spend incentives on. By increasing BAL & AURA liquidity on Arbitrum we make it easier for second order integrations like autocompounders to support Balancer pools. If another use case for ARB presents itself like participating in governance or another incentives program the liquidity can always be withdrawn.

### Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the official Arbitrum bridge at https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ using the wallet connect app in gnosis safe. 
Based on current market prices and factoring in a ~5% cushion,  500k BAL will be bridged and should be sufficient for  LP.   Any remaining BAL will be held in the DAO multisig on Arbitrum.  The destination address will be `arb1:0xaF23DC5983230E9eEAf93280e312e57539D098D0` the Arbitrum Balancer Treasury.  A small test transaction will be executed before the majority of the funds are sent in the multisig execution the week following the test. 

Once Aura lets us know they're ready to send AURA to the escrow contract the Arbitrum Treasury `arb1:0xaF23DC5983230E9eEAf93280e312e57539D098D0` will transfer 2M ARB and some amount of BAL up to the 500k max, based on current market prices, to `0x8D803f7f7e26E586ee90E5A872cf7830e21f7727`. Aura's multisig will then call init() and join().

335,"#### Upgrade of Coin98’s Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift Coin98’s Farm rewards from the current C98-BNB v2 LP to the new C98-BNB v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the C98-BNB v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the C98 token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current C98 price.)

To ensure a smooth transition between v2 and v3 pairs, there will be an overlap of one day where there will be incentives directed towards both farms. This will occur on 18 May 2023. 

After **0830 UTC on 18 May 2023**, only the v3 pair will receive incentives, so users are encouraged to migrate in advance of this time.

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new Farm will have doubled emissions for the first 7 days. For example, if the v2 farm emits 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will emit 20 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 10 CAKE per day thereafter.

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake C98-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 1x multiplier
- **49 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.25% fee tier):
- Stake C98-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 2.4x multiplier (4.8x multiplier for the first 7 days)
- 98 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and **49 CAKE per day** thereafter 

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 2.4x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### Key timelines

* **Launch of C98-BNB v3 farm:** Approx. 0830 UTC on 18 May 2023
* **Sunset of C98-BNB v2 farm:** Approx. 0830 UTC on 19 May 2023

#### How to migrate?

Please remember to shift your LP to the new farm before the v2 farm sunsets.

Please refer to the following [**link**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/code/v3-migration/how-to-migrate) for migration instructions

#### What is Coin98?

Coin98 is a DeFi product builder focusing on creating and developing an ecosystem of DeFi protocols, Web3 applications, and NFTs on multiple blockchains.

#### What is $C98?
From the team: “C98 is the native utility token of the Coin98 DeFi platform, powering the entire ecosystem. C98 plays an important role in operating the Coin98 ecosystem, and at the same time brings profits to holders and rights for long-term development. This includes but is not limited to staking, governance, unique membership rights, and platform fees.”

338,"## TLDR;
graviAURA tokens inside of a Balancer gauge will not overvote for the guage they are in if the gauge has 10% or more of the total vote weight. The graviAURA vote weight will instead vote for core pools based on the bribe distribution with 90% of its vote weight and the usual 10% vote weight fee will be taken by BadgerDAO.

## Outcome:
The above fix will align the interests of BadgerDAO, BalancerDAO, naked graviAURA depositors and graviAURA LPs in gauges. This will also allow for large veBAL holders to still overvote for graviAURA pools but with diminishing returns.

Using the excess vote weight to vote for bribes will align with Balancer core pools and drive emissions to pools earning the highest fees. This is ideal compared to voting for specific pools as it allows graviAURA to better follow natural market forces and not overvote for pools in an ever changing landscape.

A 3 month time limit will ensure that any interested parties can take the time to bring more complete governance to the table as more data becomes available.

This partnership would provide significant benefits for the Venus community by expanding the utility of XVS in the real world through travel bookings. The marketing support and exposure provided by Travala, along with the convenience of booking with preferred cryptocurrencies, would further enhance the integration's appeal. 

Travala's established presence in the travel industry, with major partnerships and a Best Price Guarantee policy, offers a strong foundation for this collaboration. 

By leveraging Travala's platform, Venus can tap into a large user base that is already accustomed to using cryptocurrencies for travel bookings. The proposal's focus on boosting XVS's utility and accessibility aligns well with the strategic vision of both the Venus community and Travala.

342,"**Summary:**
FIAT DAO is seeking the preliminary approval of veBAL gauges for two yet-to-be-deployed stableswap pools.

- **FIAT-USDC-DAI**
- **FIAT-FEI-FRAX**

This comes after the successful migration of our governance token $FDT’s liquidity to the Balancer platform over the past month.

**References/Useful links:**

- **[App](https://app.fiatdao.com)**
- **[Docs](https://docs.fiatdao.com)**
- **[Dune](https://dune.com/1ab/FIAT)**
- **[Github](https://github.com/fiatdao)**
- **[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/fiatdao)**

**Protocol Description:**
The FIAT protocol is a DeFi-native repo market solution for providing liquidity to holders of fixed income assets. It allows users of apps like Element Finance, Notional Finance, and Yield Protocol to bring their proofs of liquidity to the protocol in order to collateralize a debt position in $FIAT, a stable value asset. Our v1 has just launched, and it’ll look and feel familiar for users who have previously minted DAI, RAI, or MIM. By utilizing proven stablecoin mechanisms, the protocol is able to offer competitive borrowing power to holders of such collateral assets, allowing them to releverage fixed yields or meet current liabilities as the locked assets mature. You can learn more about its primary use case via [this thread](https://twitter.com/wjvill/status/1527680960866705408) from Element founder Will Villanueva.

**The success of FIAT is predicated on its ability to attract secondary liquidity.** In its current iteration, it is pooling secondary liquidity around a singular asset, drawing forward demand for an otherwise fragmented universe of collateral backing. Unique to FIAT versus other CDP implementations is that fixed term collateral forces users to repay back their debt at a known point in time, lest they bear negative yields due to FIAT interest accrual on those positions thereafter - this allows for higher maximum LTVs and potentially more trading fees for LPs. Currently, only stablecoin-denominated collateral is supported by the protocol, so any risk premium is a function of smart contract concerns or changes in prevailing yields.

**Motivation:**
Over the course of its first month in existence, $FIAT has had its liquidity subsidized on Curve via a discretionary budget. Over the same time, liquidity for our governance token has been ported to Balancer. We’ve been very pleased with the migration and think it makes sense to follow suit with $FIAT here in its early days.

A number of items excite us about the opportunity:

- The presence of boosted staBAL and now FEI-FRAX-DAI pools will allow for user pathways that involve depositing into either, minting FIAT, and selling FIAT for more of the underlying in order to gain levered fixed exposure. **This results in locked TVL for Balancer and higher trading fees for Balancer LPs.**

- With Hidden Hand, it will become possible to have a larger consortium of projects actively subsidize FIAT LPs. We anticipate that all of our collateral partners with associated ERC-20 tokens will see the value in deeper FIAT liquidity for their protocols. And for other stableswap pools that exist on Balancer, deeper FIAT liquidity increases the odds of locked TVL in their pools.

- The user experience associated with veBAL and Hidden Hand is more clear than our current Curve → Rari Fuse flow.

**What we would like to discuss in this thread, however, is the deployment of the stableswap pools themselves.** Given the nature of FIAT (i.e. CDP architecture, stablecoin backing, audited collateral issuers), we would be interested to hear what members of the Balancer DAO have to say regarding their comfort with varying levels of potential [A coefficients](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/math/stable-math). If you have any specific thoughts regarding this topic, please share your opinion in the thread!

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** FIAT DAO is a completely on-chain organization, with no corresponding real world entity in place. The FDT token has been given away for free since November of 2021, and a DAO smart contract architecture has been live since December 2021.

2. **Oracles:** $FDT is a standard ERC-20 DeFi governance token that comes with the volatility inherent to the sector. $FIAT is a DAI-like asset that will come to be backed by less liquid derivatives, but at the moment only supports collateral types with existing secondary markets.

3. **Audits:** Audits of our protocol and our collateral oracle system can be found in the [Security](https://github.com/fiatdao/security) repo within our Github.

4. **Centralization Vectors:** $FDT holders determine which assets are supported as collateral and the parameters associated with each. A six of eleven guardian multisig currently holds certain emergency privileges.

5. **Market History:** $FIAT has been transferable since April 2022. It previously reached a high watermark of $1.3M deposited on Curve.

We would like to take this to a vote now that the FUD pool is live.

0x Labs would like to gather signal from the community on support for the proposed Metatransaction and Multiplex upgrades as proposed in [ZEIP-96](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/96).

## Scope

The forum post on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-96-metatransactionsfeaturev2-and-multiplex-upgrades/3543](https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-96-metatransactionsfeaturev2-and-multiplex-upgrades/3543).

In summary, the proposed changes will provide two main benefits: (1) improve gas efficiency of the metatransaction feature and (2) enable OTC order formats to be included in multihop transactions that would expand the sources of liquidity that can be considered and make meta-aggregation more price competitive.

A subsequent vote (ZEIP-96) will be conducted if this temperature check is successful to integrate the proposed smart contract changes to the `exchangeProxy`.

346,"The M-Token team proposes adding a [MBTC, [sBTC pool]] Metapool. Adding a MBTC pool will further increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum and make it easier to swap between assets.

Hello everyone,

We are M-Token team. Today, we would like to introduce M-Tokens, and initiate the proposal to add the MBTC Metapool on the Curve platform.
First of all, MBTC is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum issued by M-Tokens on a 1:1 basis peg to actual Bitcoin. This enables seamless integration of crypto assets on other blockchains into the Ethereum ecosystem and brings the community another choice to enjoy the cross-chain transaction with convenience, transparency, and value.

All M-Tokens reserves are safeguarded by qualified custodians. At the current stage, M-Token is supported by Cactus Custody, who manages private keys in the industry high-level HSMs and its proprietary multi-tiered storage system by the tier-4 grade data centers across three continents. Its segregation of duty and zero-trust system design can guarantee the safety and availability of the assets without dependency on any single individual. Meanwhile, a multi-signature mechanism is adopted by M-Tokens for its crucial aspects such as mining and burning, allowing on-the-chain verification. Thus, it provides cross-chain asset services that are both transparent and reliable. Major parties taking part in M-Tokens include the governing bodies, custodians, merchants, and the end users.

In terms of technical aspects, smart contact and hash mapping are adopted. Simultaneously, the reserve deposit addresses, outstanding balances, and transaction records are made 100% public and traceable to enable exact cross-chain mapping. In terms of governance, checks and balances are achieved through a multi-institutional framework, roles/rights segregation, and decentralization, facilitating the prevention of malice committed by any individual or entity. Moreover, the blacklisting mechanism lays a foundation for ongoing governance and regulatory compliance.

M-Token has currently collaborated with SynFutures protocol, where its users can use MBTC to trade the derivatives product on the platform. M-Token has also partnered with Matrixport on industry-leading crypto financial solutions, which will empower M-Token with the capacity of yield generating in the future. Most importantly, the capability to conduct structural products and become a gateway between DeFi and CeFi will be the parts we focus on, and it definitely is our unique advantage.

We believe that adding the MBTC pool will increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum, and enable the BTC holders invest their assets into Ethereum projects in a convenient, speedy and cost-effective manner.

Audits Security Reviews:
M-Tokens & MBTC has been audited by Peckshield. 

MBTC Market Cap: [Will be updated]
Currently, MBTC total supply is “200”.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new **90 days** Syrup Pool with XCAD Network! 

XCAD Network is a content creator tokenization platform where users can earn and trade their favourite creators' tokens.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn XCAD tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 285,800 XCAD
 - **Distribution duration:** 90 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 9 Nov 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 7 Feb 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.1102 XCAD

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the XCAD Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing an XCAD-CAKE farm.  


The farm will have 0.5x CAKE rewards for the first 7 days, then 0.2x rewards after that. At the end of the 90-day period – approx. 1100 UTC on 7 Feb 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0.1x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.2x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $XCAD?

From the team: “The use cases of XCAD are as follows:

- Govern creator’s decisions via a plugin which works directly on YouTube
- Stake to get access to Creator Liquidity Offering (CLO) - Launchpad for creators
- Stake to earn fan tokens on the Google Chrome Plug-in”

352,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-balancer-labs-to-emergency-pause/2399).

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable a multisig controlled by Balancer Labs team members to control the Boosted Pools emergency pause mechanism during its first 3 months.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) have an emergency pause period which is **hardcoded at 3 months** from the time the factories were deployed. During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. **Funds can always be withdrawn by users** , even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.

Since gathering 6/11 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also **authorizing a Balancer Labs controlled multisig to pause the system** . The [BLabs Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B) will be controlled by a handful of team members at Balancer Labs. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Governance Multisig nor the BLabs Multisig will have any pause power.

An important distinction between the pause mechanism in Boosted Pools and that of previous pool types and of the vault is that Boosted Pools are not supposed to be unpaused. In practice, after a pool is paused users should withdraw assets from the pool and a new pool should be deployed. In the event that the pause mechanism must be triggered, Balancer Labs will commit resources to draw attention from liquidity providers to the fact that they must withdraw their funds.

## Specification

The Balancer governance multisig on Ethereum Mainnet ( `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` ) would submit a transaction to the Authorizer ( `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` ) in order to grant the following roles to a Multisig controlled by Balancer Labs ( `0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B` ):

We are thrilled to present this budget proposal on behalf of Aave Companies and our ongoing commitment to support the Aave Community. This proposal will enable the Aave DAO and Aave Companies to collaborate and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem and drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption at key events like DevConnect, rAAVE, and ETHGlobal Istanbul.

# History
Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, and stakeholders.

Aave Companies recognizes the fundamental importance of the Aave Grants DAO in nurturing the DeFi ecosystem and has consistently provided support to the AGD through direct collaboration. Historically, Aave Companies has worked alongside AGD to bring sponsorship and presence at hackathons and events, designed and created the highly coveted Aave merch, and brought rAAVE to life in various cities across the globe.

# Overview
Aave Companies is requesting a budget allocation of $550,000 paid in GHO for the remainder of 2023 to support a range of activations and events to continue growing and nurturing the global Aave Community. These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:
1. Sponsoring Hackathons: Aave Companies intends to sponsor hackathons to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as the new stablecoin, GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2 but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem.
2. Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences allows the Aave community to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge and industry insights. These events often include panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts. Side events are also where Aave is able to show our commitment to inclusivity and diversity in the web3 ecosystem by tapping into new communities and audiences. We’re proud to be supporters of groups such as SheFi and BoysClub.
3. Merch: Aave Companies recognizes the importance of high-quality merchandise in building brand recognition. We intend to continue to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement efforts as well as to proliferate the ghost. We will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials, and creating merch people actually wear, use, and love.
4. Development of the GHO Pass: With one of the core missions of the Aave community being to grow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity, we’re excited to announce Aave Companies’ development of the GHO Pass. The GHO Pass V1 will facilitate GHO purchases at both Aave events and events we sponsor. We plan to launch GHO Pass at DevConnect, where users can get early access to a select group of rAAVE tickets and drink credits, exclusive merch, and other perks.
5. rAAVE: To celebrate and give back to the Aave community, we plan to host another edition of our vibrant and highly demanded event, rAAVE. Such events serve as an excellent opportunity for building “hype” around the Aave brand and creating a memorable experience for the Aave community. We will also explore live streaming rAAVE, and integrating GHO pass (as mentioned above). We will continue to manage ticketing logistics, press relations, as well as rAAVE social media.

# Activations
Activations continue to be a key focus and driver of growth for the Aave ecosystem thanks to:
- Creating a welcoming, engaging and memorable experience at the Aave booth.
- Sponsoring side events, hackathons, prizes and providing exceptional support to developers.
- Spreading Aave’s culture by distributing highly coveted merchandise.
- Selectively hosting rAAVEs to bring the Aave community together, reward contributors and make Aave the top ecosystem in crypto.
- Developing GHO Pass payment portal.

| ETH Global Istanbul  | Nov 17-19  | During the week of Devconnect. ETHGlobal puts on arguably the most reputable hackathon events in the Ethereum ecosystem. Istanbul is a community with substantial and growing crypto adoption and is a prime market to engage hackers and the community with Aave and GHO.  |
| rAAVE  | Nov TBD  | rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem. We will host one rAAVE during the course of this proposal that is powered by GHO to help spread adoption and awareness.  |
| Devconnect + Side Events  | Nov 13-19  | This will be the event of the year in the Ethereum community. Hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, this event will be one of the most attended web3 events of 2023. Activating here will allow us to reach a wide audience and connect with many from our community.  |
| Side Events	  | Q4  | Side events we’re currently considering include: SheFi Summit Istanbul, Certora at DevConnect, Scroll Day, notDevcon by ITU Blockchain, StableSummit Istanbul. Funds from any side events that are not confirmed will be rolled over to the next potential side event.  |

For this proposal, Aave Companies is focusing on sponsoring fewer events, while increasing the quality of Aave’s presence.

A majority of the new event spend will be used to have an impactful presence during Devconnect, ETHGlobal Istanbul, and rAAVE in order to drive hackers to build with GHO and to increase GHO utilization within the wider community. Since Devconnect week will be the marquee event of the year, any remaining budget after our main sponsorships will be allocated to side events related to DeFi or Smart Contract Security.

# Next Steps
- If Snapshot is successful then move to AIP

# Conclusion
Aave Companies is deeply committed to the Aave community. We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of $550,000 paid in GHO for activations and events will not only enrich the ecosystem but also foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition. We look forward to the DAO’s support in enabling these initiatives to come to life and continue to drive the growth of the Aave ecosystem. We will rollover excess budget to Q1 2024 events.",bullish

# Summary

As a recap, on 13 April 2022, a [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-incorporation-of-the-balancer-foundation/2989) was brought to the BalancerDAO (or the “DAO”) to incorporate the Balancer Foundation (or the “Foundation”). The Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work, furthering Balancer’s decentralization goals, and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.

The Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate, and provides, among others, two primary benefits:

It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts. In addition, for example, it intends to establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto.

It encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, it could engage business development or tech providers.

In short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the BalancerDAO in the structure of the traditional business world.

The Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.

Running a Foundation Company comes with certain real-world costs and financial reserve requirements. These are laid out below, first in summary and then in detail for reference.

## Specification - Foundation Expenses and reserves

This proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2022 running through March 2023, and a self-insurance reserve.

### Foundation Expenses

The summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.

The Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, so April / May /June is the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, although it is the first quarter for which funding is requested.

1. Q2 FY22 - USDC 32,941 - actual expenses incurred through the end of May 2022 and forecast for June 2022 - immediate payment requested
2. Q3 FY22 - USDC 67,919 - for transfer 25 June 2022
3. Q4 FY22 - USDC 67,969 - for transfer 25 September 2022
4. Q1 FY23 - USDC 78,384 - for transfer 15 December 2022

The table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter. Descriptions for each line item are included under the “Detail” section further below.

![|624x417.174903581549](upload://vPqyfiEv162ngVFJ64ipxJDv5Ii.jpeg)

### Foundation Self Insurance Reserve

As part of this proposal, we are asking BalancerDAO to hold the equivalent of US$500,000 as a self-insurance reserve, earmarked for a year and to be revisited after a year. The reserve can be maintained in BAL tokens given current market conditions, but must at all times be available to the Foundation should it be needed, and must be maintained at an equivalent value of US$500,000. More on this reserve requirement can be found in the “Detail” section below.

Note: the proposal is for funding at the Balancer Foundation level, it does not include funding for:

1. Balancer OpCo Limited, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) subsidiary and operating company that will house the front-end development team for BalancerDAO,
2. Other third-party service providers to the BalancerDAO, such as Orb Collective and Kolektivo Labs.

Proposals for funding these three entities will follow separately.

# Detail

For reference, please see below descriptions of the individual line items.

## Annual Secretary Fee

Under Cayman Law, a foundation company must at all times have a secretary who is a 'qualified person' (i.e. a person licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services). The secretary has a duty to ensure that the company complies with applicable Cayman Islands legislation governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.

Neither the secretary fee nor the registered office fee includes the preparation of minutes and resolutions. The Foundation will prepare these for typical matters but might seek assistance from Campbells if complex matters arise.

These fees are due in January each year.

## Registered Office and Registrar of Companies fees (via Campbells Corporate Services Cayman)

Annual registered office and registrar fee – US$2,915.12, which consists of:

- Registered Office fee of US$ 1,495.00

- Beneficial Ownership Reporting and Register Maintenance Fee of US$225.00

- Economic Substance Notification Fee of US$125.00

- Registrar Annual Return Fee of US$853.66

- Supplementary Registered Office License Fee of US$91.46

- Sundry Disbursements of US$125.00

Includes:

- providing the registered office and registered agent

- maintaining the statutory registers

- preparation and submission of annual returns

- filing economic substance notifications

- maintaining the UBO register and reporting on the same

These fees are due in January each year.

## Additional Campbells Corporate Services costs

Any legal advice that may be requested from time to time will be charged on a time spent basis. Any additional corporate requests (for example, requests for certificates, certified documents, updates to registers, filing changes, mail forward, etc – these are all in addition to the annual fees) will also be charged separately.

## Governance/Supervisory Services

### Non-Executive Director and Supervisor Responsibilities

Under the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.

“Supervisor”, for a foundation company, means a person, other than a member, who under the foundation company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.

The non-executive director responsibilities are:

* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors
* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation
* To work with the wider board of directors to:
  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;
  * set an agenda for board meetings;
  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate
* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate
* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission
* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary
* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director
* Set the tone to involve the Balancer ecosystem in developing long-range programs to support and increase all types of contributions to Balancer projects
* Set the tone to harmonize the ecosystem working with the board, the service providers, and projects and adjacent foundations to find opportunities to collaborate and reduce confusion.

### Community Board Member duties

The Directors have ultimate responsibility for the management of the Foundation. In particular, the Director’s responsibilities will include:

* complying with all reasonable requests, instructions and regulations made or given by the Board (or by any duly authorized committee thereof) and give to the Board such explanations, information, and assistance the Board may reasonably require

* attending all meetings of the Board in person or by video/phone; provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary, as applicable, with reasonable advance notice; and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances;

* bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO, strategy, policy, resources, performance, and regulatory matters;

* providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, adherence to terms set forth in the Articles;

* planning, developing, and enhancing the future strategic direction of the DAO

* sharing responsibility with the other director(s) of the Company for the effective management of the Company

### CEO/Management duties

The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Foundation, which includes the following roles:

1. Liaising with the board on all budgets, project proposals, and matters particularly as it relates to service providers including the BVI subsidiary

* Reporting to the board in a timely manner on all matters of importance including financial status, funding projections, policy setting, planning, program operations, employee matters, and the long-term health of the ecosystem.
* Providing adequate materials and analysis to assist the board in making decisions on all matters of importance.

2. Manage Finances and Service Providers

* Overseeing all financial management of the Foundation, including budgets for Board approval, grant, and funding administration required by either the Foundation or other supporters. Possessing thorough knowledge of all funding sources and required records.
* Maintaining and adapting the organizational structure and systems capable of meeting the needs of the Foundation in carrying out its mission.
* Overseeing BVI subsidiary operations including staff and logins as needed (Twitter, GitHub, Discord). Contracts with BVI for service providers.
* Setting up and administering the Foundation’s bank account
* Setting up and managing token custodian

3. Involving the board, ecosystem participants, service provider staff as needed in developing organizational goals, a strategic plan, and projections for supporting the Balancer mission through service providers (Orb Collective Inc and BVI subsidiary) and the community.

* Overseeing vendors & others involved in actively seeking software and product developments and funds as needed.
* Ensuring that the Balancer projects delegated to service providers and the ecosystem have clear objectives that are within the scope of the resources and mission of the Foundation.
* Overseeing the gathering, analysis, and reporting of data illustrating the work accomplished by service providers to manage performance and deliverables
* Reviewing program evaluation results and developing and executing strategies for continual improvement.

4. Compliance

* Responsible for all necessary filings, responses to inquiries, management of AML Compliance vendor, and other Cayman Foundation compliance and risk-related matters

5. and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation.

## Legal Counsel

The Foundation may from time to time require advice on matters of Cayman law. It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item. We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter. For clarity, this refers to the legal team rather than the corporate services team.

## Self Insurance

It is typical for an organization to obtain insurance to protect itself against the legal, regulatory and operational risks, as well as to protect the directors and officers from personal liability for carrying out their duties. We have not seen reasonable insurance for organizations of this nature in the market, hence the need to self-insure.

We are asking for $500,000 based on the costs of defending Balancer in the event of a regulatory inquiry, class action or other lawsuit or vulnerability to the ecosystem. The self-insurance is based on recent DeFi matters within the last 12 months which have cost on average $100,000 monthly to defend. It is important to note, that we have excluded any reserve for payment of damages, fines, or impact on users.

Since this is a reserve and not an expense, the Directors may assess in the future that a lower reserve amount becomes sufficient and propose changes to the DAO. We are asking that the DAO bookmarks these funds to hold for self-insurance.

## Bank Fees

The Foundation is working to establish a bank relationship that we are advised could take approximately 6-8 weeks once the application is complete and submitted. This line item is an estimate/placeholder for monthly fees

## Accounting Software

Estimate for monthly software subscription fees.

title: ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token
status: WIP
author: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham
created: 21-03-2022

# Simple Summary

Acquire 200,000 BAL tokens via a combination of performing a BAL for AAVE token swap. The BAL tokens are to be complemented with ETH and deposited into the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year. The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools, [1].

# Abstract

Perform a token swap with Balancer by exchanging AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve for 200,000 BAL tokens. The exchange rate to be used is the 90-day moving average price when the votes pass on both sides. 

All 200,000 BAL tokens plus the aBAL tokens in the Reserve Factor (redeemed for BAL) are to be paired with sufficient ETH and deposited into the Balancer V2 BAL:ETH (80:20) pool. The veBAL holding will then participate in Balancer's revised tokenomics that commenced on the 28th March. 

Initially, the veBAL will be used to vote BAL rewards to pools which support aTokens that create TVL for Aave and/or AAVE liquidity pools.

# Motivation

Aave and Balance have a long history of working together. The AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drive TVL to Aave markets, [2].

When the AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool is moved to Balancer V2 and integrated into Aave’s Safety Module, the veBAL tokens can be used to vote BAL rewards to the newly created AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V2 pool.

In addition, the veBAL can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [3]. There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using veBAL to vote for BAL rewards to pools that strengthen Aave is a strategic advantage of deploying the BAL tokens into the BAL:ETH pool.

By exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. The token exchange, plus additional acquisition, is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder, based on etherscan BAL holder rankings, [4]. Balancer will become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [5]. Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate.

Aave will likely be one of the first movers in the upcoming BAL wars and will gain a strategic advantage to bootstrap new Balancer Boosted Pools which lead to tokens being deposited in Aave markets to earn yield. This has the benefit of creating TVL and Revenue for Aave.

The initial sizing to acquire 200,000 BAL was something that was reached via discussions with the Balancer community and happens to be the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer token swap, [6].

The initial sizing was also determined by the ability to influence how the BAL emissions are to be distributed. If all BPT from the BAL : ETH pool are converted to veBAL, Aave will receive 3.3% of the 14,500 BAL emission schedule which is equivalent to 478 BAL weekly, or $8,126/week at $17/BAL or $422,552/year. If 100% of the current BPT were deposited into the veBAL contract, the yield is very close to 10%. Other deployments from the Reserve Factor will also earn BAL rewards over time, [7].

With 3.3% of veBAL supply, Aave will determine where 2,680 of the 81,200 BAL tokens are to be distributed each week via the Ethereum mainnet pool gauge. This is equivalent to 5% APR on a $47.40M pool without any compounding or other yield sources like swap fees or yield from Aave markets. This is sufficient to support bootstrapping new liquidity pools that support growing TVL for the Aave community. Given the size of the Aave community investment in the Balancer community, it is reasonable to think that Liquidity Mining Committee may also be voting to allocate a portion of there 14,500 weekly BAL emission to support Balancer Boosted Pools which drive TVL to Aave markets.

# Implementation

The token swap is to be performed by both Balancer and Aave by depositing tokens into a contract like how Tribe DAO swapped TRIBE for INDEX, [8].

The aBAL holding in the Reserve Factor, 1,890 aBAL at the time of writing which will be redeemed for BAL and deployed along with the 200,000 BAL tokens attained via the proposed swap, [9].

Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor from there the BAL and matching amount of ETH will be deployed into the BAL : ETH pool on Balancer V2. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year.

The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools

362,"# **PROPOSAL SUMMARY**

The current locked staking pool for PancakeSwap's native token, CAKE, has been a widely unaddressed disaster to the ecosystem, pooling and exacerbating the eventual inflationary dumps of CAKE.

 The lack of flexibility and limited incentives have resulted in less stable token prices and decreased user engagement. To address this issue, we propose the retirement of the locked pool follwed by implementation of a new flexible pool that combines the various syrup pools and platform revenue share, providing users with an all in one inclusive staking opportunity and greater control over their investment. 

This change would incentivize long-term holding, reduce CAKE emissions whilst providing a higher APR and increase engagement and confidence on the platform, ultimately resulting in a more stable token price and increased overall value for PancakeSwap and its users.


As the recent tokenomics discussion propsal seemed to be split between both extemes of the community, we present this solution as a middleground alternative.


# **HOW DOES IT WORK?**
The new all-in-one pool for PancakeSwap will combine all available syrup pool rewards, a portion of the current CAKE emissions, and a percentage of the revenue earned on the platform into a single flexible staking pool. By pooling these resources, the new staking offer will allow more diverse and attractive APR returns to users, while reducing the overall emission of CAKE. 

The lost APR from the reduction in CAKE emissions will be substituted with other project tokens and stable coin earnings from the platform's revenue. This will not only return user confidence and incentivize users to hold their assets in the new pool for longer periods, but also promote the growth and development of other projects on the platform. Overall, the new all-in-one pool will offer greater flexibility and control for users, while also promoting the long-term sustainability and success of PancakeSwap.

Further, by substituting and combining multiple rewards sources into one, we can mitigate the effects of CAKE being dumped, instead users will seek to sell their syrup and stable rewards to buy more CAKE to continue staking.

We recommend that CAKE earnt should be auto-compounded, however the syrup rewards and stable coins must be claimed and do not attribute to users staked amount.

Allowing this flexible all in one model to take the place of our current model would be crucial to a sustainable and attractive staking mechanism on PancakeSwap. 


# **HOW WILL THIS EFFECT PRICE?**
The implementation of the new all-in-one pool for PancakeSwap will have a positive effect on the overall price of the CAKE token. 

By reducing the actual CAKE emissions and substituting them with other project tokens and stable coin earnings from the platform's revenue, the new pool will help move PancakeSwap towards a deflationary model, promoting scarcity and attractiveness to increase the value of the token over time. 

Additionally, the flexibility of the all-in-one pool, which allows users to easily move their staked assets between different opportunities such as IFO's and trading competitions, this will drive more investors to participate freely in the pool, resulting in increased demand for CAKE and ultimately leading to an increase in its price. 

Overall, the new pool will provide a more attractive and sustainable investment opportunity for users, while also promoting the long-term growth and success of PancakeSwap.

# **WHAT OTHER STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN?**
As part of a pro-active move towards an ultra-sound cake, we feel that the best way to achieve this whilst also remaining attractive to investors is to develop further utilities and burn mechanisms.

We also recommend that the allocated buyback and burn fund be increased whilst the price of CAKE is tanking, to increase its overall beneficial impact and effectiveness.",bearish

This proposal puts in place a Comms Team to establish communication channels in order to increase the flow of news, information and educational content within the ApeCoin ecosystem - working group name, ApeComms.

Recent Twitter posts and proposals regarding council elections, staking delays, bug bounties, etc have highlighted the need for clear, concise and consistent communications between the Special Council, Ape Foundation and the ApeCoin DAO.

The ApeComms team will administer information between the community, the Ape Foundation, and related entities and serve to increase Awareness, Participation, and Education of token holders by curating new channels for communication.

366,"Cake has been suffering towards a downward price action spiral which causes significant stress and pain to the community, the real cause for this is the inflationary state of $CAKE.

After the V3 launch the Farms APR and Emissions started to look more realistic in APR wise, the team is making a proposal to reduce emissions to Farms to improve towards achieve Ultrasound Cake (desinflationary state), still if this proposal succeed we will achieve a 2% extra of the goal reaching 71% status.

There is a big date event that would mean the 52 week locked $CAKE unlock in the coming weeks, this proposal goes toward creating a future framework before that users decide to Lock their tokens again.

The current emission model assign 191.557 CAKE daily towards Staking with an APR to Locked Staking of ~41.3% and a Flexible APR of ~1.93% and different APR for the different token partnership pools. 

More CAKE doesn't mean more money, it's the balance towards emission/burn which will guarantee our success.

This proposal goes toward cutting in half the emissions to Staking and redirect them straight to burn

The new emission example would be ~95.778,5 CAKE to Staking, ~95.778,5 CAKE to Burn. The APR example would be: Locked staking ~20.65% APR, Flexible APR ~0.965% 

The idea is to reach a consensus before the so called ""big unlock"" to happen to give transparency and freedom to users to take their desired actions.

If the proposal cause a better balance between emission/burn, improve price action and improve the mood of users towards Pancakeswap I would suggest to signal a proposal in 6/12 month to reduce emissions again improving our deflationary status and giving predictability to investors that believe in Pancakeswap for the long term.",neutral

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V2 ETH.

## Abstract

Many interest rate curves on Aave have not changed for a long time and, in the case of some assets, have never been updated for the lifetime of the asset listing. Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet has evaluated assets on Aave and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. 


## Motivation

Among other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve:

1. mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool
2. build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future

After some deliberation (not much might I add). I have decided to start accepting donations.

""What for?"" you might ask. 
My answer to that would be something in the lines of ""why not?"".

If you, unlike myself, feel that you have some money to spare, are feeling frivolous, and perticularly charitable. I am (for no good reason) asking you to throw some coin my way.

For no other reason than brightening a strangers day, being the proverbial wind at their back, tipping the scales of life in their favor. You know, just as a random act of kindness. Maybe get a warm fuzzy feeling in your heart and all that. 

If this does not appeal to you, I completely understand, and wish you all the best nontheless!

As outlined in the [updated whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the DOUGH capTier from `cap1` to `cap2` ($1M -> $3M).

# The Proposal
The total adjusted liquidity of DOUGH has reached almost $5M, well over the imposed cap of $1M. The cap should be raised in order to distribute a more equal share of BAL tokens to DOUGH pools via liquidity mining.

# What is DOUGH?
DOUGH is the governance token of PieDAO, a creator of tokenized ETFs which was among the earliest builders of Balancer smart pools. DOUGH is the building block of the DAO.

title: [ARFC] Deploy USDC and USDT GSM On Arbitrum
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
created: 2024-06-30

---

# Summary

This publication proposes deploying a USDC and USDT GHO Stability Module (GSM) on the Arbitrum network. The two GSMs are to be maintained by the GHO Stewards.

# Motivation

The GSM provides stability to the GHO peg by enabling assets to be exchanged within a defined price band. Deploying a GSM on the Arbitrum network enables swaps to be filled without unnecessarily creating an arbitrage opportunity between networks. 

With the LTIPP ARB grant coinciding with GHO being launched on Arbtirum, the Aave DAO can stimulate demand for GHO whilst also restricting the Bridge Facilitator mint cap to encourage users to mint GHO via the GSMs. User will also be able to swap USDC and USDT for GHO via aggregators that have integrated the GSM. This will lead to USDC and USDT being deposited into the GSM.

With a healthy balance of USDC and USDT in each respective GSM, the Bridge Facilitator cap can be raised more aggressively and a GHO Bucket Cap with Facilitor role can be introduced to Aave v3 on Arbitrum. 

# Specification


The below outline the proposed changes to be included in the governance proposal submission.

## Ethereum

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave Events & Sponsorship Grant 2024
Author: Aave Labs
Date: 2024-07-08
---
## Summary
Aave Labs is pleased to announce an event grant proposal. This proposal includes participation in key ecosystem initiatives at EthCC and Devcon among other events.

## Goals
To reinforce Aave Protocol’s unique and positive culture, share technical knowledge, and attract new community members. These initiatives are aimed at helping to continue the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem by showcasing Aave Protocol’s core values.

## Background
Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, contributors, and stakeholders.

Although the Aave Protocol has emerged as a leader within DeFi, the sector at large is still in its nascent stages, and Aave should work hard to retain its spot as a leader. For the events proposal from the DAO for 2024, Aave Labs wants to concentrate on proposing fewer but higher-quality events to maximize impact. 

## Overview
Aave Labs is requesting a grant for 650,000 GHO for events for the remainder of 2024 for EthCC Brussels (45%) and Devcon Bangkok (55%):
1. **Hackathons & Bounties:** We want to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, and to remain visible and competitive in a growing industry, but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem. We propose to sponsor one ETHGlobal hackathon in Q4 in Bangkok.
2. **Open Finance Day:** We are hosting Open Finance Day in partnership with key players in DeFi for high quality talks, networking, and light bites. Talks will include members of the DeFi community, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members and service providers. 
3. **Side Events:** Hosting side events alongside major conferences is an opportunity to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge, and industry insights. Typically featuring panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts, side events are designed to strengthen awareness of Aave and GHO technology among strategic audiences, reach new target audiences, and ensure Aave and GHO remain top-of-mind within and outside the community. 
4. **Merch:** Aave Labs seeks to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement and awareness-building efforts as well as to proliferate the new visual identity and the beloved Ronnie ghost. Aave Labs will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials and creation of merchandise people actually wear, use, and love.
5. **rAAVE:** To celebrate the Aave community’s welcoming culture, we aim to host two more editions of the flagship rAAVE event. Throughout the past years rAAVE has positioned itself to be the most sought after event in the ecosystem. They foster community spirit and create memorable experiences. We will integrate the GHO Pass for ticketing logistics and manage press relations and social media to maximize awareness and inclusion. This year’s events will be hosted at EthCC in Brussels and Devcon in Bangkok. To mitigate some costs for rAAVE, we are planning to potentially obtain co-sponsorship with current or potentially new partners for the Aave ecosystem. Due to the event’s high visibility, it is crucial that if co-sponsorship is obtained, the selected partners are aligned with the Aave Community and this is conducted in a balanced manner.

After covering the aforementioned main sponsorships, any remaining budget will be directed towards side events related to the security of DeFi and smart contract technology. Any excess funds from this grant will be rolled over to be used for events during Q1 2025. A recap on last year’s events was posted to governance last December, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-events-sponsorship-budget/14953/18).

Aave Labs shall cover all expenses for its team members, and this proposal does not request any funds for these expenses, or include any compensation for Aave Labs’ work.

## Next Steps
If Snapshot is successful, then move to AIP

 ## Conclusion
We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of 650,000 GHO for activations and events for the remainder of 2024 will not only help enrich the Aave Protocol ecosystem, but will foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition.

We look forward to the DAO’s support for this proposal for these events during 2024.",neutral

382,"Gauge Proposal Template:

**Summary:**
> This pool uses the new weighted pool factory which allows Balancer to apply the protocol fee to rETH's yield. This gauge would be introduced as a ""core pool"" under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. In addition, any RPL collected by the `ProtocolFeeCollector` would also be directed towards bribing on this pool. We currently have ~$60k RPL in the fee collector which Balancer can use to bootstrap initial TVL, thus kick starting the flywheel here. It is also likely that Rocket Pool will assist with some incentives on their side. This gauge is enterring without a cap.

**References/Useful links:**

> Link to:
    • [Website](https://rocketpool.net/)
    • [Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/)
    • [Github Page](https://docs.rocketpool.net/developers/usage/contracts/contracts.html#introduction)    
    • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool)

**Protocol Description:**

> rETH represents liquid staked ETH. RPL is the governance token for Rocket Pool. 

**Motivation:**

> Balancer's near term focus is increasing TVL of yield bearing assets like RPL. With the new weighted pool factory we have the opportunity to also stimulate more trading activity in these yield bearing tokens. Given Rocket Pool has begun heavily bribing for rETH pools and Balancer aims to support the expansion of rETH, it is natural that we should attempt to secure more trading of RPL. Currently we will only be competing with uni-v3 so I expect interest and uptake to be strong here.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Please see this [guide](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1) which outlines Rocket Pool's DAO structure. 

2. **Oracles:** This pool will rely on a rate provider which has been in use for the rETH/ETH pool for some time. You can see it [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a8F81c256aee9C640e14bB0453ce247ea0DFE6F). 

3. **Audits:** See [here](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-4-2635c44e4f7e).

4. **Centralization vectors:** Rocket Pool is a [protocol for decentralized and trustless ETH2 staking](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd).

5. **Market History:** See [coingecko page](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth).
 
6. **Value:** Balancer will soon be the top destination for rETH liquidity on Ethereum if we aren't already. In order to boost our protocol revenue from this liquidity we need to stimulate rETH trading activity. RPL being the governance token of rETH seems a natural first step for a non-correlated pairing. RPL has seen significant trading interest going into the merge and this would be the first incentivized RPL liquidity pool on Ethereum as far as I know.

BSCPAD-BNB LP was selected as part of the batch for multiplier reduction this week.
It was reduced from 1.0 to 0.1.It used to earn ~190% APY, now it is reduced to ~30%.

BSCPAD has great utility as the governance token for BSCPAD launchpad. There are predefined amounts that you can stake to acquire higher levels when participating in new token launches. The BSCPAD-BNB pool is a great place to keep your excess BSCPAD tokens that are momentarily not contributing to increasing your launchpad level.

Please consider increasing the multiplier either back to 1.0 or at least to 0.5 to help out users accumulating BSCPAD between their launchpad levels.

384,"#### Revised: PancakeSwap Welcomes CyberConnect ($CYBER) to Farms!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Farm with CyberConnect! 

CyberConnect is a Web3 social network that provides developers with the capability to create social applications. These applications allow users to own their digital identity, content, connections, and interactions.

In order to improve trading conditions and CAKE buyback, we are introducing CAKE emission to the current CyberConnect Liquidity Pool - CYBER-BNB on BNB Chain.

By introducing CAKE emission to CYBER-BNB on BNB Chain, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.


The farm multiplier of this revised proposal has been adjusted to ensure **CAKE is distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner for CAKE holders.**

#### The Farm:

Stake CYBER-BNB (0.25% fee tier) v3 LP to earn CAKE tokens!

- Farm duration: 30 days
- Farm base multiplier: **up to** 12x
- Liquidity pair: CYBER-BNB (0.25% fee tier) v3 pair
- Start time: Approx. 0900 UTC on 18 Aug 2023
- Finish time: Approx. 0900 UTC on 17 Sep 2023 


During the 30-day farm period, we request for flexibility in the farm multiplier - we will start with **8x** CAKE rewards and will adjust the multipliers as appropriate to enable optimal trading conditions, up to a **maximum** of 12x. 

At the end of the 30-day period, the farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $CYBER?

CYBER is the name of CyberConnect governance token. There are multiple utilities for CYBER token such as:
- Participate in the governance directly or by delegating their votes
- Used for payment when minting CyberConnect’s ERC-721 NFT handle (CyberID).
- Used as means of payment for gas fees for all transactions while interacting with CyberConnect’s smart contracts (CyberAccount)

## Summary:

This proposal aims to progress a 6-month relationship between Aave and Flipside Crypto, creating sustainable frameworks, resources, and operational support.

This proposal incorporates key feedback from existing service providers and the community, shifting the scope to focus on existing capabilities and operational efficiency.

## Motivation:

Flipside has been a long-standing steward of Aave, contributing to multiple initiatives. We have been a previous grant recipient, 2nd ever delegate, and strategic growth partner.

This proposal seeks to cement Flipside’s role and further invest in services and resources toward a more sustainable, more engaged, and clearer future.

In particular, the proposal addresses increased diversity in the delegate base, up-to-date documentation, framework development, data availability, and community resources.

This proposal is aimed to be a low-cost way of introducing and investing in these services while encouraging delivery and a short renewal.

## Specification:

To initiate the service contract, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with flipsidecrypto2.eth (0x1ef753934C40a72a60EaB12A68B6f8854439AA78) as the recipient.

In terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()`method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a 180-day stream of 125,000 USDC. If successful, Flipside will offer and perform the following services on a 6-month basis:

386,"#### ABSTRACT

TL;DR - 2 Years of branded advertising on all Bored Brewing Cans & Free Beer for $Ape Holders at collaborated community events.

We want to spread the word of ApeCoin by integrating $APE into the packaging of our beer. This will include creating an $APE coin beer, QR codes on all cans to share information about the DAO and $APE, expanded IP with other NFT collections to merge our common interests.

  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/13b8bf23b5aa8ca79aa54751fdc4796f4a11957f.png)

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

We see a tangible benefit from two parties:

1. We will be sponsoring partnered events and sharing the $APE coin brand across other relevant crypto/nft communities. The goal is to market the coin and share the background and goals of the DAO for the future.
2. We will be spreading knowledge about $APE coin to less crypto native people who enjoy drinking beer. We believe that $APE can become a currency for the digital revolution and we want to be a small part of spreading the name to people outside of the crypto community.


#### OVERALL COST

$175,000 USD in $APE towards ApeCoin educational landings through trackable QR Codes, 10,000 Beer for Frens, ApeCoin DAO Dark Lager (name tbd) in the hands of normies, and 1 Lucky winner of their own Web3 IP Branded Beer!

388,"# Summary

A proposal to increase stablecoin Interest Rate parameters across all Aave deployments.

## Motivation

Following the implementation of [AIP-375](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/375/) to increase stablecoin borrow rates across Aave V2 and V3 deployments, we continue to observe volatility in borrow rates across Aave deployments. As we [highlighted](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096/3) in the recent proposal, we recommend a more aggressive increase of the Slope1 parameter to stabilize borrows under the UOptimal point.

**Stablecoins Total Supply and Borrow:** The data from the charts reflects an overall increase in both the supply and borrowing of stablecoins on the Ethereum V3 platform. From November 25th to December 12th we observed the following increases in supply and borrow across USDC, USDT, and DAI:
 
![image](ipfs://Qma9SeLwfVs7v6gFVLdQsGR8pHWVkiK8xnNjncMLFmmKEe)
    
We’ve observed an overall $49M increase (20.8%) in supply across USDC, USDT and DAI on Ethereum V3, and a $104M increase (45.4%) in borrows.
This general uptrend suggests that the AIP's changes were well received, with higher utilization for the assets following the parameter updates.

![Frame 78018.png](ipfs://QmapwiVXKY9F8LAToEgAJMLTJUTD8qaHjM4jvHCtyCPfAF)
    

**Utilization Rate Analysis:** Our continuous monitoring of the utilization rates post AIP-375, setting Slope1 at 5%, shows sustained demand. When looking at the percentage of times in which utilization was above UOptimal, we can see that the AIP-375 increase didn’t stabilize the utilization at or below the UOptimal. This could also be due to changing market dynamics with the recent increase in crypto asset prices.

During two distinct 16-day intervals, we observed the following:

- **Pre-AIP-375 Period (11.09.23 - 11.25.23)**
- **Post-AIP-375 Period (11.25.23 - 12.12.23)**

**Percentage of Time of Utilization Above UOptimal:**

| Asset | Before AIP-375 | After AIP-375 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USDC | 69.53% | 77.34% |
| USDT | 63.02% | 33.09% |
| DAI | 48.70% | 63.24% |

 
![Frame 78019 (1).png](ipfs://QmeVmhQjvUfCyx8X1Dioriz5rmcMQNVP4xRr1bcGomF3Ye)
    
The data demonstrates strong borrowing activity persisting after the interest rate curve adjustments, supporting a move towards higher interest rates. This pattern reflects a consistent, resilient demand among the top stablecoins on Ethereum V3.

**Borrow Rate Analysis:** After executing the previous proposal, we continue to observe fluctuations in borrow rates, suggesting the previous increase did not achieve the anticipated stabilization. This situation suggests that further adjustments of the interest rate parameters are necessary to achieve more consistent and stable borrowing rates.

### Recommendation

**Adjust Slope1 of stablecoins to 6%**

The analysis indicates a necessity for further refinement of stablecoin interest rates, to achieve a more predictable and stable borrowing rate with an equilibrium utilization under the UOptimal point. 
Therefore, we propose increasing Slope1 to 6% for stablecoins across all Aave deployments, in this iteration. Following this increase, we will continue monitoring the usage and equilibrium rate and make additional recommendations as necessary.

# Proposal summary
## Uniswap V3 launch on Polygon zkEVM.

### Overview of proposal
We propose to authorize Uniswap Labs to deploy Uniswap’s protocol to the Polygon Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup known as “zkEVM” on behalf of the community.

We believe this is the right moment for Uniswap v3 to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons:

* Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility.
* An Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.
* A new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization, to address the required recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts.
* Polygon is aligned with Ethereum and its values.

### About Polygon Labs

Polygon Labs is the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. It is rapidly building a suite of protocols that will offer developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions:

- L2 solutions/Rollups (Polygon Hermez 2, Polygon Miden 2);
- Sidechains, stand-alone and enterprise chains (Polygon SDK 1);
- Hybrid solutions (Polygon PoS);
- Data availability solutions (Polygon Avail 2) and more.

The Polygon network is by far the most adopted scaling effort in the Ethereum ecosystem, with 3,000+ applications hosted, 1B+ transactions processed, 100M+ unique user addresses and ~$5B+ in assets secured.

### Motivation
There’s significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkEVM helps solidify Uniswap’s place as the number one DEX and a thought leader.

Importantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Additionally, given the community and user uptake Uniswap has seen on Polygon PoS, it’s only natural to make its deployment on Polygon zkEVM a priority.

## Partner Details
### Polygon Labs

This proposal is being made by Jack Melnick, DeFi BD Lead, an employee of Polygon Labs. Polygon Labs is a legal entity focused on the ecosystem growth and maintenance of the suite of Polygon Networks.

### Partner Legal

The legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as “Polygon Labs”.

### Delegate Sponsor

There is no delegate co-authoring or sponsoring this proposal. Instead, this is a proposal submitted by Jack Melnick of Polygon Labs to support the growth of Polygon as part of the overall Polygon community.

### Conflict of Interest Declaration

There are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Uniswap’s legal entities, including Uniswap Labs, UNI tokens, nor investments of Uniswap Labs Ventures.

## KPI & Success Criteria

### Target KPIs
There are generally 2 forms of projects:

1) Growth-driven projects: on-chain, trackable metrics preferred here.
 
![a7f2d31aea283aae96a2e18a8c30badeba702d6f.png](ipfs://bafkreic7vtw65gqmqgrs46pbhdh4n6bbvd6kusbj77jz3cfsuwq4inj2mm)
    
2) Strategic Initiatives: that targets a specific goal (e.g. Uniswap Foundation core initiatives). These are more completion based.

![cb3bb480aa0a9ae1b520f73a0e0c16654f8f9e33.png](ipfs://bafkreidivzmticu723vvql57p6suqwurkd3lekjmfsbspy3h72pjn4ul6u)
 
### What does success look like?

Success Criteria: A successful zkEVM deployment will, in an organic and sustained manner, grow Uniswap’s Total Addressable Market across TVL, unique interacting wallet, volumes, and integration with partner dApps. As demand for zk-blockchains and proximity to Ethereum rises, users and builders will increasingly look to zkEVM solutions to build and trade.

### What potential risks are there for this project’s success? How could they be mitigated?

Risk Profile: Deploying on zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer Two, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereum’s core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. 

The bridge has been disintermediated, and Uniswap can expect reputable Oracle providers to be available as data providers from Day One. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months, and has accumulated over 84,000 wallets, 75,000 ZK proofs, and 300,000 blocks. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens. 

Primary risks, as always, include still unforeseen vectors, which can be mitigated through close work with Polygon developer support (whenever needed) and gradual deployment of liquidity on the new chain.

### Protocol security
Please address the following questions if you’re proposing a cross-chain deployment:

**Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?** Yes

**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?** No trusted entity, multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes, only L1 and L2 security. Pure smart contract interactions only.

**Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity?** All based on L1 and L2. L2 security is based on the L1.

**Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?** There are two ways to use the bridge:
- Native supported messages: Allow only bridging of ERC-20 and ETH. Here there is nothing someone can do other than that.
- Custom Messages: Custom receiver logic on the other side of the bridge. When you send a message the message needs to be received by a smart contract, so you have to build the receiver smart contract, which is specific to the logic of that smart contract. Here the security is up to the person building the receiver smart contract. These custom messages do not take custody of any funds. All we guarantee is that the message will pass the bridge if implemented correctly. We are just the message carrier.

**What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?** Here we assume no possibility for fraud.

**Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?** There is an ongoing audit process by a third party. We will not go to Mainnet without the results from the audit and vulnerabilities remedied.",neutral

**Summary:**
This is Eigenpie's proposal to enable a gauge for the mstETH/wstETH pool on Ethereum.
mstETH is an Eigenpie Restaked token that users receive when restaking their stETH into Eigenpie. wstETH is a wrapped version of regular stETH.

**References/Useful links:**

> Link to:
    • Website: https://www.eigenlayer.magpiexyz.io/restake
    • Documentation: https://docs.eigenpiexyz.io/
    • Github Page: https://github.com/magpiexyz/eigenpie
• Communities: Twitter: https://twitter.com/Eigenpiexyz_io Discord: https://discord.com/invite/magpiexyz
    

**Protocol Description:**
mstETH is a Liquid Restaked token by Eigenpie. Eigenpie is an innovative SubDAO created by Magpie with $320M TVL, focusing on the restaking of ETH LSTs via EigenLayer. As a liquid restaking platform for Ethereum, Eigenpie’s core mechanism enables users to convert their Liquid Staked ETH tokens into Isolated Liquid Restaked ETH tokens. These are restaked versions of ETH LSTs, created by Eigenpie. This process allows users to earn passive income from Ethereum staking and EigenLayer revenue simultaneously without requiring a lockup period.

**Motivation:**
Eigenpie aims to enable a gauge for mstETH/wstETH, substantially increasing its liquidity while supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Currently, the protocol utilizes a multi-signature wallet. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token.   

2. **Oracles:** Rate providers have been used [wstETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768#code) and [mstETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcc701e2d472dfa2857bf9ae24c263daa39fd2c61#code).(Under final review)

4. **Centralization vectors:** Our smart contracts are upgradable contracts which are owned by a 3/6 multisig.

5. **Market History:** No volatility. The Balancer pool has recently been launched.
 
6. **Value:** The mstETH pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity for the token on Ethereum. It will stimulate healthy volume and trading activity, providing the following value to Balancer:

* **Primary Liquidity Source:** The pool establishes itself as a go-to destination for mstETH traders, offering deep liquidity and competitive pricing.
* **Consistent Fee Generation:** As the pool's Total Value Locked (TVL) scales, it will drive substantial trading volume, generating significant swap fees for the Balancer DAO.

395,"This proposal has two principles to empower Ultrasound CAKE.


1. Increase the MAX CAPS (proposed weight gauges) for the CAKE pool from 35% to 60%.


Pros - This will undoubtedly encourage more CAKE staking, consequently strengthening the entire community and reducing selling pressure.


2. Develop a new aggressive reduction plan (around 50%) of emissions to take place over the next 4 months.


Pros - It is crucial to signal greater scarcity of CAKE to the market. All holders stand to gain from this measure. And this could happen until the BTC halving to take advantage of the bull run - THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TIMING.


Cons - This two proposals may decrease CAKE reward in farms. However, perform an analysis. There are two types of suppliers:


1. The holder
2. Those who sell CAKE to increase their APR farm.


The holder will not be bothered by these measures as they will benefit from them. However, those who sell CAKE will have two alternatives. Either they will start to become holders, which is beneficial for the community, or they will lose some selling CAKE rewards. But okay, they can continue selling, as the selling pressure will decrease significantly, and soon they will realize that selling CAKE is a bad deal.


I have been with CAKE since day 1. I saw CAKE go from $0.29 to 13, then 22, and reaching 44. 


Today, the protocol built by the devs, who deserve ENORMOUS RESPECT AND CONGRATULATIONS FROM THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY for their work, is much better than when it reached above 40. So, we need to instill more confidence to holde CAKE and to reduce the constant ""every day selling"" from farm´s by those who are only interested in increasing APR. Even these individuals should benefit because with a higher CAKE price, the supplier's CAKE reward will be greater.


Devs... it´s all about CAKE!! Let's empower Ultrasound CAKE with more deflation.",bullish
396,"Checking back Pancakeswap from 2021 till now i noticed that people want higher APRs and they are willing to lock their cakes in order to earn passive income. That was the main reason this project skyrocketed then.

Since ultra sound cake project started locked cakes decreased a lot and many investors decided to leave no matter how huge achievent was this.

Recently i read that millions of cakes where moved to third party projects because pf the benefits and the rewards. 

Let's ask the community to decide what they need more:

1) More Rewards and Passive income with less deflation
2) MUCH More Rewards and Passive Income with balanced stable Total Supply. (Every week all aditional minted cakes which would be burned to create deflation will be gived to veCake shares as rewards
3) Nothing. Keep same deflation and same Rewards",neutral

**Title:** [ARFC] Stablecoin Harmonization and Asset Parameters Optimization 
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-01-03

---
## Simple Summary

This ARFC proposes focusing stablecoin collateral usage on USDT and USDC while setting LTV to zero for less-trafficked stablecoins and long-tail assets. The objective is to minimize risk for the protocol, optimize revenue generation, and align with market demand trends.

## Motivation

Aave's revenue primarily comes from wETH borrowing and stablecoins borrowing. Years of User behavior data in DeFi indicates a low demand for fluctuating assets as collateral except in use-case-specific scenarios (LST/LRT loops for Weth, RPL borrow to deploy mini pools). Based on @ChaosLabs  [data](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Ethereum/listed-assets/), only 2.4%, 3.7%, and 5.8% of supplied DAI, USDT, and USDC on Ethereum are being utilized as collateral. We can also note that market demand for alternative stablecoins is less sensitive to borrow rates compared to blue-chip stablecoins like USDT and USDC.


The DAO governance has been lenient in onboarding some collaterals, such as KNC, which currently attracts nearly zero traction (currently used to generate 0.79$ of borrow volume) and generates minimal revenue. Additionally, the asymmetric risk presented by stablecoins, such as during the CRV event (collateral was USDC with very high LT and low LB), highlights the need for optimization considering Risk/reward.

## Specification

### Proposed Adjustments:

The ACI proposes the following strategy shift:

1. Focus on USDT and USDC as primary stablecoin collaterals.
2. Set LTV to zero for alternative stablecoins and long tail assets.
3. Enable a 3%/week LT reduction for these stablecoins assets, providing ample time for users to react and keep them as passive yield sources or borrowable assets that represent 99% of current user demand and most of protocol revenue.
4. Propose the following adjusted standardized ReserveFactor categories for Aave assets:

| Collateral Type | Reserve Factor % |
| --- | --- |
| wETH | 15% |
| USDC/USDT | 10% |
| Alternative stablecoins & long tail assets | 20% |
| DAI | 25% |

5. Fade out as collateral the following stablecoins: 

- FRAX
- LUSD
- EURS
- agEUR
- JEUR
- MAI

6. freeze (if not already), then slowly offboard the following alternative stablecoins and long-tail assets that failed to gain traction by gradually increasing RF to 99.9%, decreasing LT by 3% per week then applying incremental interestRateStrategies incentivizing users to switch to others collaterals or borrowed asset as the DAO implemented for BUSD and TUSD on Aave V2:

| Collateral Type          | Network      |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| EURS                    | All pools     |
| agEUR                   | All pools     |
| JEUR                    | All pools     |
| MAI                      | All pools    |
| KNC                     | Ethereum     |
| STG                     | Ethereum     |
| BAL                     | All pools    |
| FXS                     | Ethereum     |
| UNI                     | Ethereum     |
| WBTC.e                  | Avalanche      |


## Next Steps

1. Community feedback and gather consensus on the proposed adjustments.
2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.
3. If successful, escalate to AIP stage.

# BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING! ⚠️⚠️⚠️💀

The official TLOS token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:
[**https://bscscan.com/token/0xb6c53431608e626ac81a9776ac3e999c5556717c**](https://bscscan.com/token/0xb6c53431608e626ac81a9776ac3e999c5556717c)

Any other TLOS token will be a scam and will result in a financial loss for users. Do not buy tokens from any other token address. Always verify the token address before purchasing tokens. If you receive airdrops from another address for TLOS tokens, they will be rotten tokens (but not the cool kind!), and we advise you to ignore them.",bearish
401,"##### ABSTRACT
The purpose of this proposal is to give voting rights back to the broader ApeCoinDAO community and its delegations for Working Group Steward positions.

The Ape Assembly was established as a Governance Working Group Initiative outlined in AIP-239, aiming to facilitate Working Group Steward elections. However, with as few as twenty active voters in recent weeks, there are growing concerns about the legitimacy that those elections would carry. Furthermore, we need Stewards who have experience in conducting significant outreach within the ApeCoin DAO community, which only DAO-wide campaigns can provide.

Currently, there will be four new Stewards elected in the upcoming Metaverse and Marketing and Communications Working Group elections scheduled to commence Nov 1, 2023, with approval to execute critical functions for the DAO moving forward.

To address these issues and enhance overall voting participation, this proposal recommends shifting future Working Group Steward elections from the Ape Assembly to a tried and true DAO-wide voting structure.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
This AIP benefits the ApeCoin ecosystem by ensuring that Working Groups meet their mandates of providing critical functions and services to the DAO, and continuing to provide a voice for the broader ApeCoin DAO community through their ability to vote, while maintaining consistency with all other elections.

This AIP adheres to the DAO’s values of Collective Responsibility and Boldness by taking decisive action to address this issue of representation in Working Group Steward elections, and working towards progress over perfection.

402,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal presents the idea that ApeCoin holders should be eligible for free-to-claim luxury products produced by the Forever Apes team. Through a mix of free-to-claim digital and physical products, we will create a unisocks type buzz and stimulate the $APE community, engagement and growth.

Each product drop will highlight a different NFT collection, community or crypto personality. The inaugural product will be 1000 decks of NFT themed luxury playing cards. Free-to-claim (+shipping) to anyone with a minimum of 100 $APE in their wallet. Using TokenProof’s token-gating technology we can set minimum $APE requirements and eventually, time it has spent in the wallet prior to claim.

We believe this will help grow the community, further $APE brand recognition IRL, and we are requesting a grant from the community to help us accomplish this goal in order to build our products out at scale.

403,"Balancer has a vision to be a platform for other projects to build on. In pursuit of this goal, the core contributors have implemented a sophisticated technical architecture, an easy-to-use SDK for integrations, and have created custom AMM pools to demonstrate the potential of the Balancer v2 framework.

Balancer would benefit from product and project management. I would like to help develop and refine the value proposition for developers & token projects. And help service provider organizations / Blabs collaboratively deliver results.

I propose a 3-month assignment to provide a research report to inform the platform strategy and develop a project management framework that I will actively manage with Balancer Labs & SP orgs.

**Strategy research report**

Balancer would benefit from having a detailed understanding of the needs and challenges of web3 developers and projects that could benefit from Balancer technology. A report will seek to answer the following questions:

* Market analysis
  * What types of projects/companies/DAOs are expected to be built using defi primitives?
  * Who are the target projects for Balancer? What products are they building for users?
* Customer needs
  * What are the unique needs of stablecoin issuers? AMM designers? Lending markets?
  * What will drive needs and what are the factors that could change expectations?
* Value proposition opportunities
  * In addition to an SDK, what other features could differentiate Balancer as a platform for defi developers?
  * What pricing models should be considered when partnering / co-launching products with other protocols?

*Note: The above list of questions is indicative and could be revised based on discussions with Balancer contributors.*

**Project management & reporting framework**

Contribution to the Balancer protocol has scaled into several service provider organizations and partner projects. Service provider organizations have highlighted the need for closer coordination and project management. As part of this assignment, I will take an active role in cross SP project management and define an operating framework that can guide Balancer projects. Activities include the following:

* Partner effectively with other service provider orgs to accelerate Balancer projects and product development to define the planning & execution process.
* Develop by week and by month project management and reporting framework.
* Review metrics and reporting reports and recommend improvements.

**Duration & Costs**

#### Proposal to Launch veCAKE Gauges System on Linea

As mentioned in our initial [**veCAKE proposal**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), we are launching veCAKE in phases, and are excited to share the next deployment - Linea!

#### Recap: Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

Here’s a quick recap of veCAKE’s utility:

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders can directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE Managers, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE emissions. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
#### Inclusion of Linea in the veCAKE Gauges System

With the inclusion of Linea, the current **Trading Allocation** emission of ~125 CAKE/day directed towards Linea Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions. 

As voted for previously, the Kitchen will retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs, such as USDC-ETH on Linea. This is to maintain the liquidity depth and volumes of these core pairs, which contribute significantly to CAKE buyback-and-burn.

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE will be launched shortly on Linea.",neutral
408,"#### ABSTRACT

Polygon Labs proposes that ApeCoin DAO launch and maintain its own zero-knowledge powered Layer-2 (“zk-L2”) with the Polygon Chain Development Kit (“CDK”) to accelerate the growth and development of the ApeCoin ecosystem.

This proposal includes (1) the launch of a dedicated ApeCoin zk-L2 chain (“ApeChain”) built and maintained by Gateway.fm, a premier rollup as a service (“RaaS”) provider that builds Web3 infrastructure and tooling products with advisory support from Polygon Labs and oversight of such building and maintenance to be conducted by the ApeCoin DAO Foundation and (2) ecosystem collaboration with Polygon Labs to help stimulate the growth of ApeCoin-integrated projects (experiences, entertainment, games and consumer applications) and ApeChain-related public goods (middleware, marketplaces, and necessary infrastructure).

As contemplated under “Gateway.fm as RaaS Provider and Architecture Considerations” below, ApeChain will be fully owned, governed and run under the patronage of the ApeCoin DAO community with 100% of all revenue, including sequencer fees or any potential Native Yield (defined below), accruing to the ApeCoin DAO and ApeCoin Validators (defined below). No AIP Idea is inherently linked to this AIP and all AIP Ideas–design architecture or otherwise–not explicitly covered within this AIP (e.g., a separate “ApeChain token” launch/airdrop or a development fund from the ApeCoin DAO treasury to help stimulate the growth of ApeCoin-integrated projects and ApeChain-related public goods) is not precluded from this ApeChain implementation but instead is left to the community (e.g., through subsequent AIPs by ApeCoin community members) even in cases where Polygon Labs does not believe it would be in the best interests of APE holders.

  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/2/2e6b946844041736a2fee1f03c4bd247f683c501_2_1248x786.png)

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

The ApeCoin community has been aware that ApeCoin “will need to migrate to its own chain in order to properly scale” since these very words were [tweeted by Yuga Labs](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1520612362986078208?s=20&t=-NhsBR93IH1LJp6ZYfcDdA) nearly 18 months ago. Indeed, Yuga Labs went on to “encourage the [ApeCoin] DAO to start thinking in this direction.” While ApeCoin DAO voted on [AIP-41](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-41-keep-apecoin-within-the-ethereum-ecosystem-process/5664/2) to keep ApeCoin within the Ethereum ecosystem, the question of an ApeCoin-specific chain is open and remains ripe for decision.

Here’s where this AIP comes in: to propose a dedicated ApeChain, using Polygon [CDK](https://polygon.technology/polygon-cdk), an open source toolset developers can use to launch their own zk-powered L2 on Ethereum with little friction and an emphasis on modularity, built and maintained by Gateway.fm with advisory support from Polygon Labs and oversight by the ApeCoin DAO Foundation.

As detailed below under “Platforms and Technologies,” ApeChain will provide ApeCoin DAO and its members potential sequencer fees and staking rewards for network validators while solving the scaling issue mentioned above. In other words, this chain will provide dedicated, ultra-premium and inexpensive blockspace for ApeCoin DAO-affiliated and/or -incubated experiences, entertainment, games and consumer applications that will ultimately bring not only more users into the ApeCoin ecosystem, but also additional activity and creation of all types of value (content, assets, data and the like).

Polygon CDK has seen great adoption already. Chains being developed using Polygon CDK and core contributors thereto include X1 (built by OKX), Immutable zkEVM, NEAR zkWASM, Gnosis Pay, Capx, Palm Network, Astar zkEVM, Canto and Celestia (for data availability), among others. This is because Polygon CDK offers the highest degree of flexibility in scaling Ethereum while also remaining maximally secure.

ApeCoin DAO's [stated mission](https://apecoin.com/about) is to “empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3.” Via $APE, ApeCoin DAO will build and support “a decentralized protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse.""

ApeChain will provide the ApeCoin DAO with an efficient and secure execution environment upon which ApeCoin DAO projects can be built to help realize this mission. As a result, by virtue of ApeCoin DAO gaining composability and interoperability with the entire modular suite of Polygon solutions (including Polygon PoS, which will [soon be upgraded to a zkEVM Validium](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-upgrading-polygon-pos-to-a-zkevm-validium/12187?utm_campaign=Polygon+2.0&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=73083564&utm_content=73083564&utm_source=hs_email), Polygon zkEVM, Polygon Miden and various customizable L2 permutations using the CDK, together “**Polygon Architecture**”), the ApeCoin ecosystem will be primed for tremendous growth.

With thousands of dApps and millions of daily transactions, the Polygon Architecture is by far the most robust and stable Ethereum L2 scaling solution. With ApeCoin already bridged onto Polygon PoS, it is already available to be used by all dApps across Polygon Architecture – including for gas and staking in relation to dApps built on the proposed ApeChain (see “Platforms and Technologies” below).

It is [well-documented](https://decrypt.co/117671/decrypts-2022-crypto-project-of-the-year-polygon) that mainstream adoption of blockchain technology and Web3 is underway, and the Polygon Architecture is helping to bring blockchain to “Internet-scale.” This is across verticals and use cases, including gaming (Square Enix), loyalty rewards (Starbucks), phygital goods and co-creation (Nike), digital avatars (Reddit), self-expression and identity (L’Oreal) and the most adopted Web3-native use cases (from defi, like Uniswap and Aave, to the open metaverse, like Sandbox and Decentraland). As such, the Polygon Architecture is the most well-suited ecosystem for ApeCoin DAO to launch “community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse” and Polygon Labs is the most well-suited entity to help ApeCoin DAO to stimulate the growth of ApeCoin-integrated projects and ApeChain-related public goods.

#### OVERALL COST

As laid out in the preceding sections of this AIP, we estimate that the costs for building, deploying and maintaining ApeChain for one year, will be a maximum of $200,000 USD. None of these expenses would be paid to Polygon Labs or any affiliate of Polygon Labs. Instead, they would be used to pay Gateway.fm and its infrastructure costs.

Once ApeChain is built, deployed and maintained, the DAO (as a self-governing entity) will decide for itself how it will fund and maintain ApeChain in subsequent years. Possibilities include negotiating with the Gateway.fm on a contract extension or fielding proposals from community members with sufficient expertise who are willing to contribute to ApeChain’s maintenance, for example.

Title: [ARFC] Updated Aave Grants Continuation Proposal 
Author: @0xmigi & Bill
Created: 2023-11-14

---

# Summary

An opportunity to continue Aave Grants DAO (AGD) for 6 months by preserving the current AGD treasury holdings and increasing AGD’s GHO allowance by $328,000.

This proposal will enable AGD to deliver and improve upon the top tier grants program the Aave ecosystem has had over the past 2+ years and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem. AGD will fund $500,000 in developer grants per quarter, drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption, and set the groundwork for the next chapter of the continued evolution of AGD.

Figures and calculations based on asset prices have been updated from the TEMP CHECK to reflect the current market conditions.

# Motivation

Throughout the previous proposal, AGD has:

Awarded 50 new grants and made 15 payments to grantees based on milestone completion.

Engaged builders and the community at five events, including four hackathons where AGD awarded a total of 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties and inspired 58 teams to hack with Aave and GHO.

Proliferated the ghost by hosting 1 rAAVE to strengthen Aave’s culture, bring the community together, and cultivate an ecosystem with the best contributors.

Exercised prudence with the treasury by decreasing the average grant size awarded by 52.8% and maintaining average reviewer compensation at ~22% of the monthly maximum budget.

This proposal outlines renewing AGD for the next 6 months by:

Increasing AGD’s GHO allowance by $328,000.

# Specification

*History*
 
![image](ipfs://bafkreia5rsf2qn7obbf2y5fs6uzqdbhz74wrvh32yys76jc5a7ks2guuay)
    
Since its inception in May 2021 to September 2023, AGD has awarded $4,852,753 across 249 grants.

From the last AGD proposal in January 2023 to now, AGD has awarded 50 grants and awarded 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties across four different hackathons.

*Note: All $ cost amounts are calculated at time of payment, pre/post token value fluctuations are not included unless otherwise specified. Pending payments are not included.

This is the fifth proposal for AGD:

- The initial proposal launched AGD in May 2021 with $1 million of total funding over two quarters.

- The second proposal was executed at the end of December 2021 and funded AGD for three months with $2 million of funding.

- The third proposal was executed at the end of May 2022 and funded AGD for six months with $3 million per quarter.

- The fourth proposal was executed at the end of January 2023 and funded AGD for six months with $1.625 million per quarter.

Increase TVL or other protocol metrics

Expand the capabilities of the platform and utility of Aave

Empower the community with accessible and novel insights

Engage new users and enhance retention of current users

Grow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity

AND

(2) Fostering a strong and inclusive culture around Aave. Aave’s culture leads to:

Attracting and retaining the best contributors, and

Encouraging the development of new and creative solutions to key areas in the Aave protocol and Aave DAO.

*Metrics*

Grants Provided:

May 2021 - September 2023: 249 grants worth $4,845,753

Jan 2023 - September 2023: 50 grants worth $885,020

*Since the Last Proposal*

The community has been kept up to date with AGD’s activity in @0xmigi’s monthly governance updates, the Halfway Update, and through AGD being added to Llama’s treasury dashboard 1. The AGD website houses a running list since inception of grants awarded, event and sponsorship spend and other information.

The GHO release was an exciting launch for the Aave community and was a prioritized focus throughout AGD’s last proposal. AGD began to spread awareness about GHO’s launch and encouraged early development with GHO across the four hackathons that were sponsored. AGD also funded multiple GHO related grants and supported development with the introduction of ‘Request for Grants’, inviting projects that help to stimulate GHO’s demand and increase its utility to apply for a grant.

*AGD Budget*

AGD has exercised prudence with the treasury, while continuing to fund high quality builders and drive growth and experimentation in the Aave ecosystem. The current AGD treasury, including token allowances and OP, is roughly $1,435,042. Please note: despite continuing to operate and distribute grants, the dollar value of the treasury has remained relatively flat since the TEMP CHECK due to the appreciation of AAVE and OP.

Part of the reduced spend is because of a reduction in the average size of grants awarded. The average grant size awarded so far in 2023 is 52.8% lower than the average grant size awarded during 2022, currently at $13,936.

![image](ipfs://bafkreihafvtfdgespbdluqm6uv5kj2fbitjoutolsqorktozffh4tshhta)

*Other Initiatives*

- Increasing Grantee Accountability. There has been an influx in grantees (e.g. recently Defi Simulator, Projection Finance, and Aave Alarm) posting directly on the forum to introduce themselves, explain their grant, and to keep the community updated as they progress. Most of these posts are the result of an initiative from AGD to better increase grantee accountability and engagement with the community.

- ‘Requests for Grants’ (RFGs). A pilot project has been introduced to better direct builders to apply for grants in certain high impact areas. Going forward, AGD will look to expand the list of RFGs to target high impact areas and community needs by better communicating with different contributors and encouraging anyone to make suggestions.

- AGD Operations and Best Practices. Over the last two years of operations, AGD’s values and best practices have been refined and adopted. It is a priority for AGD to clearly define and share these values and best practices with the community. Here is an overview of AGD’s current process:

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiefrkqq5lsl3na4sm7hhxnwaqozsxmhvt67edyvm6sdms3iz44pke)

*Grantee Highlights*

Since AGD’s last proposal to September 2023, 50 new grants have been awarded and 15 follow up milestone payments have been made. Of the 50 new grants awarded, 22 are complete, live or have reached notable milestones at the time of writing. Each grant has positively impacted different aspects of the Aave ecosystem.

 
![image](ipfs://bafybeic5lh6oay26aff4iuyetkhxlv6uxktk73qgcbhvbv6lhvzktvtjry)

Here are some recent highlights from grantees:

Dullahan

Designed and launched a hub for GHO to drive adoption. Dullahan produces passive income for stkAAVE holders and provides GHO borrowers with access to reduced interest rates and reached over 3,000 AAVE in deposits a few weeks after launch.

Sommelier Finance

Enables the creation of state-of-the-art DeFi strategies that leverage Aave V3 and GHO with the development and audit of a Aave V3 adaptor used by Sommelier strategies. As of July, their Aave V3 integration has allocated a net of $4M to Aave V3.

AAVE based CIAN Strategies & Automation Tools

Expands access to Aave V3 with open source vaults and advanced automation tooling, allowing strategists to generate strategies and users to easily access yield. As of August 2023, CIAN has generated $55M in TVL across Aave V2 and V3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, Ethereum Mainnet, Avalanche and Optimism via its leveraged staking strategies.

Other applications include: DeFi Simulator, Aave Alarm, Projection Finance and Karma HQ’s Delegate Dashboard.

IntoTheBlock Risk Radar for GHO 1

Helps the community understand GHO’s activity with 20 dedicated risk indicators including peg performance, collateral distribution and whale credit history.

Xenophon Labs

Performed an analysis on the Safety Module proposing an increase in the slashing percentage with the intent of saving the Aave protocol ~$2.1M per year

Butter

Facilitated an incentivized delegate initiative which kickstarted paying Aave delegates, encouraged participation in Aave governance from new community members and sparked TokenLogic to start their delegate platform.

Flexible aToken Voting ScopeLift

Unlocks the potential for new deposits by enabling protocols to allow users to retain voting power with tokens that are active in DeFi like Aave.

AwesomeQA

Streamlined the community support process with their Discord bot that automatically and quickly responds to user questions. In the past 3 months, the bot has answered over 55% of all questions, with 30% of those answers voted up by users indicating the response was very helpful.

*Operational Focuses for this Proposal*

The path to a decentralized and sustainable AGD is a long journey. Here are some initiatives planned for this proposal to continue working towards an effective and sustainable AGD:

Finish Establishing Legal Entity

Establishing a legal entity allows AGD to begin operating more independently and with more protection and certainty for contributors by providing a legal structure for members and the ability to operate with the traditional financial world. As it currently exists, AGD is not able to even sign a contract. Transitioning to an entity is a big step for AGD’s maturity by providing clarity and protection to contributors, along with increasing operational effectiveness.

AGD is currently finalizing the process of establishing a Cayman Foundation Company. The grants process will continue to operate as it does today and there will be no noticeable changes to AGD’s current processes or operations for the community.

Revamping Review Committee

AGD will update the processes and structure around the review committee. One idea AGD will explore is introducing a rotating committee of community experts to serve short (3-6 months) time frames as grant reviewers. This will further involve the community in AGD while bringing expertise from different community members.

AGD and Service Provider Alignment

With the increased number of Service Providers, there is a need to create better alignment between AGD and the work being done across the Aave DAO. Introducing simple activities like regular touch points would enable AGD to better (de)prioritize areas for grants based on feedback and insights from service providers. Where appropriate, AGD can also better work with service providers on helping to define the scope of related grants.

Measuring Impact

AGD aims to enhance the way it measures impact from grants by further developing internal resources and working with teams such as Spindl to better track the impact effectiveness of grants.

Starting with specific categories of grants like quests, AGD will better visualize activity driven by grants and gain insights into the effectiveness of different spend. Over time, AGD will extend similar tracking to other grant categories and impact metrics. This will enable the community to better track impact from grantees and empower AGD to make better review decisions.

*People*

AGD now has ten members.

Lead. Bill oversees the growth of the team, the distribution of grants, and making sure AGD meets the strategic needs of Aave DAO.

Review Committee. The Review Committee is made up of:

Corbin Page - Paymagic, ex-ConsenSys

Calvin Chu - Impossible Finance

Francis Gowen - Flipside Crypto

Lawrence Mosley - Omni Analytics

Kakashi - Symphony

Andrew Allen - Coinbase

David Truong - x23.ai, ex-Aave Companies Genesis team dev

Operations Lead. Neil has streamlined the application process, manages payments, KYC, and other administrative tasks.

Analyst. Migi is the main touch point with current and future grantees. He finds opportunities where AGD can support grantees and track the returns generated. Migi also provides monthly updates on the governance forum.

Compensation:

Lead: $9k/month

Review committee: $150/hr, capped at 10 hrs/week

Reviewer pay per month has averaged $1,273/month per reviewer since May 2021. We will look to modify this as part of the overall revamp of the review committee.
Analyst: $5k/month

Operations lead: $150/hr capped at 20 hrs/month

Designer and other roles: one-off based on specific design engagements

The roles and compensation will be reviewed and iterated on in line with the focuses outlined above.

*Proposed Budgets*

This proposal’s total budget will be split between a Grants Budget and an Operations Budget. In total across budgets the total ask for the next 6 months is:

$328,000 increase in AGD’s GHO allowance
This would make AGD’s treasury, including allowances: 72.2% in stables, 18.7% in AAVE, and 9% in OP

$292,000 that was previously allocated to ‘Digital Marketing’ spend has been reallocated to this budget.

Notably for the stablecoin portion of the treasury, AGD has started to explore further driving GHO adoption and grantee alignment by collaborating with @TokenLogic to swap AGD’s DAI allowance with GHO. AGD will look to continue to do this with other stablecoin holdings in the future based on similar style governance proposals.

*Grants Budget*

Carry Forward	Ask	Tokens for Ask
Developer Grants	$614,980	$300,000	Stables
$133,000	$0	OP
Grants Total Budgeted Cost	$747,980	$300,000	
The OP is based on the 100,000 OP allocated to AGD during the previous proposal.

AGD will introduce a new $20k max grant size for all grants and double down on kickstarting the growth of new teams building on top of Aave and GHO.

*Operations Budget*

Carry Forward	Ask	Tokens for Ask
Compensation	$20,150	$300,000	Stables
Maintenance: Tooling, subscriptions, gas reimbursements	$526	$20,000	Stables
Legal Buffer	$69,984	$0	
Operations Total Budgeted Cost	$90,660	$320,000	
Increasing the overall amount allocated to operations, especially compensation, is necessary for AGD to grow its resources and operate more independently.

412,"Summary:

Harmony is proposing to work with the Curve to deploy Curve on the Harmony blockchain. This will expand stablecoin swap to its community of users and provide incentives to bootstrap the launch of Curve to a new ecosystem.

Abstract:

Our proposal is to support Curve as it continues to expand in the coming multi-chain world. Harmony is an open and fast blockchain that is fully Ethereum compatible with 2-second transaction finality and near-zero fees.

Harmony invites the Curve community to support this launch. Harmony will provide $2 million in incentives in ONE tokens to bootstrap initial usage of Curve on Harmony. We also propose the Curve community to contribute CRV tokens to add incentives to the launch.

In addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support.

Harmony is a sharded proof-of-stake blockchain. It has processed more than 93 million transactions on mainnet 4 and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible. Our secure bridges offer cross-chain asset transfers with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.

Motivation:

Curve is ready to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Harmony ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Sushi on Harmony and other DeFi projects.

A unique feature of Harmony is our bridges to Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain which are bringing in stablecoins and pegged assets from both ecosystems, i.e. ethBUSD-bscBUSD. This creates an unique opportunity for Curve to support stablecoin swapping of assets from multiple chains.

Specification:

The Harmony and Curve will deploy the Curve contracts and gauge on Harmony. Harmony supports EVM and Ethereum tooling, leading to a seamless integration, much like other EVM chains and L2s. During Harmony’s DeFi Hackathon in Sep 2020, a community team already successfully ported Curve on testnet: GitHub - harmony-one/dapp-curve-contracts 3 and GitHub - harmony-one/dapp-curve-ui: Frontend for curve.fi on harmony.one 6).

After the market is functional, we will work with the Curve for cross-chain governance implementation on Curve on Harmony.

Metrics
over 18,010 delegators and 118 validators, staking 4.2 billion ONEs ($700m staked)
$84 million TVL on Sushi on Harmony, and $30 million combined on other DEXes
$91 million TVL on Harmony’s bridge to Ethereum and BSC
3,200 creators and $1.6 million sales on DaVinci NFT marketplace
100+ active apps; over 135,300 active wallets; over 120 million mainnet transactions

Months 1-3: 40%
Months 4-6: 30%
Months 7-9: 20%
Months 10-12: 10%

For:

Curve will be the first major stablecoin swap on Harmony and will add net new users from Harmony’s 350,000+ community members. After enabling DeFi primitives like AMMs, our community is eagerly awaiting a stablecoin swap on Harmony.

Against:

Curve will need to maintain an additional deployment on Harmony. Harmony will work with Curve to ensure a smooth deployment and work together to enable multi-chain governance in the future roadmap.",bullish

Add support for the KelpDAO rsETH market to Venus Protocol on Ethereum Mainnet

Rationale

rsETH is a Liquid Restaked Token (LRT) issued by Kelp DAO designed to offer liquidity to illiquid assets deposited into restaking platforms, such as EigenLayer. It aims to address the risks and challenges posed by the current offering of restaking

Kelp has more than 300k ETH worth of assets restaked by over 25k users.
DeFi integrations across Balancer, Uniswap, Curve, Pendle, and Maverick with $50Mn+ in liquidity
Presence on 9 L2s including Arbitrum, Optimism, Blast, Scroll, and Mode
LRTs are a great use case for Venus as it is one of the fastest-growing ecosystems.

With rsETH being one of the top LRTs, integrating it as a collateral asset will create new demand on Venus which will be beneficial for both protocols.

414,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust twelve (12) total risk parameters across eight (8) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

In addition, we propose to enable utilizing FEI as a collateral on Aave. The initial parameters for FEI will be an LTV of 50%, a Liquidation Threshold of 60%, and a Liquidation Bonus of 6.5%. Most of the stablecoins that can be used as collateral are more liquid, and our platform's analysis recommends initially capping the amount of collateral that can be liquidatable to the average daily trading volume. If user behavior and market conditions over the coming months continue to show safe conditions for increasing capital efficiency on FEI, we shall recommend ramping up the LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus incrementally.


## Specification

This past week did not see outsized changes in market conditions nor within the Aave protocol. There were slight volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets. Our platform recommends the following set of parameter changes that will decrease liquidation bonuses on several less-utilized assets.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAL Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |
| DPI Loan To Value     | 65%     | 70%     |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| DPI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |
| ENJ Loan To Value    | 60%     | 70%     |
| FEI Loan To Value    | 0%     | 50%     |
| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 0%     | 60%     |
| FEI Liquidation Bonus    | 0%     | 6.5%     |
| MANA Loan To Value    | 65%     | 70%     |
| MKR Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| UNI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |

# TL;DR

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). GNO adjusted liquidity has been consistently greater than $10m since December 2020.

# The Proposal

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M).

At the time of writing GNO has over $22M in total liquidity on Balancer Pools, and has thus surpassed its $10M cap.

Gnosis hopes to further strengthen synergies with Balancer in light of the upcoming launch of Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator. V2 channels orders to underlying on-chain AMMs for execution and hopes to be integrating Balancer as one of its first partners.

As Gnosis has contributed liquidity for multiple Balancer pools, Gnosis currently holds 52,146 BAL. Gnosis holds and continues to earn a significant amount of BAL tokens which it intends to transfer to GnosisDAO to hold as an investment, instead of selling in the open market.

[Balancer is currently the most liquid exchange for GNO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gnosis) and it would be good to keep incentivizing it to avoid the fragmentation of its liquidity. The GNO token migration to other exchanges could potentially reduce Balancer’s competitive advantage of having the lowest fee and slippage for GNO/ETH pairs.

# What is GNO?

GNO is the governance token of [GnosisDAO](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosisdao-a7102fcf9224), which launched Nov 23rd 2020 and has since seen significant growth in community engagement. It currently has a $164M market cap.

GnosisDAO owns several core Ethereum infrastructure components such as the Gnosis Safe which currently holds [more than 2% of the total ETH supply](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/ul0PgNtcq9MwezZThlHrgOMEIzpvEmkdwA9XoVqi). GnosisDAO will soon launch Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator that channels liquidity to on-chain AMMs such as Balancer.",neutral

## Problem

Uniswap's governance treasury will retain 43% of $UNI supply vested over 4 years, currently allocated 113 million in $UNI. Current value ~ ****$2.724 Billion USD. Max drawdown starting on May 3 2021, in 20 days $UNI lost 71% of it's value, a loss of ~ **$3.616 Billion USD.**
We need to manage this systemic risk and volatility for the long term success of the community treasury. 

## Solution

Partial divestment of Uniswap governance treasury by using UMA Synthetic KPI Options to create a win for the treasury, a win for the protocol and a win for the stakeholders. Long term goal would be to put together an actively managed portfolio for the treasury aka uniHOUSE.

# Background

## Yam.Finance

[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has been leading the charge on treasury management for DAOs via our project DAO House: [https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a](https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a)

We've realized that there are significant systemic risks for DAO's treasuries. During the bear market of 2017 multiple projects were forced to sell their treasury at historically low values, which ultimately caused many of them to disband and shutter. 

Treasury management is mission critical for DAOs, yet the challenges and complexities are formidable. Sushi realized this systemic issue and collaborated with [Yam.Finance](http://yam.Finance) to build a custom treasury management solution called sushiHOUSE: [https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106)

The most difficult part of a treasury management solution for a DAO as large as UNI, is the first part, the treasury protocol token divestment. I present a novel solution that will benefit the treasury, the long term success of the protocol and also all stakeholders. 

## UMA Synthetics

A quick primer on UMA: [https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works)

By using UMA's platform, we are able to use battle tested UMA financial contracts to create KPI options. Here are some examples of current KPI options that are already deployed and distributed.

[https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4)

[https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa](https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa)

# KPI Options

## How do KPI Options work?

KPI options can be created by using UMA's battle tested UMA financial contracts. 

1. Determine KPI metric for the synthetic. For example, KPI metric is Total Value Locked (TVL), currently ~$1.5b. KPI Metric could be many different things like volume, total fees generated over 30 days ect. 
2. Determine target for KPI, value and expiry date. For example, we want to target 2x TVL start, $3b and want the option to expire end of 2021.
3. Mint KPI option by depositing collateral to be used at settlement. For example, collateralize 1 $UNI token for 1 KPI option. 
4. For our example above:
    1. TVL option starts at a value of .5 $UNI because current TVL is $1.5b
    2. If TVL > $3b before the end of 2021, the TVL option can be settled for 1 $UNI after it expires at the end of 2021. 
    3. If TVL < $3b at expiry it will be worth a fraction of 1 $UNI. For example at expiry TVL is $2b, the value of the synth expires to 2/3 $UNI = .667 $UNI.
    4. Synth is unliquidatable and fully collateralized. 

## How do KPI Options divest UNI's community treasury?

From example above, KPI Option is created by:

1. Collateralizing 1 $UNI token 
2. KPI metric tracked is TVL, starting at $1.5b
3. Target is $3b TVL by the end of the year. If it reaches $3b TVL anytime before expiry  

UNI's community treasury is able to utilize its treasury full of UNI tokens to create these KPI options. 

1. KPI Options would be minted by treasury and sold for stable coins via a gnosis auction or by various other means. Implied value of the option is .5 UNI (current TVL is $1.5b with target of $3b). 
2. The sale would fund the treasury with stablecoins which could then be used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options by using Uniswap's AMM pools. 
3. At expiry all KPI options could be settled and stablecoins withdrawn from LP positions. 
4. Treasury now has stable coins = WIN!
5. UNI stake holders have incentives to increase TVL = WIN!
6. Stablecoins are the cornerstone of long term success for UNI protocol = WIN!

Win - Win - Win

# Additional Details

[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has extensive knowledge on building synthetics on UMA's platform via our development of [degenerative.finance](http://degenerative.finance), V2 of site to be launched soon. Combined with our experience in DAO treasury management, it allows us to have a unique perspective to create this proposal.

Managing Systemic Risk in Uniswap's Community Treasury using KPI Options",bearish
421,"Background
- Pancakeswap's DAO governance is considering altering Pancake Gold allocation rate. On December 1st, 2023, a newly approved function was implemented where 5% of swap volume fees are converted to $gCAKE. $gCAKE has the potential to increase swap transaction volume and reward holders, but will $CAKE face market cap reduction if a derivative token supply is increased, or will the increase in bridge volume contribute to greater value for users. 

Proposal
- Increase $gCAKE from 4% of swap fees to 8% swap fees to further incentive swap usage and reward the Pancakeswap community. Maintain $gCAKE biannual rewards distribution timeline to incentive swap prioritization and bolster market sentiment. Currently, for every $1M of swap fees generated, $50,000 will be allocated to the $gCAKE treasury. This proposal is suggesting to contribute $75,000 to $gCAKE for every $1M of swap fees, which will later be distributed to DEX users based on wallet activity. A majority vote of 51% or greater is required for the protocol to implement this new addition. 

What is $gCAKE and when is the first distribution?
- Pancakeswap DAO has voted to implement $gCAKE rewards for the first distribution which is live for users from December 1, 2023 to December 15, 2023. Each $CAKE holder is eligibility if their wallet is older than 7 days and they have made a txn with $CAKE. $gCAKE distribution rate will be based on wallet solvency levels and bridge volume. 

If you haven't already, check [HERE](https://gold-pancakeswap.org) if you are eligibility for the Phase 1 $gCAKE Rewards Distribution. 

Execution
- If this proposal receives a majority vote of 51% of greater, $gCAKE treasury allocation rate will be increase from 4% to 8% to further reward swap users and hopefully increase overall swap volume. 

If the new rewards allocation rate is accepted it will be implement in the 2024 Q2 distribution. 

Don't forget to check if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gCAKE distribution if you have been an active $CAKE trader and DEX user.

title: [ARFC] Polygon v3 Supply Cap Update 2023.05.21
shortDescription: Increase SupplyCap stMATIC on Polygon v3 from 30M units to 40M units.
author: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic
dated: 2023-05-21

---

# Summary

This publication proposes increasing the stMATIC Supply Cap on Polygon from 30.0M to 40M units.

# Abstract

This AIP implements risk parameter changes to stMATIC Polgyon v3.

The utilisation of the stMATIC reserve has reached 99.95% and this publication proposes increasing the SupplyCap by a further 33.33% to 40M units.

# Motivation

Over the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. These products are now active with otheres through audit and soon to be deployed. 

With conservative Supply Caps being implemented and filled within minutes, or hours, communities who have built products on Aave v3 are experiencing great frustration. After investing time, resources and incurring audit costs, these communities are unable to promote their products to prospective users prior the newly implemented Supply Caps being filled. Some communities have coordinated large distribution network agreements in anticipation of offering users yield derived from Aave v3.

For these integrations to be successful, the Supply Caps need to be increased such that a wide array of prospective users can enter into these automated strategies. Currently, the Supply Caps are filling so fast Aave DAO can not even proactively implement upgrades through governance to maintain spare deposit capacity. At the root of the issue are the small incremental Supply Cap increases, these are being filled within minutes, or hours (34 hours previous stMATIC increase). These small windows of time, where users can deposits LSTs into Aave Protocol, are not conducive to creating an environment that encourages teams to build on Aave. 

The previous stMATIC Supply Cap increase was 5M units and the cap was filled within 34 hours. Other cap increases have been filled in as little as 3 minutes ([wstETH on Arbitrum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-polygon-arbitrum-v3-supply-cap-update-19-05-2023/13133)). The growth in TVL and the resulting revenue is good for Aave DAO. However, the risk exposure must be considered and it is the authors opinion that Aave DAO should consider implementing a larger increase this time. The last two stMATIC Supply Cap increases have not led to meaningful stable coin debt which is the primary risk concern.

 ![Screenshot 2023-06-04 at 22.33.58.png](ipfs://bafkreieuzgowbpk765f6hzkipfzpnvuqpmr4xsovfgnruuklp6chaazeje)
  
Something the DAO should also consider is that teams are distributing assets on Aave v3 Polygon to promote users entering the yield maximising strategy. It has led to Aave v3's TVL overtaking v2 on Polygon and increased LST adoption. If Aave DAO seeks to encourage teams to continual distribute rewards on Aave v3, then creating a supportive environment through larger Supply Cap increases is something that should be considered.

This publications seeks to increase the Supply Cap of stMATIC by 33.3%, or 10M units. This is twice the previous increase and represents 72.5% of the supply on Polygon and 33.4% of the total supply on Ethereum. This represents a pivot from the more conservative approach to risk and it recognises that liquidators could migrate stMATIC, or wMATIC, to Ethereum and redeem it for MATIC before swapping to stable coins. This type of liquidation is not atomic, nor quick and it requires the liquidator to take on price exposure over the duration of the process. However, it is wMATIC to stable coin liquidity on Polygon that is the limiting factor as stMATIC to wMATIC swaps incur low price impact on Polygon.

The author welcomes input from risk providers and feedback from the community towards the potential to implement a larger Supply Cap increase that pushes towards the 75% maximum, acknowledging there are some stable coin debt positions. If the community prefers for a more conservative 5M unit increase, same as previous proposal, the author will not hesitate to implement this whilst the discussion is ongoing.

424,"#### Proposal for CAKE allocation to Position Managers

![](https://i.imgur.com/Zr9BtII.jpg)


Over the past few months, the Kitchen has launched various Position Manager vaults across our various deployments on BNB Chain, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base and zkSync Era. 

These Position Managers have performed well, driving ~$250M in trading volume, and increasing TVL by ~$6M. 

Importantly, these position managers have also enabled users to provide concentrated liquidity in a simplified manner.

With these benefits, the kitchen feels that the value proposition of the Position Manager is strong, and will continue to expand on new vaults and new chains for this Product.

#### CAKE Allocation Details 

CAKE incentives for previous Position Manager vaults have been implemented individually through PancakeSwap’s governance process. 

In order to streamline the onboarding process for Position Managers on PancakeSwap, the Kitchen is requesting the allocation of **20,000 CAKE**. 

The tokens will be allocated among various Position Manager vaults over the next few weeks. 

This distribution will be carried out in a way that will maximize the TVL, Volume, and ultimately the CAKE Burn generated from incentivized vaults.

The Kitchen will share regular updates on the performance of these Position Manager’s vaults on our brand spanking new [** forum**](https://forum.pancakeswap.finance/). 

The CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from Position Manager vaults will encourage more users to deposit assets, increasing LP liquidity, and ultimately leading to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

#### Performance of Position Manager

Since the launch of Position Manager on PancakeSwap on 30 October 2023, various Position Manager’s vaults have locked up approximately **$6M in TVL**, generating about **$250M in trading volume** on BNB Chain, Ethereum,  Arbitrum, Base and zkSync Era. This trading volume will lead to significant CAKE burn, benefiting CAKE holders.

Title: [ARFC] Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum
Date: 2024-05-13
Author: Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)
---

## Summary

The proposal aims to onboard Threshold Network’s tBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum. tBTC is backed one-to-one with Bitcoin.

## Motivation/Background:

tBTC is Threshold’s decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum’s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.

Having recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).

tBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.

Threshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.

### Benefits for Aave:

- Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.
- A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.
- Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.
- Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.
- Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium’s LTIPP.

### Emission schedule

tBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.

### Risks

For tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - [Wallet Generation  Threshold Docs](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation)

The Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:

**TL;DR**
We propose utilizing idle treasury-owned BAL to engage in covered call lending using [MYSO Finance](https://www.myso.finance/): this would allow Balancer to generate significant stablecoin revenue, diversify part of its treasury and earn cash upfront without having to wait until loan expiry. In contrast to simply selling tokens, there's no immediate market impact. All loan execution happens through MYSO smart contracts and is trustless and fully transparent with full on-chain traceability.

**Proposal author - MYSO Finance**
MYSO is a decentralized peer-to-peer lending protocol that specializes in custom loans that allow users to borrow and lend with any ERC20 token. In addition, the protocol can support a wide range of different on-chain structured product strategies like synthetic token buybacks and covered calls. MYSO has recently facilitated several on-chain covered call strategies for treasuries/users, including one with [Telos treasury](https://medium.com/mysofinance/myso-x-telos-treasury-covered-call-strategy-launch-59f3a993dca7) and [Evmos community treasury](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/14699-generate-usdc-revenue-by-lending-part-of-evmos-treasury-through-covered-calls).

The protocol currently holds a [TVL of ~$2.2m](https://defillama.com/protocol/myso/) and is currently live on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Mantle, Evmos, Telos, Linea and Neon EVM. The protocol originated from the ETH Global Hackathon in 2021, where it was awarded as one of the [winners](https://ethglobal.medium.com/the-2021-year-in-review-e037a1e34c91). It is also [backed by several reputable crypto OGs](https://medium.com/mysofinance/myso-closes-2-4m-seed-round-2f4f8114144e), such as HashKey, Wintermute, and Nexo.

**Abstract**
Balancer has frequently engaged in treasury diversification efforts as well as deployment of BAL to various on-chain yield-generating strategies. The Balancer DAO still has a large sum of BAL tokens idle in the treasury and recent posts within the governance forums have mentioned the need to continue to actively deploy these funds to diversify/earn yield. 

To support this endeavor, we propose using BAL to engage in covered call lending, allowing the treasury to generate USDC income. In contrast to conventional lending, the USDC is earned upfront, eliminating the need to wait until the loan matures. All loan execution happens through MYSO smart contracts and is trustless and fully transparent with full on-chain traceability. 

The covered call lending parameters, such as loan duration and upside cap, can be customized according to individual treasury preferences to optimally serve the Balancer community. Unlike traditional CeFi-style covered calls which are oftentimes presented by market makers, this proposal allows Balancer to get access to a similar financial payoff but without any counterparty risk. This is because the borrower is required to post USDC collateral upfront, ensuring that Balancer never faces a situation where the upside cap price is not paid or the loaned BAL tokens are not returned. The upfront USDC income from lending BAL can be immediately utilized for community needs. And unlike a simple token sale, covered call lending enables the treasury to diversify its holdings into stable assets without any immediate market impact. 

**Proposal Features**
**Utilize Idle Tokens**: Idle BAL tokens can be used to generate upfront USDC revenue
**Full Customizability**: Covered call parameters (e.g., duration, upside cap, size etc.) can all be fully customized to optimally cater for Balancer's treasury preferences
**No Market Impact**: Tokens don't need to be sold, thus there's no immediate market impact
**Covered Call Yield**: Yield is generated through a covered call structure, where cash is paid upfront for lending BAL and implicitly [writing a call option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_option) on the loaned tokens
**Transparency**: Loan execution happens transparently on-chain using 3x audited MYSO smart contracts, without counterparty default risk

**Benefits**
* Immediate revenue and liquidity for operational and developmental activities
* Diversification of the treasury into stables (e.g., multiple covered calls can be executed consecutively over a longer time period) 
* Unlike conventional covered calls or market maker loan arrangements, there is no counterparty risk


**Example Scenario**
Balancer treasury lends $250k worth of BAL for 60 days at a 110% upside cap (strike). In return, the Balancer treasury gets ~$18.75k USDC upfront (~46% APY). Then, at expiry, there are two possible outcomes:
 
- If the BAL price remains below 110% after 60 days, the originally loaned BAL is returned. 
- If it exceeds 110%, Balancer treasury receives $275k USDC and also retains the upfront USDC.

The diagram below shows indicative upfront premiums that the Balancer treasury could earn across various loan duration (Days to Expiry) and upside cap (Relative Strike Level) combinations. Generally, the longer the loan duration and the lower the upside cap the higher the upfront premium Balancer can earn. Balancer can customize the covered call terms to their liking and choose from a number of different duration/upside cap combinations. Additional indicative prices can be provided upon request.

The premium for the example scenario above (110% upside cap, 60 day duration) is indicated in red (7.49% upfront)

 
![myso1.png](ipfs://bafkreigfbi3raqtjb2rro2rwneuisz5gtqubxghnf3zdecdhnnej2jfq5i)
    

**How does a Covered Call work?**
Below is a diagram illustrating the payoff of a covered call for BAL tokens and how it compares to simply holding. A simple holding strategy results in a linear payoff (green line).

For instance, if BAL increases by +10%, the gain is +10%, and if it decreases by -10%, the loss is -10%. On the other side, the covered call payoff line (blue line) also follows a linear shape but only up to the upside cap, beyond which the gain is capped.
 
![myso2.png](ipfs://bafkreiefihge6ssbc4hwjxfjpwu6taxyvi2ylh5glxtfviv4fa4rpv3pya)
    

Note how the covered call payoff line is shifted upwards by the USDC upfront premium received for lending BAL, regardless of how the price of BAL moves. This means that in all cases where the BAL price remains below the upside cap, the outcome of the covered call will always be better. Only when the price exceeds the upside cap would holding lead to a better outcome. From an overall risk perspective, this implies that the downside risk with a covered call is lower than holding BAL.

For example, even in the unlikely case where BAL were to drop by -100%, the covered call would have returned a better result because the upfront USDC cash would have been received in any case. Hence, the downside risk of doing a covered call is actually lower than simply holding BAL.

**Where Does the Yield Come From?** 
When Balancer lends through a covered call, it essentially lends treasury tokens and writes a call option. The borrower, on the other hand, buys the call option and has the right - but not the obligation - to return BAL tokens. To initiate the loan, the borrower first needs to send USDC to (1) pay for the upfront premium to the Balancer treasury and (2) provide collateral for cases where the borrower doesn't repay. 

For example, if Balancer lends $250k worth of BAL for a 7.49% premium for 60 days with a 110% upside cap, the borrower needs to send ~$18.75k USDC for the upfront premium and $275k USDC as collateral, totaling ~$293.75k USDC. 

At the loan's inception, the Balancer treasury would receive $18.75k USDC immediately and keep it no matter what, and at expiry, two scenarios can happen:
 
(i) BAL price doesn't increase by more than 10% after 60 days, in which case it's rational for the borrower to return the borrowed BAL tokens and retrieve the $275k USDC collateral

(ii) If the BAL price increases by more than 10% after 60 days, it's rational for the borrower not to return BAL tokens, resulting in an unlock of the pledged $275k USDC, which becomes claimable by the Balancer treasury. 

It's uncertain whether or not the BAL price will exceed the upside cap. One can use option pricing theory to determine a fair value for the embedded upside potential using the [Black-Scholes model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model). 
The USDC upfront premium that Balancer would receive (in this example $18.75k) compensates for selling this embedded upside potential or call.

**How can the Balancer treasury lend BAL via Covered Call?**
Apart from programmatic execution, the Balancer treasury can use the MYSO DApp [https://app.myso.finance/] to carry out a covered call transaction. The first step is to create a “lender vault” (see screenshot)

](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1874a08F7975b25944FEb989BbAaA464f61aB3bc#writeContract)

 
![myso3.png](ipfs://bafkreid7t5ykmw57spmxyc554zx2bqrafpgyqlfj4av4iscsu4nuwemqoa)
    

Once a lender vault has been created, the treasury can then fund the vault by adding BAL tokens as assets to lend. Once the vault has been funded, one can then create a covered call loan offer according to the target terms.

On the ‘Create Covered Call’ page, you can add your desired upside cap, loan tenor, and upfront premium.

Once the loan offer has been created, it will become visible on the borrow page. Through MYSO’s OTC network, loan terms can be discussed and matched with institutional borrowers beforehand, so that when the offer is created, the Balancer treasury can be certain that the borrower will take the loan offer within a few hours. In case the borrower doesn't execute the loan for any reason, Balancer can withdraw the funds at any time. Additionally, the loan offer can be created with a deadline, meaning that it automatically invalidates after a certain time. Lastly, the loan offer can also be parameterized to be executed only by a certain counterparty if desired.

**How secure is it to do covered calls?** 
MYSO has undergone three independent rigorous audits with leading security experts from Statemind, Omniscia, and Trail of Bits. All audit reports are publicly available and can be seen here:
 
Statemind: [https://github.com/statemindio/public-audits/blob/main/Myso%20Finance/2023-08-15_Myso_v2.pdf] 
Omniscia: [https://omniscia.io/reports/myso-finance-lending-protocol-644911cef1412d00142bf698/] 
Trail of Bits: [https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-04-mysoloans-securityreview.pdf] 

Moreover, as mentioned earlier in the proposal, one of the benefits of using MYSO for covered calls is the absence of counterparty risk. MYSO provides access to covered calls in a trustless manner, eliminating the need to trust the borrower.

**Technical Specifications**
The Balancer LM multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the MYSO Vault Factory token contract at `0x1874a08F7975b25944FEb989BbAaA464f61aB3bc` and `call createVault(bytes32 salt)` passing in `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` as the salt. 
This will create a vault clone with address `0xdC84A5e6Bf288af75CC821226634644Ed6a7aB54`. 

Then, the aforementioned Balancer multisig will call transfer on BAL Token at contract address `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` with to address being newly created vault address `(0xdC84A5e6Bf288af75CC821226634644Ed6a7aB54`) and amount being `25000_000000000000000000` ($94,000 USD at current spot price of ~$3.76)

The last interaction would be to create the actual quote - here would be the example transaction for a quote at 120% strike, 5% upfront premium for 30d tenor:
Balancer LM multisig (`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`) would call `addOnChainQuote` function on `quoteHandler` at address `0x71E1cc2F7574C798ED893Ef04D55D1E573bE95B1` with params

**Specification**
The above parameters are an estimate/example transaction since the upfront fee/premium could change depending on the recent BAL volatility following the proposal being approved.

We propose utilizing 25,000 BAL tokens as the notional amount (~$94,000 USD at current spot price of ~$3.76) and utilizing either a 110% or 120% upside cap (strike). 
We propose running the strategy at either a 30 or 60 day tenor and repeat the strategy over the course of 6 months to start - the tenor for each transaction would depend on the upfront premium, and we’d push towards securing a tenor for which the premium would result in highest annualized yield. 

We also propose to never quote below a 2.5% premium on 120% strike (~30.4% APY) and below 4.0% premium on 110% strike (~48.7% APY) for a 30 day tenor strategy. 
In addition, we propose never to never quote below 4.0% premium on 120% strike (~24.3% APY) and below 5.5% premium on 110% strike (~33.5% APY) for a 60 day tenor strategy.

Once the proposal is approved and the Balancer LM multisig seeds their bespoke vault with the 25,000 BAL, no other active management will be needed apart from settling on a quote and creating new offers after each strategy expiry. 


**Conclusion** 
This proposal has outlined how Balancer can generate USDC cash revenues by using idle BAL treasury for covered call lending. This approach not only diversifies the treasury but also avoids market impacts that could arise from outright selling BAL. The flexibility in structuring loan terms allows Balancer to tailor the initiative according to its unique risk-reward preferences, ensuring alignment with its broader financial and operational objectives. 

We look forward to hearing your comments and feedback and would love to assist in pushing this proposal to voting!",neutral

## Summary

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient.
The protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. 

agEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there.

At the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero.

There are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/polygon/pools/0x3fa147d6309abeb5c1316f7d8a7d8bd023e0cd80) and on [Curve](https://polygon.curve.fi/factory/209). 
Besides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.

Stablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism.

The stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).
The protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.

## Audits

We have had four different audits which can be found [here](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits)

## Benefits for Aave V3

agEUR is already supported in efficiency mode with other stablecoins which should technically allow people to take leverage on Forex, or to arb more easily stablecoins at peg.

One thing that is not supported at the moment is borrowing against agEUR as a collateral. This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the € and short the $ through agEUR.

Right now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the €. This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future.

Relative to the size of agEUR on Aave, there’s also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment.

Doing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.



## Risk Parameters

With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters.

V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon

## Specifications 

**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**  
As mentioned in the disclaimer, I am a Core Contributor of the Angle Protocol.

**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**  
See agEUR summary section

**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**  
See Benefits for Aave section.

**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?).**  

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, it is ruled by the ANGLE token and more generally by the veANGLE token. Like many other projects, Angle DAO has indeed adopted the ve tokenomics. 

The platform was released [on November 3rd 2021.](https://blog.angle.money/angle-is-live-on-the-ethereum-mainnet-a8253162daf0).
ANGLE locking went live [in January](https://blog.angle.money/veangle-is-live-on-mainnet-4d702fcf7584). Votes by veANGLE holders are implemented by a 4/6 multisig composed of 3 core team members (including myself), [Julien Bouteloup](https://twitter.com/bneiluj), [0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xMaki) and [SebVentures](https://twitter.com/SebVentures).

**5. How is the asset currently used?**  

The asset is a € stablecoin. It is used by people as a means of exchange to pay in Euros in DeFi, or to keep a stable asset value in reserves before aping in elsewhere.

It is also used as a way to get yield in many places in DeFi

**6. Emission schedule**  

Token can only be issued following the rules of the protocol on mainnet: at oracle value if someone has provided either USDC, DAI, FEI, FRAX, or wETH. agEUR can also be borrowed from Angle Borrowing module at a 0.5% rate. 
There’s no emission schedule for the token.

**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**  

agEUR token contract on mainnet is upgradeable and can be upgraded by the [multisig ](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xdC4e6DFe07EFCa50a197DF15D9200883eF4Eb1c8/balances) described above.
agEUR on Polygon can also be upgraded by a [multisig on Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xdA2D2f638D6fcbE306236583845e5822554c02EA).

435,"## Summary

A proposal to make parameter changes on the Polygon Aave v3 market. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-cap-recommendations-for-polygon-v3-2023-11-03/15327).


## Motivation

Per Gauntlet’s supply and borrow cap methodology, we recommend setting supply and borrow caps for agEUR and jEUR. Currently agEUR borrowing is disabled as borrowing and cannot be used as collateral. jEUR is frozen. Despite this, all assets should have supply and borrow caps.




## Specification

| Chain | Asset | Cap | Current | Recommended |
|-------|-------|-----|---------|-------------|
| Polygon | agEUR | Supply | - | 300k |
| Polygon | agEUR | Borrow | - | 250k |
| Polygon | jEUR | Supply | - | 120k |
| Polygon | jEUR | Borrow | - | 100k |


**Disclaimer: Gauntlet reserves the right to not move forward with any parameter changes recommended in Snapshot polls, if market conditions change meaningfully.**
