72," This text provides an overview of the security considerations, risks, and proposed risk parameters for a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform called StakeWise. The platform is designed to allow users to stake their ETH and earn rETH2 in return.

   *Counterparty risks* are mitigated by using an Oracle network to accurately report daily staking rewards. Currently, there are 5 oracles live on the network, with plans to increase this number to 10 over the coming months. The protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO, which has additional security features in place to prevent malicious transactions.

   *Staking risks* such as slashing events and downtime penalties are mitigated through vetting of prospective node operators, providing them with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, and working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance (expected by early May). The StakeWise DAO also controls the exit signatures for its operators, making it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage.

   *Smart contract risks* are mitigated through audits by 3 separate auditors and a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI. The protocol's code is open-source and available on GitHub.

   The proposed risk parameters for sETH2 include an LTV of 70%, a liquidation threshold of 75%, a liquidation bonus of 7.5%, and a reserve factor of 10%. These parameters are presented in comparison to those of ETH and are similar to the current risk parameters of stETH. The interest rate model for sETH2 includes a UOptimal of 50%, a base of 0%, slope 1 of 8%, and slope 2 of 200%.

   In summary, StakeWise is a DeFi platform that allows users to stake their ETH and earn rETH2. The platform uses an Oracle network for counterparty risk mitigation, has additional security features in place to prevent malicious transactions, and has proposed risk parameters that are similar to those of ETH and stETH. The interest rate model for sETH2 includes a UOptimal of 50%, a base of 0%, slope 1 of 8%, and slope 2 of 200%.",,bearish

242," The case study presented here compares the performance of the Balancer Automated Market Maker (BAL) pool on Multichain and hypothetically on Across, a cross-chain liquidity protocol.

In the Multichain BAL pool, there were 34 transfers over a period of 53 days, with 14 withdrawals. The sizes of the 6 largest withdrawals ranged from 12,323 to 1,339 BAL, and the other 8 were less than 1,000 BAL. The pool is now effectively shut down due to low liquidity (only 484 BAL available).

If Balancer were using Across, all 14 withdrawals would have been completed without issue, and the relayer would have been rebalanced within 2-4 hours, ready for more transfers. For 12 of the 14 transfers, users would have received their BAL on Ethereum in 1-4 minutes. For the two largest transfers, it would have taken 2-4 hours. Over the 53 days, the Across LP would have been replenished approximately 7 times, allowing for significantly higher volumes of transactions compared to Multichain.

The Balancer treasury currently holds 80k BAL in Multichain. If they switched to Across, the treasury could take back 40,000 tokens, support over five times the volume at a fraction of the cost, and maintain operational status. The fees on Across are approximately 0.12%, compared to a 12% fee (100x more) on Multichain for moving 100 BAL from Ethereum to Multichain. If Balancer treasury wanted Across to have a fee of 0.10% or lower, they could specify a lower LP fee.

Across has three fees: the LP Fee (configurable via a rate model), the Relayer Fee, and the Destination Gas Fee. The total Across fee mentioned earlier is approximately 0.12%, which is the sum of the LP Fee and the Relayer Fee. This number will be higher when going to Ethereum due to gas costs that scale up quickly as a percentage of the transfer amount for smaller transfers.",,bearish

The current governance structure involves voting via Snapshot for treasury and token-related decisions, executed through a 2/4 multisig. The game and its related infrastructure are expected to become increasingly on-chain as development progresses.

The Luchadores do not rely on external oracles, and the LUCHA token is an ERC-20 standard token. Centralization vectors include the multisig mentioned above, which is necessary due to the game's current stage and the need for more guardrails until fight-to-earn is launched.

The Balancer pool ([https://polygon.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x924ec7ed38080e40396c46f6206a6d77d0b9f72d00020000000000000000072a](https://polygon.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x924ec7ed38080e40396c46f6206a6d77d0b9f72d00020000000000000000072a)) is the primary source of liquidity for the LUCHA token and expected to scale up significantly as veLUCHA staking and locking are introduced.

2. **Sale of KPI Options**: The options are sold for stablecoins through a Gnosis auction or other means, funding the treasury.

3. **Secondary Market**: The stablecoins obtained are used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options using Uniswap's AMM pools.

4. **Settlement at Expiry**: At expiry, all KPI options are settled and stablecoins are withdrawn from LP positions.

5. **Treasury Benefit**: The treasury now has stablecoins, effectively winning.

6. **Incentives for UNI Stakeholders**: UNI stakeholders have incentives to increase TVL, also winning.

7. **Role of Stablecoins**: Stablecoins are crucial for the long-term success of the UNI protocol, as they provide a stable foundation for transactions and investments.

409," Title: GHO Development Strategy and Budget Allocation

Summary: This document outlines the strategic focus areas for the development of GHO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) token, over the next three months. The key objectives include maintaining a 1.00:1.00 peg with USD, reducing price volatility, increasing liquidity for DeFi integrations, growing non-stable coin paired liquidity pools, and targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases. A high-level budget of 500k GHO has been proposed, with the primary focus on peg resilience (360k GHO) and creating utility (140k GHO). Performance indicators such as TVL DEX Liquidity Pools, TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools, DEX Liquidity Composition, Swap Price Impact, Annualized Peg Volatility, and Price level for > 90% time are proposed to be tracked. The document also includes a proposal to swap 250k aUSDT and 250k aUSDC for GHO and create an allowance for 500k GHO.

Keywords: GHO, DeFi, liquidity, budget, performance indicators, strategic focus, peg resilience, utility creation, TVL DEX Liquidity Pools, TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools, DEX Liquidity Composition, Swap Price Impact, Annualized Peg Volatility, Price level for > 90% time.

2. On the Aave V2 Ethereum market, large holders currently profit around 336 bps and 344 bps based on the existing emission schedule across DAI and USDC pools through recursive borrowing. With the new proposed emission schedule, this profit decreases to 289 bps and 292 bps before gas.

3. The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC could potentially attract assets from the Aave V2 Ethereum market, increasing vAPR in those pools. This could be mitigated by adjusting the distribution schedule across both markets.

4. Economically, the Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is around $44.5K per day, with daily aToken interest at around $1.9K per day. Liquidity Mining costs are estimated to be $168,630 per day under the new proposal, down from $231,000 per day under the previous LM.

1. It defines two interfaces for smart contracts, one for a stable pool (`stable_pool`) and another for a linear pool (`linear_pool`). These interfaces are used to interact with specific functions of these contracts.

2. It also defines three addresses: `GAUNTLET_FEE_SETTER`, `GAUNTLET_AMP_SETTER`, and `BALLERS_MULTISIG`. These addresses represent accounts that have certain roles in the system.

3. It defines two more addresses, `AAVE_LINEAR_FACTORY` and `STABLE_PHANTOM_FACTORY`, which are factories for creating linear pools on the Aave and Phantom protocols respectively.

4. The script then creates roles for each function that can be granted to the specified accounts using the `authorizer` contract. It does this by calling the `grantRoles` function of the `authorizer` contract, passing in an array of role IDs (which are created using the `roleId` function) and the address of the account that should receive these roles.

   - In step 1, it grants the `setSwapFeePercentage` role to the `GAUNTLET_FEE_SETTER` for the stable pool.
   - In step 2, it grants the `startAmplificationParameterUpdate` and `stopAmplificationParameterUpdate` roles to the `GAUNTLET_AMP_SETTER` for the stable pool.
   - In step 3, it grants multiple roles (`setTokenRateCacheDuration`, `setTargets`, and `setSwapFeePercentage`) to the `BALLERS_MULTISIG` account for both the Aave linear pool and the Phantom stable pool factories.

3. The estimated BAL/ETH price is queried from an 80/20 BAL/WETH pool, acting as a real-time oracle and not used to compute the actual award amount.

4. The final result displayed to the user is the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for the particular trade, assuming funds are still available in the budget, along with a USD estimate using CoinGecko's API for BAL/USD price.

5. At dispersal time, the number of eligible swaps is determined, and the gas reimbursement amount depends on this count. The actual gas price is the median from the block containing the trade, with artificially low-price transactions filtered out. The actual BAL/ETH price is queried from CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

6. The only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are minor: the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block, and the 80/20 BAL/WETH price may not perfectly match CoinGecko’s BAL/ETH price.

7. The user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time, improving the overall user experience and potentially attracting more traders to the campaign.

594," The text presents a proposal for whitelisting a gauge for a pool on Balancer.fi, specifically a FOLD/WETH pair. The proposal is from Manifold Finance, a platform that provides access to high-value transaction pools through their infrastructure called SecureRPC. They aggregate multiple endpoints and mining pools. The motivation behind this proposal is to deepen liquidity as current onchain liquidity is low but volume incentives and bribes have been high in recent days.

The governance model of Manifold Finance uses an elected dictator system, where FOLD token holders delegate control to one address (the dictator) in exchange for rewards. The protocol fees are collected in a vault and distributed over time to prevent MEV attacks. They also maintain a multisig address for voting in governance proposals of other DAOs, which will be migrated to a vault-based permissive action list structure.

The pool in question has seen significant volume since its activation and currently offers a high APR. The proposal includes links to Manifold Finance's website, documentation, GitHub, forum, and Twitter for further information. However, it also mentions potential centralization risks such as the use of a centralized service for governance discussions and the presence of certain account addresses with large amounts of FOLD tokens.

766," This text provides an overview of the security considerations, risks, and proposed risk parameters for a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform called StakeWise. The platform is designed to allow users to stake their ETH and earn rETH2 in return.

   *Counterparty risks* are mitigated by using an Oracle network to accurately report daily staking rewards. Currently, there are 5 oracles live on the network, with plans to increase this number to 10 over the coming months. The protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO, which has additional security features in place to prevent malicious transactions.

   *Staking risks* such as slashing events and downtime penalties are mitigated through vetting of prospective node operators, providing them with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, and working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance (expected by early May). The StakeWise DAO also controls the exit signatures for its operators, making it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage.

   *Smart contract risks* are mitigated through audits by 3 separate auditors and a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI. The protocol's code is open-source and available on GitHub.

   The proposed risk parameters for sETH2 include an LTV of 70%, a liquidation threshold of 75%, a liquidation bonus of 7.5%, and a reserve factor of 10%. These parameters are presented in comparison to those of ETH and are similar to the current risk parameters of stETH. The interest rate model for sETH2 includes a UOptimal of 50%, a base of 0%, slope 1 of 8%, and slope 2 of 200%.

   In summary, StakeWise is a DeFi platform that allows users to stake their ETH and earn rETH2. The platform uses an Oracle network for counterparty risk mitigation, has additional security features in place to prevent malicious transactions, and has proposed risk parameters that are similar to those of ETH and stETH.

This stablecoin, called Real USD (USDR), was created by Tangible, a RWA tokenization protocol. The text highlights two competitive advantages: the rental yield paid out daily to holders and the potential appreciation of the backing Real Estate. The USDR has only been around for a few months but is looking to grow deep liquidity, with Balancer's mechanism for automatically bribing pools being particularly appealing due to its potential to highlight the structural advantages of backing a stablecoin with yield-producing Real Estate. The text also mentions governance, oracles, audits, centralization vectors, market history, and value, but these details are not extensively discussed.",,neutral
771," The text discusses DeFi lending protocols that use token rewards to attract users but this can negatively impact token prices due to high emission rates.

774," This text outlines a proposal for the Aave DAO to evolve its Liquidity Committee into the Aave Liquidity Committee, focusing on leveraging excess voting power for tangible rewards through participation in various voting markets.

Key aspects of this proposal include:

1. Diversification of asset categories to reduce dependence on AAVE as a backstop and explore the inclusion of GHO LP assets for rewards from other protocols.
2. A 90-day emission forecast for community feedback, with iterative emission cycles to target specific asset categories and improve correlations between bad debt potential while maintaining a base level of insurance.
3. Capital efficiency improvements through optimizing emission schedules to balance attracting and retaining new deposits for each respective category.
4. Creation of an analytics dashboard to track the effective coverage of the insurance fund under various market conditions, promoting transparency and providing insight into the performance of the Safety Module as an effective insurance fund for the DAO.

The proposal also includes specifications for creating two 180-day streams for 220k and 180k GHO, with TokenLogic and karpatkey periodically claiming a fraction of the budget during the stream duration. Additionally, they will be included in the Gas Rebate program and will jointly lead the GLC upon the AIP onboarding them as service providers passing.

The proposal is not compensated beyond the Aave protocol, with both TokenLogic and karpatkey being delegates within the Aave ecosystem. The copyright and related rights are waived via CC0.",,bearish

778," This text proposes updating the Safety Module (SM) coverage for Aave Protocol on Polygon and Avalanche networks, with SM coverage being removed from Polygon v2 and Avalanche v2 deployments and extended to Avalanche v3. The motivation behind this change is to encourage users to migrate to v3 as it has a larger market size compared to v2. The text also mentions that the Polygon Aave v3 deployment is already covered by the SM, while the Avalanche v3 deployment is not, and seeks to extend the SM coverage to include Avalanche v3. The text concludes with a list of current SM-covered deployments and a disclaimer stating that TokenLogic receives no payment for creating this proposal. Overall sentiment: informative and encouraging migration to Aave v3.",,bullish
779," This text discusses a community vote regarding the pricing approach for WBTC on the Aave platform. The options are to either keep the current pricing model based on BTC or switch to a new model using WBTC-based feeds. The discussion is significant as it affects the upcoming Aave v3 Ethereum, and the community's decision will apply to this version. If option 2 is chosen, efforts will be made to adapt other Aave instances to the new pricing approach.
