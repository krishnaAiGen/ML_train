0,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708)

### Summary

This proposal is to whitelist [Aura Finance](0) in Balancer’s [VotingEscrow](1) contract allowing Aura Finance to lock `BAL` (in the form of [80/20 BAL/WETH BPT](3)), participate in Balancer governance, and provide additional rewards to Balancer ecosystem participants without immediate disposal of `BAL` rewards.

### Abstract

Aura Finance is a protocol built on top of the Balancer system to provide maximum incentives to Balancer LPs and `BAL` stakers through social aggregation of `$BAL` deposits and Aura’s native token `$AURA` .

For BAL stakers, Aura provides a seamless onboarding process to `veBAL` , by creating a tokenised wrapper token called `auraBAL` that represents the 80/20 BPT locked up for the maximum time in VotingEscrow. This can be staked to receive existing rewards ( `$BAL` and `bbaUSD` revenue) from Balancer, in addition to Aura system revenue in the form of `$BAL` , and additional `$AURA` . Users can trade their `auraBAL` back to `BAL` at any time through a deep StablePool BPT.

For Liquidity providers, Aura abstracts away complexity of the Balancer gauge boosting system, providing a smooth onboarding process to all Balancer gauge deposits. Aura allows depositors to achieve a high boost through the protocol owned `veBAL` while also accumulating additional `$AURA` rewards.

`BAL` locked in Aura will be taken out of circulation “Ad vitam æternam”. Being aligned with the DAO is our goal, with this implementation seeking to be fully symbiotic.

### $AURA & Governance

Aura Finance also proposes the `$AURA` token to act as a governance and incentivisation tool within the ecosystem. Locked `AURA` tokens will have governance rights in the system and will be able to vote using the protocol owned `veBAL` voting power. The goal of `$AURA` is to create a flourishing ecosystem on top of Balancer.

***With great power comes great responsibility***... The protocol is expected to control a large stake of the veBAL voting power. This has a huge economic power as it effectively controls the flow of Balancer incentives over the next 20 years. It is therefore important that this control is fully decentralized. Aura has added vote delegation to the system to allow this to take place fully on chain. Once the voter base has sufficiently matured, control will be passed from the starting 4 of 7 multisig, to a suite of on chain contracts.

The Aura Voting contract has support for [EIP1271](4) meaning that the results of on chain votes can be forwarded to [Snapshot](5) to participate in Balancer governance. This transition should take place as soon as the Aura voting contracts are battle tested and the voter base has matured (~3-4 months post launch).

***Amuse Bouche*** - Without giving too much details, here is a quick overview of high level `AURA` distribution:

- 50% Balancer LP rewards Rewarded pro-rata for BAL received on Aura
- 10% for StableSwap auraBAL/BPT over 4 years
- 5% for Aura/ETH incentives
- 17.5% Treasury vested
- 2.5% bootstrapping token holder base*
- 1% for future incentives
- **2% BAL treasury over 2 years**
- **2% system bootstrapping incentives**
- 10% for the Aura team over 2 years
- **100% Fair launched no VC - Seed investors**

*Voting positively on the allowlist proposal will have an additional 2-3x boost in the bootstrapping phase based on their BAL balance

The release schedule for AURA is thus depicted as follows:

![auradistro|592x344](upload://21ihgMbtLLSPir0mG0ipkW8LlMp.png)

### Team

The Aura team comprises DeFi builders and pioneers with a track record of delivering.

Aura Finance is currently undergoing an audit with Peckshield, and is planning to conduct two further audits with top tier firms.

### Proposal specification

It is proposed that the Balancer multisig add a smart wallet checker on the `veBAL` contract, and subsequently whitelist the depositor contract provided by Aura Finance following a successful proposal. The Balancer team would manually review this contract before whitelisting.

In the interests of keeping Aura 100% fair launch and with no VCs, it is also proposed that the Balancer treasury DAO provide the Aura treasury with a $300k grant in order to reimburse for audit costs and to be spent on further security (e.g. codearena).

**SPEC**

Allowlist the following contract on the veBAL smart_wallet_checker once available: [`0xaf52695e1bb01a16d33d7194c28c42b10e0dbec2`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaf52695e1bb01a16d33d7194c28c42b10e0dbec2)

There is over 300,000 CAKE made every single day. This is diluting the market, making all our CAKE worth less. 

If this continues, CAKE will continue to lose value. 

We should reduce the CAKE effective emission to 20,000 CAKE per day and continue to decrease the mint rate. 

This would drop staking rewards considerably. However, this would stop the price of CAKE from dropping forever.",bearish
2,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal aims to leverage data analysis and segmentation to identify and address barriers to participation in ApeCoin DAO, enabling the development of tailored onboarding incentives and initiatives. By gaining insights into the interests and activity patterns of $APE token holders, the DAO can optimize its governance processes and foster a more engaged and vibrant community.

#### OVERALL COST

We request total funding of $15,000 with the following breakdown: 
33% ($5,000) after Milestone 1 and the remaining 67% ($10,000) after Milestone 2.

4,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes GamiFi.gg ($GMI) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with GamiFi.gg! GamiFi.gg is a new IDO launchpad that focuses on launching blockchain based games such as P2E, Metaverses, NFT games, and more!

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $GMI tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 15,500,000 GAMIFI
 - **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 30 Mar 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 29 Apr 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 17.939 GMI

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the $GMI Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a GMI-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the boosted period if it underperforms its peers via such metrics: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BSC, fundamental token issues, etc. 
 
#### What is $GMI?

From the team: “Blockchain enabled games are not only the next big thing, but the intersection of different aspects of the crypto ecosystem. NFTs, the Metaverse, and in-game assets are just scratching the surface of what blockchain and gaming can achieve together.

GamiFi.gg is here to help launch these projects to the world by specializing in IDOs for gaming projects.

The amount of $GMI tokens users hold will determine their IDO allocation, and $GMI can be used to purchase NFTs that enable instant whitelisting.”

9,"So many Proposals take up unneeded space in the voting area, that distracts from proposals that may hold some value.

I proposal it cost a small amount of cake that is then burned to create a proposal.  I think by doing this only people who are serious with proposals will do this.  And if you proposal or part of your proposal is adopted you get your cake back.  Other wise cake is burned to make a proposal.  This would also stop duplicate proposals that essentially say the same thing, because it will be time stamped the first proposal.

10,"## Goal of the vote

0x Labs would like to gather signal from the community on support for the proposed Metatransaction and Multiplex upgrades as proposed in [ZEIP-96](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/96).

## Scope

The forum post on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-96-metatransactionsfeaturev2-and-multiplex-upgrades/3543](https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-96-metatransactionsfeaturev2-and-multiplex-upgrades/3543).

In summary, the proposed changes will provide two main benefits: (1) improve gas efficiency of the metatransaction feature and (2) enable OTC order formats to be included in multihop transactions that would expand the sources of liquidity that can be considered and make meta-aggregation more price competitive.

A subsequent vote (ZEIP-96) will be conducted if this temperature check is successful to integrate the proposed smart contract changes to the `exchangeProxy`.

11,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-extend-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-program-4-weeks/1121).

# The Proposal
The [exchange gas reimbursement pilot](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799) will come to a close at 00:00 UTC on February 22. This proposal seeks to extend the program another four weeks, to end at 00:00 UTC on March 22. We would continue to allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy. It should be noted that three days still remain in the pilot, but at present about 20,000 BAL would still remain from that initial budget, and those tokens should be used toward the 30,000 BAL budget for this extension. The remainder will be taken from the Balancer Ecosystem Fund.

# Motivation
The initial pilot has gone well. During its first 3.5 weeks, a total of 9332 BAL have been issued to 4568 recipients. Of these recipients, only 846 had held BAL before the start of the program, which indicates that distributing governance tokens to traders does indeed improve decentralization of voting power. This decentralization has always been one of the core goals of our liquidity mining program, but that program applies only to liquidity providers and not traders.

There has been some discussion on Discord about extending the program indefinitely, but first we need an opportunity to make refinements and collect more data to gauge the program's effect on core protocol metrics. Over the course of this four-week extension, we should be prepared to make structural modifications to the program (ratified by governance) to improve the user experience, which seems to be holding back many traders from participating. We should also, as a community, make a concerted effort to increase awareness of the program in order to grow the sample size of the data.

# Mechanics
The overarching mechanics of the gas reimbursement pilot would not change. Please see the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705) for details. Also refer to the program's [expansion to all whitelisted tokens](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799), which would remain in effect throughout this extended period.

Swaps between any two of the tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json) would be eligible for reimbursement of gas costs, with limits described in the original post and summarized here:

* Only transactions between an EOA account and the Balancer Exchange Proxy would be eligible. This roughly correlates to end users navigating the [Balancer Exchange UI](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap) and would not include DEX aggregators or most arbitrage bots.
* The maximum amount of gas to be reimbursed would be 100,000 units per swap, where there can be more than one swap in a single transaction (a swap is one leg of a multi-hop trade).
* The maximum gas price (in gwei) used would be the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block.
* Reimbursements would be made in BAL, not ETH, with the median BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko for the weekly period being used to convert.
* If the number of tokens to be distributed in a single week exceeds the 7,500 BAL budget, all reimbursements would be scaled down proportionally so that exactly 7,500 BAL are issued in total. However, there is room for flexibility here: the amount issued through Week N should never exceed N*7500; but if previously unused tokens remain they can be utilized. For example, if only 1,000 BAL are spent in Week 1 but Week 2 requires 10,000 BAL, then 2,500 BAL will be taken from the Week 1 budget and put toward Week 2 so as not to unnecessarily restrict the distribution for that week.
* Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program and the gas reimbursement pilot. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.",bearish
12,"## Summary

Request the community for a budget extension of 162’000 USDT to Sigma Prime, for security reviews of Aave Governance V3 and a.DI (completion of both after fixes), and the GHO Stability Module (GSM).

## Context

End of July, the continuous engagement of Sigma Prime <> Aave came to an end, after a quite productive year of collaboration.

From the BGD side, all the necessary projects have been finished apart from a re-review of Aave Governance v3 and a.DI, after the procedures of Certora. On the GHO side, the GSM project will be pretty soon ready for review, which will require security review resources.

We think Sigma Prime is a natural choice to finish the security reviews of these projects.

The total estimated person-days is 30, and the rate is the same as on the previous yearly engagement. If some of those person-days would not be allocated, the extra funds will be returned by SigmaPrime to the Aave Ethereum Collector.",bearish

14,"This proposal is also on [Balancer's Forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-increase-gno-cap-from-cap3-to-cap4-10m-30m/706).

# TL;DR

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). GNO adjusted liquidity has been consistently greater than $10m since December 2020.

# The Proposal

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M).

At the time of writing GNO has over $22M in total liquidity on Balancer Pools, and has thus surpassed its $10M cap.

Gnosis hopes to further strengthen synergies with Balancer in light of the upcoming launch of Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator. V2 channels orders to underlying on-chain AMMs for execution and hopes to be integrating Balancer as one of its first partners.

As Gnosis has contributed liquidity for multiple Balancer pools, Gnosis currently holds 52,146 BAL. Gnosis holds and continues to earn a significant amount of BAL tokens which it intends to transfer to GnosisDAO to hold as an investment, instead of selling in the open market.

[Balancer is currently the most liquid exchange for GNO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gnosis) and it would be good to keep incentivizing it to avoid the fragmentation of its liquidity. The GNO token migration to other exchanges could potentially reduce Balancer’s competitive advantage of having the lowest fee and slippage for GNO/ETH pairs.

# What is GNO?

GNO is the governance token of [GnosisDAO](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosisdao-a7102fcf9224), which launched Nov 23rd 2020 and has since seen significant growth in community engagement. It currently has a $164M market cap.

GnosisDAO owns several core Ethereum infrastructure components such as the Gnosis Safe which currently holds [more than 2% of the total ETH supply](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/ul0PgNtcq9MwezZThlHrgOMEIzpvEmkdwA9XoVqi). GnosisDAO will soon launch Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator that channels liquidity to on-chain AMMs such as Balancer.",neutral
15,"**Proposer**: [Llama](https://twitter.com/llamacommunity_) (dydymoon)

**Summary:** 

Llama proposed an [initial treasury strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-initial-treasury-strategy/5602) to productively deploy Aave’s treasury. This Snapshot proposal is a follow-up to request the Aave community’s feedback on whether we should implement Aave treasury strategies on sidechains or on mainnet only. The pros and cons of both options are outlined below.

**Background**

Most of the Aave’s treasury is on Ethereum mainnet. The mainnet treasury is split between Aave V1 and Aave V2 + AMM market.

-   Aave V1 reserve factor: 0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae ($865K)
-   Aave V2 + AMM reserve factor: 0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c ($20.9M)

But Aave’s treasury on other chains is growing too:
-   Aave Polygon RF: 0x7734280a4337f37fbf4651073db7c28c80b339e9 ($7.1M)
-   Aave Avalanche RF: 0x467b92af281d14cb6809913ad016a607b5ba8a36 ($660K)

This proposal solicits community feedback in order to propose strategies that fit Aave DAO’s preferences.

**Option 1: Build a strategy on each chain**

*Benefits:*
-   Avoid rebalancing the treasury
-   Allow the DAO to diversify the yield
-   Diversify the risk with several protocols
-   Reduce gas costs

*Drawbacks:*
-   Sidechain security is lower than mainnet security
-   More protocols can increase the risk
-   Implementation is complicated with several AIPs

**Option 2: Group all the reserve factor together and focus on mainnet strategies:**

*Benefits:*

-   Easier implementation (less strategies, less AIPs)
-   Mainnet security

*Drawbacks:*

-   Higher gas costs
-   Need to rebalance all RFs to Aave V2 periodically
-   Less yield opportunities

The goal of this poll is to know if the community would like to start implementing Aave strategies on each chain or on mainnet only.

If the community votes for Option 1, we will build strategies on each chain - Polygon and Avalanche today. Aave need not keep assets on sidechains in perpetuity. If there is a better yield opportunity on mainnet, Aave would still be able to bridge funds on mainnet.

However, if Option 2 is voted, Llama should focus on building strategies on mainnet only.",neutral

17,"*Summary*

Despite being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols, Uniswap’s outstanding voting power does not necessarily translate into active governance participation. In fact, many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50% vote participation rate, and some even as low as 10% or 0%. While there have been previous [campaigns ](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1653077861706739714?s=20) to encourage delegation by large UNI holders, we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated, if at all.

In healthy governance environments, proactive delegates wield significant voting power, ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met.

Therefore, this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate 2.5 million UNI to each of 4 active yet underrepresented delegates selected based on the criteria outlined below. To ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum (as explained further in Participation Requirements) or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will 1 year term so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without fulling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.

*Landscape of Uniswap Governance*

*Source: Butter*

Despite numerous improvements to Uniswap’s governance, there are still several areas that require further improvement. One prominent area is governance participation, which has witnessed a downward trend compared to late 2022 and early 2023.

Another issue is many large delegates are now inactive, and the delegators who entrusted them with delegation are either unaware about this inactivity or simply do not care. For example, there is currently several delegates with more than 2.5 million UNI delegated who never even voted onchain according to Tally, see the screenshot below.

*Source: Tally*

Therefore, further distributing governance power to active but underrepresented delegates is a positive step forward ensuring governance is more active, resilient, and robust.

**Participation Requirements**

* Must have voted on 80% (or more) of proposals (minus the proposals that were canceled) over the last 3 months (as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot). This includes both Snapshot and Onchain proposals (such as Tally or Agora)
* Must have actively participated in proposal voting for more than 3 months and have a Delegate Platform on Uniswap Forum under Delegation Pitch

**Application Criteria**

* Meets the above Participation Requirements
* Voting Power is less than 2.5 million UNI (as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot).

**Next Steps**

* Should this proposal pass on Snapshot, a 5-day period will begin where delegates that meet the above criterias are encouraged to post their application to be considered for delegation. In cases where there are more than Four qualified applicants, there will be an additional Snapshot vote to determine the top Four. Once Four or fewer applicants are selected (in case there are not enough delegates that meet the criteria), it will proceed to an onchain vote.

**Other Clarification**

-The term will be 1 year from when 2.5 M UNI is delegated.

-Should the onchain vote be approved but there are three or fewer qualified applicants because there are not enough qualified applicants, there WON'T be a subsequent application period and Snapshot vote after the initial vote to fill the remaining available recipients.

-Should the onchain vote be approved and there are qualified applicants but one or more of them are disqualified in the future due to their low vote participation, there will NOT be a new application and snapshot vote to give the opportunity to another delegate.

-As mentioned by in a previous [proposal ](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-onboarding-ekubo-inc-as-a-core-developer-of-uniswap-protocol/22085/20) seeking UNI delegation, there will be deployment of at max four new [Franchiser ](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/blob/main/spec.md) contracts, each one funded with 2.5M UNI (10M UNI total).

CAKE holders, today we are very happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from **Bella Protocol**, an aggregated user interface for existing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. Bella Protocol aims to simplify the user experience of existing DeFi protocols, and to allow users to deploy their assets and earn yield with ease.



# What is Boost?
Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, BEL-BNB will go to a 1x multiple, which will last for 7 days, and only cause temporary dilution among the other farms, and at the same time, there will be a new BEL Syrup Pool with $350k of tokens, to be earned by staking CAKE.



# The Syrup Pool:
Stake CAKE tokens to earn BEL tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 175,000 BEL
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start block:** 10189050 [**(approx. 9am UTC on August 20th)**](https://www.bscscan.com/block/countdown/10189050)
- **Finish block:** 11917050  [**(approx. 9am UTC on October 21st)**](https://www.bscscan.com/block/countdown/11917050)
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.101 BEL


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.

# What is Bella Protocol?

Bella Protocol aims to solve current pain points in the DeFi user experience, such as high gas fees and a steep learning curve, and to onboard more users into the DeFi ecosystem.
Bella Protocol offers a suite of DeFi products for a streamlined crypto banking experience. Bella provides diversified cross-platform yield farming strategies with auto-rebalancing, and caters to both new and experienced users on-chain or via Bella's custodian service. The project also minimizes the transaction gas fees involved by aggregating transactions and interacting with smart contracts in batches (once every 12 hours). Bella’s first product, Flex Savings, is live on Ethereum at [**fs.bella.fi**](fs.bella.fi). 

Bella Flex Savings v2 has been running successfully for about six months, the TVL is now $25M on Ethereum with juicy APY for USDT at 17%, USDC at 16%, HBTC at 22%, WBTC at 19%, and ARPA at 39%.

# How do you stake CAKE to earn BEL rewards?
If you own CAKE tokens, congratulations! You’re the master of your … pancakes.
Time to step up your taste buds by learning how to stake CAKE with Syrup Pool.
- Visit this webpage: [**https://pancakeswap.finance/syrup** ](https://pancakeswap.finance/syrup )
- Click “Approve CAKE” on the BEL Syrup Pool 
- Click on the stake button.
- Confirm the transaction.

BEP20 BEL will also be circulating and transferable on BSC when we start the Syrup pool, so you will be able to harvest your BEL tokens and trade on PancakeSwap at any time!



# BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING! ⚠️⚠️⚠️💀

The official BEL token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:
[**https://www.bscscan.com/token/0x8443f091997f06a61670b735ed92734f5628692f**](https://www.bscscan.com/token/0x8443f091997f06a61670b735ed92734f5628692f)

Any other BEL token will be a scam and will result in a financial loss for users. Do not buy tokens from any other token address. Always verify the token address before purchasing tokens. If you receive airdrops from another address for BEL tokens, they will be rotten tokens (but not the cool kind!), and we advise you to ignore them.",bullish
19,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/2110/17).


## Simple Summary
The partnership aims to align the interests of GnosisDAO and BalancerDAO, by increasing the collaboration between both organizations. The technical teams of both DAOs would carry out developments in the best interest of both organizations, such as completing [Stage 3](https://medium.com/@gnosisPM/cowswap-upgrades-to-final-version-by-fully-integrating-with-balancer-v2-21f4d635da1#:~:text=and%20better%20UX.-,Stage%203%20(Soon),-Balancer%2DGnosis%2DProtocol) of the Balancer-Gnosis-Protocol integration, so that Balancer users are able to place trades in GPv2 via their UI. Traders on Balancer would then always get the best prices available on-chain -or better- if CoWs are found, eventually leading to better prices for all traders of CowSwap as trades are batched and a higher trade frequency leads to increased chances for coincidence of wants.

Also, joint marketing efforts will be made, together with a token swap, to align governance interests.

## Abstract
Even though GnosisDAO and BalancerDAO have common interests, their current level of collaboration and integration isn’t enough to achieve their common goals. A partnership agreement would be necessary to increase the depth and breadth of their joint efforts, improving coordination and resource allocation to common projects.

This improvement proposal has already passed phase 1 in both protocols:
https://forum.gnosis.io/t/treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/1440
https://balancergrants.notion.site/DAO-Agreement-Process-a871f46c41f043fd83bce34007eb14ab

## Motivation
We believe that achieving a greater synergy between BalancerDAO and GnosisDAO would significantly strengthen both organizations, allowing for a more efficient planning and execution of their joint projects, backed up by healthier treasuries, with increased token diversification.

## Specification
Both parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following towards this partnership:

**Technical**
Joint work of technical teams of both DAOs to carry out developments in the best interest of both DAOs, such as completing Stage 3 of the Balancer-Gnosis-Protocol integration, so that Balancer users are able to place trades in GPv2 via their UI. Traders on Balancer will then always get the best prices available on-chain -or better- if CoWs are found. This will eventually lead to better prices for all traders of CowSwap as trades are batched and a higher trade frequency leads to increased chances for coincidence of wants.

**Marketing**
To ensure both entities will profit from each other's reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where useful.

**Token Transaction**
To align governance interests, a Token Swap between the two organizations is initiated as part of this agreement.

200,000 BAL from the Ecosystem Fund would be exchanged for the equivalent USD value of GNO in equal proportions from DAO Treasury, using the 90 day smooth moving average price at the time that voting ends.

Both organizations commit to holding the received assets for a period of at least 1 year. No on-chain logic will be implemented to ensure this.

## Rationale
Gnosis and Balancer have worked together for the past years. The protocols have [integrated Cowswap with Balancer V2](https://medium.com/@gnosisPM/cowswap-upgrades-to-final-version-by-fully-integrating-with-balancer-v2-21f4d635da1) to enable better gas prices and UX, MEV protection, no gas fees for failed transactions, better prices due to the optimized pool settlements and use of the Balancer v2 single vault architecture.

**Partnership Term**
The Partnership is open-ended and does not have an expiry date.

**Partnership Governance**
The partnership is managed by representatives of the organizations directed by the respective governance processes of the organizations. In the case of this partnership, there are 2 representatives for each organization.

**Exit Clause**
Both organizations can at any moment terminate the agreement through their respective governance systems.

**Communications around the Partnership**
- A Partnership announcement blog will be created within the 2 weeks following the agreement date.

- To ensure operational effectiveness, a monthly call will be set up with at least one representative of each entity

Both DAOs acknowledge that DAO agreements are inherently unpredictable and irreversible and agree to this initial partnership agreement.

## Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) would initiate a transaction to send 200,000 BAL to GnosisDAO (0x849d52316331967b6ff1198e5e32a0eb168d039d)

**Summary:**

> Due to the recent [vulnerability disclosure](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345), the deployment of the [ComposableStablePoolFactory-v3](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdba127fbc23fb20f5929c546af220a991b5c6e01#readContract) is configured to address the potential issues related to Balancer’s previous composable stable pools (v2).This pool uses the new pool factory and will be composed of three Euler linear pools. The underlying tokens are USDC and FRAX. These will each be wrapped through Euler’s market to earn LPs additional yield. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. The gauge can be uncapped based on the contents being all large cap stable tokens.

**Protocol Description:**

> Euler is a permissionless lending protocol custom-built to help users lend and borrow digital assets. This provides yield bearing sources for various tokens, this case the stablecoins listed above. USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. 

**Motivation:**

> Balancer’s heavy interest in taking over the yield bearing token space and increased capital efficiency through linear and boosted pool architecture continues to take effect. This provides better trading routes on the protocol and more sustainable pool options for liquidity providers to place their funds. The great migration as we are going through now will harbor many more boosted pool options for users and Balancer to tap into a wide variety of yield sources. Euler is providing the capacity for various tokens outside of bb-euler-USD, one being FRAX in this pool. 

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** USDC are centralized and does not have a governance forum. Euler’s governance details can be seen [here](https://docs.euler.finance/euler-governance/getting-started). FRAX governance process can be seen [here](https://docs.frax.finance/smart-contracts/governance) and their snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth).
2. **Oracles:** This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned. 
3. **Audits:** See Euler’s [here](https://docs.euler.finance/security/audits) FRAX See [here ](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits)
4. **Centralization vectors:** USDC is inherently centralized. FRAX governance process is highlighted above, and their stability mechanism is described [here](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/overview). Also their decentralization ratio is described [here](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/decentralization-ratio-dr).
5. **Market History:** See USDC [here ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/%5D(https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin)). and Euler [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/euler). FRAX [here ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/frax).
6. **Value:** LPs & Balancer will earn the protocol fee on underlying bb-euler-FRAX and bb-euler-USDC as well as swap fees. BIP-19 will incentivize TVL to continue to grow here with trading volume and this implementation will continue to draw in new volume, as well as showcase the power of these pool types.

> # Proposal by Gyroscope for a wstETH/WETH E-CLP on mainnet

> ## Summary
> 
> * **This is a proposal to enable a 10% capped Balancer gauge for a wstETH/WETH pool on Balancer Ethereum.**
> * **The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP)**. E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.
> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception**. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.
> * T**he pool has already been launched [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf01b0684C98CD7aDA480BFDF6e43876422fa1Fc1#code).**

> ## Protocol description
> 
> * Lido's wrapped stETH (wstETH) is stETH which is deposited into the stETH wrapper to create a new token called wstETH. stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)
> * WETH is a wrapper-token and an ERC-20 token representing ETH at a 1:1 ratio.
> * The E-CLP uses an [internal conversion](https://github.com/gyrostable/vaults/blob/main/contracts/eclp/GyroECLPPool.sol#L723) to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.

> ## Motivation
> 
> * We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency compared to the largest, existing [StableSwap pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x32296969ef14eb0c6d29669c550d4a0449130230000200000000000000000080). The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:
> 
> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.

> * *The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are illustrated by the recently deployed stMATIC/wMATIC E-CLP. The below box plot shows stMATIC/wMATIC liquidity utilisation. The stacked area chart shows how the E-CLP already reached up to 55% of the total market share of stMATIC on Polygon soon after inception, with only a fraction of total TVL.*

22,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to BNB Chain v3 Farm Rewards

As we continue to optimize CAKE rewards across all of our deployments, we are able to gradually lower the overall CAKE emission, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate a smooth trading experience. Ultimately, this enables us to contribute a greater amount of CAKE towards the weekly burn. 

The previous round of [**Adjustments to Farm Rewards**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x3e68425e233875d0ed4d553e0da44bfe927f75d56714545c7a7c7ea4a9b4a35c) increased the overall CAKE burn by approximately **4,000 CAKE per day** with minimal impact to trading volumes.

Given the traction and overall market share shown on our BNB Chain v3 deployments, this proposal aims to decrease emissions to the farms listed below and increase the overall CAKE burn by approximately **1,700 CAKE per day**.

These optimizations will add up over the coming months to 1) improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across farms and 2) redirect CAKE rewards towards the highest growth farms, ultimately accelerating the path towards ultrasound CAKE.

#### Adjustment Details

With the above in mind, we are proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below. Note, all other BNB Chain v3 farms will continue to earn the same level of rewards and even with these adjustments, the farms below will continue to have a healthy level of liquidity, volume, and APR.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their average daily volume, 14-day volume, capital efficiency, and alternatives available.

23,"##### ABSTRACT
Liquidation Loans (ZLLs). ZLLs are a novel DeFi primitive that allow (i) borrowers to borrow without liquidation risk and (ii) lenders to lend in underdeveloped credit markets with higher yield potential.

For DAOs, ZLLs are a powerful new tool to increase the utility of their native token and to enable them to use their reserves in a more productive and strategic way.

We propose the creation of a lending market for $APE, utilizing MYSO’s v2 protocol. This initiative can offer community members access to non-liquidatable loans, thereby enhancing the utility of the $APE token. If there is confidence in the continuous growth of $APE and a desire to offer more incentives to $APE token holders, establishing a non-liquidatable lending market is an effective way to achieve this objective.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
By using above described convertible Zero-Liquidation Loan product, it is possible to::
* Create credit markets for the $APE token without lengthy governance processes, oracle integrations, etc.
* Lend treasury reserves in a more strategic way that creates value for the overall community.
* Provide a unique borrowing experience to the ApeCoin’s community, without liquidation risk.
* Reduce selling pressure for the $APE token and incentivize long-term holding.
* Fully customize and control the loans one underwrites.
* Signal high conviction on the $APE token and participate in a possible synthetic buyback strategy.

SPECIFICATIONS
Using MYSO, it’s possible to offer fully customizable loan options to $APE token holders by simply setting up a lending vault and specifying the loan terms desired for lending.

For example, the grant recipient (i.e. Governance Working Group [GWG], see below) could set up a vault to lend out USDC (or any other token) and accept its native $APE token as collateral. The GWG can create multiple loan offers concurrently and define at which LTVs, tenors, and interest rates they’d feel comfortable lending. Updating/deleting these loan offers is also possible in a matter of minutes.

From a financial risk-reward perspective, the lender bears default risk that a loan may become undercollateralized and not be repaid. This resembles a deep in-the-money covered call strategy with a low delta. It’s worthwhile to mention that the risk premium is set by the GwG and can be hedged outside and independently of MYSO, if needed.

MYSO’s protocol fee starts at 0.1% and scales linearly to +0.4% for a loan with a duration of 1 year. To illustrate, the protocol fee for a loan with a 90 day tenor would therefore be at 0.2% of the collateral amount. Worthwhile to highlight that MYSO’s protocol fee is currently set at 0.00%.

MYSO v1 was deployed on Ethereum in January 2023. MYSO v2 was deployed on Mantle end of August 2023, on Ethereum end of September 2023 and on Arbitrum mid of October 2023. As of today, MYSO has a $1.25m TVL.

Other organizations that have successfully implemented MYSO’s lending protocol include:
* Olympus DAO ($500k pilot project for a gOHM/DAI lending market)
* Mantle (created a lending market for $MNT), Rocketpool (we launched the first RPL/rETH credit market for their community)
* Pendle (seeded a lending market for PT-sDAI Token), IndexCoop (to seed a lending market dsETH)


##### OVERALL COST 
$750,000 USD

In order to enable meaningful borrowing capacity, MYSO would recommend seeding $750k. It’s important to note that the GWG retains full control over their lender vault, as well as the credit markets and loans they underwrite. The GWG also has the flexibility to withdraw their funds at any time, excluding the portion currently being lent out, or add more funds to their lender vault if they wish to do so.

**Summary:**

> Puffer Finance is a unique solution introduced in the heart of the liquid restaking craze the has been sweeping the Defi ecosystem. The purpose of this gauge is give pufETH holders a place to keep their liquidity and not be susceptible to rate arbitrage over time, while earning yield on wstETH and via Balancer's core pool infrastructure

>
>
> This gauge is uncapped, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329).

**Protocol Description:**

> Puffer is a native liquid restaking protocol (nLRP) designed to optimize the potential of restaking, built on Eigenlayer. It offers a comprehensive framework for stakeholders, including Stakers and Node Operators (NoOps), to engage in decentralized validation while enhancing rewards and safeguarding Ethereum's ethos.

The protocol's design encompasses various components:

1. Protocol Features:
  * Permissionless operation allows anyone to become a validator on Puffer, promoting accessibility.
  * Native Restaking introduces the first liquid restaking protocol on Eigenlayer.
  * Ethos Alignment ensures the protocol's self-capping mechanism to protect Ethereum's integrity.
  * Explosive Growth potential for the protocol's native asset, pufETH, irrespective of validator queue lengths.
2. NoOps Advantages:
  * Capital Efficiency requires less than 2 ETH to operate a validator, encouraging wider participation.
  * Slash Protection through anti-slashing hardware support mitigates risks.
  * MEV Autonomy empowers NoOps to tailor their MEV strategy, enhancing Ethereum's resilience.
3. Rewards Mechanism:
  * Liquid Staking allows stakeholders to stake any amount of ETH, promoting flexibility.
  * Restaking Rewards integration with Eigenlayer amplifies rewards for participants.
  * Validator Tickets incentivize participation and create new markets within the ecosystem.
  * Liquid Rewards ensure immediate liquidity for NoOps' execution rewards.

>The Puffer Flywheel relies on collaborative efforts between Stakers and NoOps to drive growth while maintaining Ethereum's credibility. Governance oversees the creation and management of restaking modules, ensuring alignment with protocol objectives.

The process involves:

* Staking ETH to mint pufETH tokens, providing a redeemable receipt for restaked ETH.
* Registering a NoOp Validator by depositing validator tickets and collateral.
* Provisioning ETH to NoOps' pending validators, ensuring fair servicing of protocol modules.
* Earning PoS and Restaking Rewards based on validator performance and AVS execution.
* Exiting Validators involves validating proof of exit and compensation for potential penalties.

Overall, Puffer offers a robust ecosystem for stakeholders to participate in decentralized validation, optimize rewards, and contribute to Ethereum's decentralization and security.

**Motivation:**

> As pufETH grows in popularity and is able to generate yield for the holders, Balancer's tech utilizing rate provider oracles remains the optimal solution for liquidity providers retaining their yield. This will prove competitive over the long haul giving independent holders the option to choose between various Dexes for where to support their yield bearing assets. Balancer will also be providing incentives via their core pool mechanics.

title: [ARFC] Deploy USDC and USDT GSM On Arbitrum
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
created: 2024-06-30

---

# Summary

This publication proposes deploying a USDC and USDT GHO Stability Module (GSM) on the Arbitrum network. The two GSMs are to be maintained by the GHO Stewards.

# Motivation

The GSM provides stability to the GHO peg by enabling assets to be exchanged within a defined price band. Deploying a GSM on the Arbitrum network enables swaps to be filled without unnecessarily creating an arbitrage opportunity between networks. 

With the LTIPP ARB grant coinciding with GHO being launched on Arbtirum, the Aave DAO can stimulate demand for GHO whilst also restricting the Bridge Facilitator mint cap to encourage users to mint GHO via the GSMs. User will also be able to swap USDC and USDT for GHO via aggregators that have integrated the GSM. This will lead to USDC and USDT being deposited into the GSM.

With a healthy balance of USDC and USDT in each respective GSM, the Bridge Facilitator cap can be raised more aggressively and a GHO Bucket Cap with Facilitor role can be introduced to Aave v3 on Arbitrum. 

# Specification


The below outline the proposed changes to be included in the governance proposal submission.

## Ethereum

Creating a new gauge means governance participants would then be able to allocate their voting power to it which would then reward stakers with CRV. The gauge would be introduced at 0 allocation.

The gauge would have a 50% admin fee on Uniswap profits which means 50% of profits would be collected by the DAO and distributed to veCRV holders on withdrawal. If there were no profits, the withdrawal fee will be free.",bullish
35,"In the case of the CAKE token, all transactions by SWAPS use a fee of 0.5% that are intended for treasury, liquidity providers and burning. In CAKE the token burn is 0.0575%.

Knowing the above, I propose something different, but keeping and adding the above, and that is to use the power of compound interest to store value both in CAKE-BNB, and even other tokens that are neither BNB nor CAKE, this proposal can be extended to all liquidity pools to make all tokens deflationary. But first we will briefly talk about the compound interest applied in my proposal to see how it would be implemented.

Liquidity holders earn 0.17% of CAKE-BNB fees, the more Daily Trading Volume you have, the larger pool will be the reward for liquidity providers, if a user's share is 0.1% and the daily volume was $63,000, I earn $0.1071, now let's assume that you added liquidity and your weight in the pool is 50%, if the volume is $63,000 again you will have earned $53.55

That being said, we will add the compound interest to the liquidity holder who theoretically owns 0.1%=54,000 value in CAKE in the CAKE-BNB pool, we will assume that the daily volume gives liquidity providers profit of a constant 1% for 5, 10, 100 or 1000 years exaggerating, and no one withdraws their participation in this example.

We are only focusing on the liquidity provider you name as Wallet X.

(in year 0 and 1 I have a miscalculation in supplier liquidity, so I left it like that)

As you will see in the image summers, an initial capital of the wallet x of $54,000 and in 1,000 years it would have accumulated a total of $2,423,759, it will have earned $2,369,759 in 1.000 years, half of the LP would be CAKE and BNB. Here we will not calculate the value locked in CAKE, not in USD.

With the example above we only used 0.38% in annual fees as that is the current APR on fees. But the greater the volume, the greater the amount of blocked tokes of both CAKE and BNB.

My proposal is to create a new DEADWALLET or an existing one, which accumulates LP tokes. This brings several benefits:

1- The Pool created will always have liquidity, even if said liquidity is Minimum, in case the pool does not have liquidity providers there will always be the DeadWallet that will collect the funds so that all users can exchange, even if the impact price is extremely high and no longer have liquidity providers.

2- The above is an insurance built by the exchanges made from the same community. A short example, let’s say what happened with Luna. Unable to execute SWAPS on some DEXs because providers withdrew their LP tokens.(extreme panic)

3- Instead of destroying the market capital or burning the tokens, both tokens are added to all liquidity pools and the supply and demand of both tokens would increase.

4- BNB and CAKE would in this case be the most deflationary currency in the crypto ecosystem by protocol without having to burn it. It will only be trapped in the smart contract with the token that is linked in the pool.

One way to get funds from each Pool is from the 0.17% fee paid to liquidity providers. You can raise that fee to 0.03% or 0.17% to charge 0.03%. Said charge could be collected at the beginning of all the pools, this for a short period of time while DeadWallet is gaining strength to accumulate both tokes of a pair. It could be 1 or 2 months.

The second way to accumulate funds is through donations from the community itself. The public address of the DeadWallet is shared and the community donates their LP tokes to that address.

The third way is to implement the previous 2. If the same community wants the token to be more inflationary and sees that I don’t accumulate enough LP tokens in the accumulation period (1 or 2 months) the same community can donate their own LP tokens to boost deflation. An example would be that I donate my LP valued at 10 CAKE and another person donates 100 CAKE, this would be voluntary.

The fourth way to get the funds would be to allocate 1 week of the burning of CAKE to the most VOTED pair. By the community, and it can be the most voted pool every 2 or 3 months.

The fifth way, it can be all of the above

Finally, this DeadWallet will never be able to farm, since it will only be possible to send more tokes, it will not be possible to interact with that wallet.

36,"**TLDR**: This proposal adds Manta Pacific to the v3 deployments record and grants Manta an Onboarding Package, which includes $250k of UNI incentives for three months on four key markets and Angle Merkl’s integration of Manta. Separate from this proposal, Manta has arranged for Oku to support Manta, and the contracts have been deployed.

The following are the proposed pools for the program, but they can be amended for the onchain vote.
 * ETH/STONE 0.05% - 30%
 * ETH/USDC 0.05% - 40%
 * USDC/USDT 0.01% - 10%
 * MANTA/USDC 0.30% - 20%

The Manta team has committed to providing incentives alongside the Uniswap DAO and plans to solidify their exact plans once this Temperature is successful and prior to the onchain vote.

Key points:
* Manta has already contracted with Oku to support the new deployment.
* The contracts have been deployed and verified.
* The deployment is ready for immediate launch.

45,"**Summary** :

sUSD is a decentralized stable coin over collateralized by the SNX token. sUSD is already listed on AAVE markets as a lendable asset as well as SNX which can be used as collateral in addition to borrow/lending. There is significant liquidity for sUSD on both Mainnet and Optimism. I am proposing for it to be enabled as collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism with a 10 million sUSD supply cap.

**Risk Parameters**
- set sUSD max LTV to 60%
- set liquidation threshold to 75%
- set liquidation penalty to 5%
- upgrade the interest rate curve to that of DAI/TUSD
- Fixed lending is not enabled.

**Motivation**

sUSD market cap has grown tremendously over the past year, and the steady demand for decentralized stable coins has contributed to its growth. sUSD is highly over collateralized by SNX, the governance token, and backstop for the Synthetix protocol.

The rise in its liquidity on major dexes has contributed to sUSD stability over the past year, and allowing collateral use would promote its liquidity in aave markets.

**Rationale**

SNX stakers are incentivized to actively manage their debt relative to their SNX stake and sometimes cause spikes in demand for sUSD on markets including AAVE (especially when there are other Yield generating opportunities with sUSD), this may cause small deviations from the peg but with low volatility.

From a counter-party risk perspective, all underlying functions in relation to sUSD are fundamentally the same as that of SNX.

The SNX and sUSD contracts are fully upgradeable. Still, all changes must go through a formal governance process from SIP to deployment, which would be announced well before the upgrades are made and thus does not present a substantial counter-party risk.

The sUSDv2CRV pool has deep liquidity on L1, and with incentivizes, the L2 pool will soon have deep liquidity. 

In addition to sUSD, there are other synth pools on Curve with emission gauges to supplement sUSD liquidity (sBTC, sETH ). All synths are redeemable at their dollar value in sUSD at the ChainLink quoted price through the Synthetix protocol or Curve (via cross-asset swaps); thus they help facilitate the arbitrage sUSD peg deviations.

46,"## [ARFC]  Deploy a Lido Aave v3 Instance

## Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

## Date: 2024-06-24

---

## **Summary**

This proposal suggests joining the Lido Alliance as the Aave DAO and deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on the Lido ecosystem.

## **Motivation**

Aave and Lido have historically seen symbiotic growth, with stETH being one of the premier collaterals on Aave and leveraged staking being one of the most profitable use cases for both Aave DAO and Lido users.

Lido is in the process of launching the Lido Alliance, which will reward novel use cases of staked ETH and support further growth of the Lido ecosystem. This ARFC proposal suggests that Aave supports Lido Alliance efforts by deploying a new Aave V3 ETH market for Lido. This Aave v3 instance will be designed and tuned to support stETH leverage loopers. The deployment will only include wstETH and wETH assets with E-Mode enabled.

Lido has committed incentive programs and ecosystem support for this instance in order to bootstrap liquidity and promote additional programs within the Lido Alliance.

This market will be bootstrapped with wETH from the Ahab program to attract wETH liquidity.

wETH suppliers will also be proposed to be eligible to a dedicated Merit Boost

Incentives from Lido will be detailed ahead of the AIP deployment. 

## Specification

The Lido Alliance’s Aave v3 instance implements the following:

- The borrow cap of wETH will be set to 90% of supplied wETH, with updates tightly controlled by the risk steward. This will ensure that stETH/wETH loops are consistently profitable and can't go into negative territory.
- E-Mode LTV & LT are set 50 bps above all other Aave implementations, making it the most efficient loop venue in the industry.
- For the first 6 months of the Lido Alliance Aave v3, wETH slope1 will be set at 2.50%, ((currently 2.7% on mainnet and on L2s) and wETH RF set at 10% (currently 15% on all markets). This will make it the most profitable venue to loop stETH & wETH.
- wstETH RF will be 5%.

The deployment of the Aave V3 Lido Ecosystem Aave will be done by Catapulta on behalf of the Aave DAO.

As you can see, once that GMT Syrup pool runs out we are going to be in a lot of trouble with not having any syrup pools.  23,000,000 CAKE is staked in that one Syrup Pool. 

I purpose to make the Syrup Pools last 120 Days at half the current APR%.  Make the Syrup Pools Pay out Slower. 

 
 We could even go as far as making them last 180Days and payout 66% slower.  

The APRs of the Syrup Pools would be 30% - 40%, but the Syrup pools will last longer. This will give more projects time to launch on Pancakeswap and for current projects to add more tokens to extend their Syrup Pools.  

It will also help investors not worry about dumping their Cake when big pools like the GMT are going to expire.",bearish

### [ARFC]  Onboard wbETH on Aave V3 BNB Chain

### Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

### Date: 2024-04-02

---

### **Summary**

This ARFC proposes the addition of wbETH the Binance Liquid Staked ETH Token to Aave V3 BNB Chain to enhance LST liquidity and asset diversity.

## **Motivation**

Liquid Staked Tokens are one of the premier collateral types on Aave and drive most of the ETH borrow demand. wBETH is one of the largest Liquid Staking Tokens on the market and one of the more productive assets available on BNB Chain.

The Aave-Chan Initiative supports LST diversity in Aave V3 and looks to add more LST to the new BNB Chain deployment.

## **Specification**

# Summary

As a recap, on 13 April 2022, a [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-incorporation-of-the-balancer-foundation/2989) was brought to the BalancerDAO (or the “DAO”) to incorporate the Balancer Foundation (or the “Foundation”). The Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work, furthering Balancer’s decentralization goals, and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.

The Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate, and provides, among others, two primary benefits:

It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts. In addition, for example, it intends to establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto.

It encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, it could engage business development or tech providers.

In short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the BalancerDAO in the structure of the traditional business world.

The Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.

Running a Foundation Company comes with certain real-world costs and financial reserve requirements. These are laid out below, first in summary and then in detail for reference.

## Specification - Foundation Expenses and reserves

This proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2022 running through March 2023, and a self-insurance reserve.

### Foundation Expenses

The summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.

The Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, so April / May /June is the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, although it is the first quarter for which funding is requested.

1. Q2 FY22 - USDC 32,941 - actual expenses incurred through the end of May 2022 and forecast for June 2022 - immediate payment requested
2. Q3 FY22 - USDC 67,919 - for transfer 25 June 2022
3. Q4 FY22 - USDC 67,969 - for transfer 25 September 2022
4. Q1 FY23 - USDC 78,384 - for transfer 15 December 2022

The table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter. Descriptions for each line item are included under the “Detail” section further below.

![|624x417.174903581549](upload://vPqyfiEv162ngVFJ64ipxJDv5Ii.jpeg)

### Foundation Self Insurance Reserve

As part of this proposal, we are asking BalancerDAO to hold the equivalent of US$500,000 as a self-insurance reserve, earmarked for a year and to be revisited after a year. The reserve can be maintained in BAL tokens given current market conditions, but must at all times be available to the Foundation should it be needed, and must be maintained at an equivalent value of US$500,000. More on this reserve requirement can be found in the “Detail” section below.

Note: the proposal is for funding at the Balancer Foundation level, it does not include funding for:

1. Balancer OpCo Limited, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) subsidiary and operating company that will house the front-end development team for BalancerDAO,
2. Other third-party service providers to the BalancerDAO, such as Orb Collective and Kolektivo Labs.

Proposals for funding these three entities will follow separately.

# Detail

For reference, please see below descriptions of the individual line items.

## Annual Secretary Fee

Under Cayman Law, a foundation company must at all times have a secretary who is a 'qualified person' (i.e. a person licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services). The secretary has a duty to ensure that the company complies with applicable Cayman Islands legislation governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.

Neither the secretary fee nor the registered office fee includes the preparation of minutes and resolutions. The Foundation will prepare these for typical matters but might seek assistance from Campbells if complex matters arise.

These fees are due in January each year.

## Registered Office and Registrar of Companies fees (via Campbells Corporate Services Cayman)

Annual registered office and registrar fee – US$2,915.12, which consists of:

- Registered Office fee of US$ 1,495.00

- Beneficial Ownership Reporting and Register Maintenance Fee of US$225.00

- Economic Substance Notification Fee of US$125.00

- Registrar Annual Return Fee of US$853.66

- Supplementary Registered Office License Fee of US$91.46

- Sundry Disbursements of US$125.00

Includes:

- providing the registered office and registered agent

- maintaining the statutory registers

- preparation and submission of annual returns

- filing economic substance notifications

- maintaining the UBO register and reporting on the same

These fees are due in January each year.

## Additional Campbells Corporate Services costs

Any legal advice that may be requested from time to time will be charged on a time spent basis. Any additional corporate requests (for example, requests for certificates, certified documents, updates to registers, filing changes, mail forward, etc – these are all in addition to the annual fees) will also be charged separately.

## Governance/Supervisory Services

### Non-Executive Director and Supervisor Responsibilities

Under the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.

“Supervisor”, for a foundation company, means a person, other than a member, who under the foundation company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.

The non-executive director responsibilities are:

* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors
* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation
* To work with the wider board of directors to:
  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;
  * set an agenda for board meetings;
  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate
* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate
* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission
* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary
* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director
* Set the tone to involve the Balancer ecosystem in developing long-range programs to support and increase all types of contributions to Balancer projects
* Set the tone to harmonize the ecosystem working with the board, the service providers, and projects and adjacent foundations to find opportunities to collaborate and reduce confusion.

### Community Board Member duties

The Directors have ultimate responsibility for the management of the Foundation. In particular, the Director’s responsibilities will include:

* complying with all reasonable requests, instructions and regulations made or given by the Board (or by any duly authorized committee thereof) and give to the Board such explanations, information, and assistance the Board may reasonably require

* attending all meetings of the Board in person or by video/phone; provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary, as applicable, with reasonable advance notice; and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances;

* bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO, strategy, policy, resources, performance, and regulatory matters;

* providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, adherence to terms set forth in the Articles;

* planning, developing, and enhancing the future strategic direction of the DAO

* sharing responsibility with the other director(s) of the Company for the effective management of the Company

### CEO/Management duties

The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Foundation, which includes the following roles:

1. Liaising with the board on all budgets, project proposals, and matters particularly as it relates to service providers including the BVI subsidiary

* Reporting to the board in a timely manner on all matters of importance including financial status, funding projections, policy setting, planning, program operations, employee matters, and the long-term health of the ecosystem.
* Providing adequate materials and analysis to assist the board in making decisions on all matters of importance.

2. Manage Finances and Service Providers

* Overseeing all financial management of the Foundation, including budgets for Board approval, grant, and funding administration required by either the Foundation or other supporters. Possessing thorough knowledge of all funding sources and required records.
* Maintaining and adapting the organizational structure and systems capable of meeting the needs of the Foundation in carrying out its mission.
* Overseeing BVI subsidiary operations including staff and logins as needed (Twitter, GitHub, Discord). Contracts with BVI for service providers.
* Setting up and administering the Foundation’s bank account
* Setting up and managing token custodian

3. Involving the board, ecosystem participants, service provider staff as needed in developing organizational goals, a strategic plan, and projections for supporting the Balancer mission through service providers (Orb Collective Inc and BVI subsidiary) and the community.

* Overseeing vendors & others involved in actively seeking software and product developments and funds as needed.
* Ensuring that the Balancer projects delegated to service providers and the ecosystem have clear objectives that are within the scope of the resources and mission of the Foundation.
* Overseeing the gathering, analysis, and reporting of data illustrating the work accomplished by service providers to manage performance and deliverables
* Reviewing program evaluation results and developing and executing strategies for continual improvement.

4. Compliance

* Responsible for all necessary filings, responses to inquiries, management of AML Compliance vendor, and other Cayman Foundation compliance and risk-related matters

5. and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation.

## Legal Counsel

The Foundation may from time to time require advice on matters of Cayman law. It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item. We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter. For clarity, this refers to the legal team rather than the corporate services team.

## Self Insurance

It is typical for an organization to obtain insurance to protect itself against the legal, regulatory and operational risks, as well as to protect the directors and officers from personal liability for carrying out their duties. We have not seen reasonable insurance for organizations of this nature in the market, hence the need to self-insure.

We are asking for $500,000 based on the costs of defending Balancer in the event of a regulatory inquiry, class action or other lawsuit or vulnerability to the ecosystem. The self-insurance is based on recent DeFi matters within the last 12 months which have cost on average $100,000 monthly to defend. It is important to note, that we have excluded any reserve for payment of damages, fines, or impact on users.

Since this is a reserve and not an expense, the Directors may assess in the future that a lower reserve amount becomes sufficient and propose changes to the DAO. We are asking that the DAO bookmarks these funds to hold for self-insurance.

## Bank Fees

The Foundation is working to establish a bank relationship that we are advised could take approximately 6-8 weeks once the application is complete and submitted. This line item is an estimate/placeholder for monthly fees

## Accounting Software

Estimate for monthly software subscription fees.

**Service Description:**

Service Cost: ($3K USD/mo starting with a 1 month paid trial, with the goal to continue into a 1-Year Contract after a successful trial). We will be paid directly by AlphaGrowth from their Growth Program Budget.

As Compound continues to grow and scale, bad actors have an increasing incentive to target the community, organization, and staff members. Online threats vary in nature across each platform and ChainPatrol specializes in detecting, blocking, and taking down these active threats (impersonations, phishing links, wallet drainers).

Our takedown service covers domains, social platforms, and app stores, with social takedowns spanning across X.com, Discord, Telegram, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok, Facebook, and decentralized social platforms. Additionally, ChainPatrol Reporting Bots (for Discord and Slack) facilitate easy reporting from your team and community. By partnering with ChainPatrol, Compound can ensure a secure, trusted environment for its users and stakeholders.

We have proven success with leading projects such as Arbitrum, zkSync, The Graph, Starknet, CoW Swap, Consensys,underscoring our capability to prevent the loss of community funds swiftly and effectively. ChainPatrol can block malicious domains in as little as 15 minutes across 20 leading crypto wallets, including Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, and Phantom.

**Action Items/Next Steps**:

Our aim for this snapshot vote is to get the support of the Compound Community to become a valued security partner that works closely with Compound to protect its community, users, and builders through all of the key roadmap events, mitigating the impact of these potential threats on community members.

In addition, voting “Yes” to this proposal, will also serve as permission from the Compound Community for ChainPatrol to act on the DAO’s behalf for the purpose of initiating takedowns of malicious content across all socials (see Addendums below. These are presented to the platforms we petition with takedown requests to prove we are authorized by the community to work on its behalf.)

62,"## **Summary**

- Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum. Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world.
- The Nomic Foundation's work will be focused on Ethereum's developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum's public goods support structures.
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams.
- The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum's dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components.
- Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.
- **We're proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**

## **Ethereum developer experience**

When it comes to Ethereum, which is primarily a software development platform to build decentralized systems, developer experience is a key strategic aspect for success. Ecosystem growth requires more developers to build more software on top of Ethereum. Developer adoption and learning speed, core contributors to this growth, are critically affected by developer experience.

The rate at which the ecosystem innovates, coming up with new creations and solving difficult problems, both at the dapp layer and EVM/Solidity/Vyper layer, is also directly affected by developer productivity.

Software development platforms aren't new, and playbooks established by the great developer experience success stories (Rust, .Net, TypeScript, etc) prove that achieving a quality developer experience requires a specialized approach paired with a long-term, big-picture strategy. The potential impact in executing a dedicated effort for Ethereum would increase the ecosystem’s pace of innovation and growth, building a powerful compounding effect over the long term for the entire industry.

The inspiration for our vision came from our experience building Hardhat, which allowed us to see how deeply challenging it is to build sophisticated Ethereum tooling. **These challenges must be alleviated to bring about organic ecosystem-led improvement of developer experience that achieves world-class quality.**

## **Nomic Foundation**

Nomic Labs has been fully dedicated to Ethereum developer experience since 2019, and we're [now pivoting](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/introducing-the-nomic-foundation-an-ethereum-public-goods-organization-31012af67df9) to a non-profit foundation formally dedicated to Ethereum. We're aiming to build a long-lasting organization that makes Ethereum's public goods support structures stronger by contributing to the Ethereum Foundation's existing efforts, and reducing the ecosystem's reliance on any one organization for development platform components.

### **Roadmap**

Given the size and innovation pace of the ecosystem, there's no way to foresee exactly what needs developers are going to have as things scale. However, we do know what engineering foundations the ecosystem will need in order to build its own solutions.

Our overarching engineering strategy is to empower the ecosystem to build its own specialized tools. This plan is based on four strategic pillars of the stack, each of which offers an opportunity to leverage a platform to empower the ecosystem to keep building open-source infrastructure.

For each of these pillars, we will build a platform. The four ecosystem pillars and platform opportunities we've identified are:

1. Solidity
2. EVM tooling
3. Local development environment
4. Ethereum connector library

## **The projects**

### **Slang & Rethnet**

Over the long term, these are our most important projects. Targeting the Solidity and EVM tooling pillars, Slang and Rethnet will serve as core infrastructure for the ecosystem to build new tools faster, cheaper, and better. We're essentially building the tools that would have let us build Hardhat a lot faster. We previously published a [Medium post](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/slang-rethnet-2ad465fd7880) with high-level descriptions of how both projects will complement each other.

**Slang**

A Solidity compiler designed as a platform for tooling development, an approach also known as compiler as a service. Its top priority will be servicing tools through domain-specific APIs. Much like .Net's Roslyn, it will feature a compilation pipeline made of distinct reusable components with standalone APIs. A completely modular design guarantees that others can build on top of it by replacing the part of functionality they need to, and reusing everything else:

1. Parser that is only concerned with producing trees from code. Usable on its own, for example, to create third-party formatters like Prettier plugins.
2. Semantic analysis (binding) is concerned only with building a type system and validating the produced trees. Usable on its own, to implement third-party type checking, security/threat models, and more advanced third-party linting.
3. Code generation. By replacing just this isolated part, the compiler can compile for different targets (e.g. non-EVM L2s).
4. Language services. These will receive an immutable representation of the above (syntax trees, bound trees, codegen settings), and will only be tasked with answering questions. Usable on its own to expose in different IDEs (same service for VSCode, IntelliJ, Vim, etc). Reusable to extend the functionality of other editor features (task runners, testing, deployment, CI, debugging).
5. Runtime observation APIs to support Rethnet.

All of this will be reusable to create entirely new EVM programming languages, since by replacing the parser and type system, one can get an entire high-quality toolchain working from the get-go.

**Rethnet**

To provide a simulated environment where developers can build and test their Ethereum software, tools need to replicate many of the components that make up a full Ethereum node implementation. This is a significant engineering effort, which given the complexity of Ethereum, represents a barrier to entry to tooling development given the depth of knowledge that is required.

Rethnet aims to make this easier by offering a native, flexible, extensible, fast, and language-agnostic EVM local development network, distributed as a Rust library, that is designed to be the underlying core in tools that provide debugging information to developers (like Hardhat, Foundry, Remix, Truffle, DappTools, etc). It will be a Rust library made to be consumed from other languages like TypeScript, Go, Python, etc as a native dependency. It will implement the baseline of essential functionality every tool should have like Solidity console.log, stack traces, and descriptive error messages, as well as implement code coverage, gas profiling, and a step debugger. At its core, it's an implementation of an Ethereum node with a layer of EVM runtime observation to provide development features.

Building a new Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, or DappTools using Rethnet will be a much more manageable project, and Rethnet will be completely reusable for any EVM language through adapters.

### **Hardhat**

Our flagship project targets the local development environment pillar, and it's currently at an advanced level of progress and adoption. While Slang and Rethnet mature and catalyze organic growth in the tooling space, developers still have needs to be met, positioning Hardhat as our immediate-term solution to empower developers to keep decentralizing the world.

Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment that developers use to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. Most importantly, it's highly flexible, extensible, and designed to empower the community to build their own solutions. This strategy has been successful, and there's already [a valuable ecosystem of reusable plugins](https://hardhat.org/plugins/).

Hardhat's roadmap is focused on becoming an extensible development environment with deep integrations across components in key areas of the tooling stack:

- [Hardhat VSCode](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/hardhat-vscode-9de29467fc26) — programming editor
- [Hardhat Ignition](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/hardhat-ignition-5a34a4e3d2de) — contract deployment
- [Hardhat Network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/) — local development network
- [Hardhat Runner](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview) — build/testing workflow

This roadmap leads to developers being well equipped to build powerful extensions to their workflow that increase their productivity according to their exact needs, and to then share them with the ecosystem in the form of plugins.

Hardhat will also eventually migrate to using Rethnet and Slang, increasing its feature richness, speed, and stability while enabling dogfooding at scale for our brand new building blocks.

### **Web3.js as a frontend platform**

The OG Ethereum connector library, Web3.js, is being revitalized into a high-value project. By focusing on community and ecosystem growth, supported by an extensible architecture, it can become a great source of value, much like React represents in the front-end world, but for dapps. A website hub connecting community spaces, support spaces, educational resources, extensions, and related projects, combined with an active ecodev effort (workshops, talks, contests, and incentives), will create a source of leverage for the ecosystem. This will provide better troubleshooting, faster developer training, more reusable code, and, most importantly, the possibility of extending the library. This effort is currently spearheaded by the ChainSafe team.

## **Funding**

The Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we’re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.

The Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we're aiming to raise $15M more.

## **Why Uniswap?**

Generally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we've approached and will continue approaching several protocols.

Currently, Uniswap [is built using Hardhat](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts). While this is a signal of Hardhat’s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We’ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:

1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).
2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.
3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.
4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.
5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.

We believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we’d love to have the **Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort**.",bearish
63,"Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave v3 MVP deployment on Scroll mainnet

Author: Lea - Partnerships Lead at @Scroll_zkEVM

Date: 2023-05-30

----

### Simple Summary:

Proposal to deploy an Aave v3 MVP to Scroll mainnet with limited assets onboarding and conservative risk parameters in order to allow Aave to establish a strategic position in the Scroll ecosystem while limiting risk exposure.

### Background:

This Temp Check proposes the deployment of a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) version of Aave V3 on Scroll mainnet. Scroll mainnet will go live beginning of August this year and intends to onboard Aave V3 as one of the first DeFi dApps in the eocsystem. Scroll is an EVM-equivalent zk-rollup with the primary goal to provide scalability to Ethereum in the most robust and secure way. We guarantee this by being open source from day 1, a strong in-house security team paired with rigorous audits, third party provers upon our mainnet genesis block and a gradual decentralization of our sequencer network.

### Motivation:
Aave will be given a prominent role in the early Scroll ecosystem and will be able to establish a strategic presence early on. Aave will be in good company of 150+ projects going live shortly after mainnet launch and will be able to harness a vibrant new ecosystem that expands across the globe.

### Specification:
The proposal will detail the deployment of Aave V3 on Scroll mainnet with three collaterals (WETH, USDC, wstETH) and one borrowable asset (USDC). We consulted Gauntlet and Chaos Labs for preliminary risk parameters and if this proposal is to pass, we will get further input on risk parameters for the listed assets at the ARFC phase.

| Risk Parameter |WETH|wstETH|USDC|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO |
| Enable Borrow | YES | NO | YES |
| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES |
| Emode Category | eth-correlated | eth-correlated | N/A |
| Loan To Value | 80% | 80%  | 82.5% |
| Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 82.5% | 85% |
| Liquidation Bonus | 5% | 5% | 5% |
| Reserve Factor | 15% | 15% | 10% |
| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% |
| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| uOptimal | 80% | 45% | 90% |
| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Slope1 | 4.8% | 4.8% | 4% |
| Slope2 | 80% | 80% | 60% |

To limit risk exposure to the DAO, we commit 500,000 USD in $AAVE staked to the Aave Safety Module to provide additional security guarantees.

### Disclaimer
We consulted both @Gauntlet and @ChaosLabs for this MVP proposal. The information provided above about preliminary risk parameters is based on public sources and previous comparable parameter proposals. It cannot be guaranteed that it is or will stay accurate. Neither Gauntlet nor Chaos Labs have been compensated by Scroll.

This TempCheck has been prepared to gauge initial feedback from the community and promote further discussion. The presented risk parameters will be finalized in the ARFC phase pending a positive outcome of the Temperature Check Snapshot

### Next Steps
**Temperature Check:** Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Scroll mainnet.

**ARFC:** If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.

**AIP:** If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.

66,"Summary
Transak was previously integrated with Aave UI(Fiat → aTokens on Aave). The purpose of this proposal is to add it to allow users in over 100+ countries across multiple blockchain networks to buy cryptocurrencies in order to get a yield-earning token in their wallets.

Details -
Background
Transak was on Aave UI. Since Aave migration has happened to IPFS, Transak proposed to be added back on Aave to enable the community to on-ramp on all the networks where Aave v3 is currently deployed.

About Transak
Transak is a single integration for applications to enable fiat-to-crypto on-ramp for a global user base. It does this by providing API-driven fiat payment methods to the on-ramp to 100+ crypto assets and abstracting away the complexity of user KYC, risk monitoring & compliance, payment methods, and customer support.

Goal
To integrate Transak Widget into Aave UI so that users can buy CryptoCurrencies against Fiat currencies using different payment methods on multiple blockchain networks.

The Problem
Unfortunately, to start earning interest on tokens or borrowing funds, users have to obtain their cryptocurrencies beforehand in order to interact with Aave. A user would have to go through as many as three steps before reaching Aave.


![image](ipfs://QmamKu8f4GVDCSmpUwWXV9qBfcFkD8P2TGFDG5sbTLAqpY)

Solution & Benefit to the Aave Community
Allow Aave users to deposit more than 100+ cryptocurrencies with credit/debit card, Apple Pay, bank transfer, or the local payment method in more than 100+ countries and get yield-earning tokens in your wallet in 1 step with only 0.5% commission for bank transfer payments extremely competitively priced.
Transak supports all the networks where Aave v3 is currently deployed and enables Aave users to access a supported DeFi in 1 step through Transak’s 1-click to protocol solution. Now users only need to enter their wallet address and pay through their preferred payment method to use AAVE. Transak’s 1-click to protocol solution hides the blockchain complexity and combines all five transactions into just one step for the user.


![image](ipfs://QmfH9a1SoPBUhYcccrvw8puVpqrP7KeJ8Kn56Z2ViX25xy)

How it Works
Using this integration, the user clicks on the buy Token button on the AAVE website to launch Transak Widget. Transak has its own smart contracts and when users deposit fiat it automatically mints yield-earning tokens and delivers them directly to their wallet. Transak takes all the complexity of what’s going on and makes it simple for the user — fiat in requested cryptocurrency out to the user’s wallet.

### PR with Payload
https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/637

## TL;DR

More than six months after [BIP-216](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-216-add-permissions-for-batch-relayer-v5-second-attempt/4534) (batch relayer v5), the last day of October saw the deployment of the newest batch relayer: v6 ([changelog](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-216-add-permissions-for-batch-relayer-v5-second-attempt/4534)).

This BIP proposes to give it the necessary permissions on all chains it was deployed on, except for BSC and the testnets.

title: [ARFC] USDT Risk Parameters Update Aave V3 ETH Pool
author: Marc Zeller, Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
date: 2023-06-06
---

## Abstract

This ARFC proposes an update to the risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, enabling it as collateral.

## Motivation

This proposal aims to unlock the potential of USDT as collateral within the Aave ETH V3 pool. By aligning the risk parameters of USDT with those of USDC, we anticipate an increase in borrowing power for users. This change is expected to stimulate borrowing volume on Aave, thereby contributing to the protocol's revenue. The activation of collateral power for USDT is a strategic move towards creating a more dynamic, efficient, and profitable liquidity environment within the Aave ETH V3 pool.

## Specification

The following table outlines the proposed risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, which will replicate the risk parameters of USDC:

| Parameter | Current Value (USDT) | Proposed Value (USDT) | Current Value (USDC) |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| LTV       | 0%                   | 74%                  | 74%                  |
| LT        | 0%                   | 76%                  | 76%                  |
| LB        | 0%                   | 4.5%                 | 4.5%                 |

## Next Steps

- If the ARFC Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) stage for final approval.

73,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

title: ARC: Extend the Safety Module Protection to Aave V2 Polygon
status: WIP
author: Governance House, @MatthewGraham @ncitron, 3SE Holding & uhom 
created: 25/07/2022

---

# Simple Summary

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module (SM) protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested.

# Abstract

The Safety Module is a $700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users. It’s a unique mechanism within DeFi, that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users. At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market. As a result, not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection.

As new markets hold more risk at launch, they are initially excluded from the SM protection. Today, most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO, they seem fit for SM protection.

# Motivation

The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi. This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market. As new markets hold additional risk, these are not initially protected by the SM. However, once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months, the risks are significantly lower. Furthermore, the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process, with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2.

Overall, these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market, holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market. This implies that, in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market, the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market. Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks, as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers.

Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers (lps) on these markets. By reducing the risk for lps, it is expected to lead to further growth of the market’s TVL overtime. Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets, lps are treated more equally across the markets.

The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets. In the case of Aave markets on other chains, the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure, and not failures caused by the chains themselves (Polygon/Avax). With regards to the Aave Arc Market, Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAO’s stated risk parameters, should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update, the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance.

These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem. In particular, the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive. Today, most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon, while just about 100k on Ethereum V2. These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections, in a shorter time period.

## Summary:

This proposal seeks a Balancer Gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC pool on Base, with uncapped emissions. The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.

The underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.

## Protocol Description:

Savings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.

sDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.

To acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).

## Motivation:

Spark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.

## Specifications:

Savings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.

**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).

**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).

**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.

**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.

**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).

**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.

76,"**Summary:**

A proposal by the Mechanism.Capital 13 team to create a Curve Metapool for Empty Set Dollar (ESD) and the 3Pool stablecoins (USDC, USDT, and DAI).

ESD has been one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins launched to date. Its market capitalization has grown to over $65 million in the ~2 months since its inception (peaked near $100 million).

The unique mechanism design of the protocol makes it a strong candidate to become one of the largest stable collateral assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

Creating an ESD metapool would attract more liquidity to the Curve platform and lead to increased trading fees.

Learn more about metapools here: https://resources.curve.fi/faq/base-and-metapools 1

**Abstract:**

Empty Set Dollar (ESD) is a new algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin that utilizes fixed protocol rules on supply expansion as well as a unique coupon creation + redemption model to incentivize trustless coordination between selfish participants that maintain ESD’s synthetic peg 1:1 with the US dollar all on-chain. Unlike other algorithmic stable coins like AMPL, ESD does not rebase all balances using non-standard functions, but instead adjusts supply through other mechanisms, allowing ESD to have the same composability as other standard ERC20 tokens.

Currently, crypto lacks a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoin. While DAI and sUSD come close, they currently have vulnerabilities in their architecture. The goal of ESD is to create a truly permissionless, scaleable, stable store of value, that can be used as superfluid collateral in DeFi.

Note: ESD currently only incentivizes the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool. In order to motivate more liquidity to flow to this Curve metapool, ESD holders would have to vote to upgrade ESD to incentivize this new pool. However, various ESD community members have already expressed their support for such a prospective proposal to reward Curve LPs.

*Liquidity:*

Total Uniswap Liquidity as of 11/3/2020: $1.52 million

Avg. Daily Trading Volume (Last 14 Days ended 11/3/2020): $3.75 million

*Token Holder Distribution:*

As of 11/4/2020 there are currently over 853 unique addresses holding ESD. This includes 668 staked addresses.

Over 90% of ESD tokens were staked to the DAO as of 11/3/2020.

**Motivation:**

This is an opportunity for Curve to attract more liquidity to its platform and increase trading fees. It would also benefit the ESD community by increasing the efficiency of ESD turnover and accelerating ESD contraction & expansion cycles to further stabilize the price of the token around $1. Finally, accelerating the growth of ESD would enhance the antifragility of the entire DeFi ecosystem due to ESD’s unique characteristics relative to other stable assets.

**Specification:**

This metapool would include ESD, USDC, USDT, and DAI. It is likely that the ESD protocol community would vote to incentivize this Curve metapool. It already does this for the ESD/USDC pool on Uniswap: https://emptyset.finance/#/pool/

**For:**

This pool would bring more liquidity and fees to the Curve protocol.

It would also help accelerate and dampen the volatility ESD’s expansion/contraction cycles, which are currently delayed due to the limitations of slippage on the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool.

Successful passage of this proposal would show the Curve community’s willingness to support new, innovative protocols – specifically those focused on open and permissionless access to DeFi.

**Against:**

ESD is a relatively new and experimental protocol. There are both known and unknown risks to explore as the protocol matures. These include, but are not limited to:

ESD is expected to trade within a narrow band around US$1.00, but has experienced short periods of significant volatility

A downward spiral in the instance of zero demand for new coupons (though in the current contraction period, over 26m coupons have been purchased)

Smart contract bugs (code is currently under audit); and

A design flaw that leads to an economic attack (see the recent Harvest Finance attack 1).

Since its inception in 2020, the community-driven Venus Protocol has successfully offered an autonomous and non-custodial utility for supplying liquidity and collateralization of digital assets. In that time, community feedback and data analysis have charted a path toward improving the protocol’s performance.

After 2 years of remarkable growth in which Venus became the most transacted protocol on BNB Chain in its category, this proposal needs community approval for upgrading the protocol across numerous areas as outlined below.

We’re pleased to present Venus V4, the next generation of features to advance DeFi. In particular, Venus V4 improvements address three key areas: risk management, decentralization, and user experience.

Main Upgrades to be performed: 

- Isolated Markets Integration
- Stable Rate Borrowing
- DEX Integration
- New Risk Management
- VAI Stability Fee
- Updated Governance Process
- Tokenomics V3
- Venus Bonds to cover shortfall

78,"Hello, don't waste your time making dump proposal to drain the coin, make something to increase the calue of the protocol. 

The idea is, reward with some progressive percentage to someone who holds CAKE and provide liquidity for pools or farm.

Who holds CAKE gets rewarded with extra percentage on the profit of the liquidity pools.

Here we add value and usage for the coin and a exponencial percentage to who make the liquidity and holds CAKE at same time.

The increase of the demand will appear just in the beginning of this idea, and forces market makers to holds the coin for more profit in the swap of the liquidity pools. 

This will generate something really useful for the token.

80,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-increase-aave-captier-from-cap3-to-cap4-10m-30m/924).

This is a proposal to raise the liquidity mining cap from $10M to $30M for $AAVE

# The Proposal

After the activation of the Balancer Based Safety Module yesterday, the liquidity for $AAVE quickly crossed the 30M mark as new LPs join the AAVE/BAL incentivized Safety Module. Current APY by staking in the Safety Module is 350%, only considering the AAVE rewards, which will presumably attract a lot of liquidity, making Balancer the best protocol to trade AAVE on chain.

# What is The Safety Module?

The Aave Safety Module acts as a collateral for the whole Aave ecosystem. AAVE holders, and now - with the new Balancer Based Stake - AAVE/ETH holders benefit from long term rewards for securing the protocol from insolvency, while at the same time bearing the risk of being slashed in case of shortfall events. 
Having a very liquid onchain market and a consistent capital allocated in the Safety Module greatly increases the safety of the Aave ecosystem and the Aave protocol liquidity providers.",bearish

83,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.


## Specification

This past week did not see outsized changes in market conditions nor within the Aave protocol. There were slight volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets. Our platform recommends the following set of parameter changes that will decrease liquidation bonuses on several less-utilized assets.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAL Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |
| DPI Loan To Value     | 65%     | 70%     |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| DPI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |
| ENJ Loan To Value    | 60%     | 70%     |
| MANA Loan To Value    | 65%     | 70%     |
| MKR Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| UNI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |

title: [ARFC] Aave Robot v1
author: @bgdlabs - BGD Labs (Bored Ghosts Developing)
created: 2023-06-28
---

## Summary

Request approval from the community to move forward Aave Robot v1, the first iteration of a framework and architecture of smart contracts to automate permissionless actions of Aave, like those related to the Aave governance v2; powered by Chainlink Automation.

## How will it work?

A detailed description of the system can be found on the [Aave governance forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-robot-v1/13091), but as summary:
- Multiple `Robot` smart contracts will be deployed, that will contain the logic to 1) understand when a permissionless action on Governance v2 (or cross-chain governance) can be triggered (queueing, execution, cancel) and 2) execute them.
- A `AaveCLRobotOperator` will be deployed on each network, that will allow for the DAO to have ""admin"" control on all the underlying robots, in order to register new ones, cancel or funding them with the LINK required for execution.
- To simplify operational complexity, the maximum gas limit proposed will be close to the maximum allowed by the underlying Chainlink infrastructure. As anybody can top-up LINK on the Aave Robot via a permissionless function on the `AaveCLRobotOperator`, the community could request for external entities to partially or totally cover the execution costs of proposals by using it.
- As in some cases it could be desirable for example to disable automation of a specific proposal and this is not possible with ""slow"" governance procedures, a Robot Guardian role is defined that will be able to 1) disable automation for a certain governance proposal and 2) ""pause"" automation on a specific network.
Both actions are non-invasive, as it only affects the automation system, not the underlying governance system at all.
Initially, BGD will keep the Robot Guardian role.

### Setup flow

For the DAO to activate the system the procedure is simply the following:
1. A technical service provider (BGD in this case) will deploy both the Robot smart contracts and the `AaveCLRobotOperator`, on each supported network.
2. A governance proposal will be submitted to activate and configured those robots, and top them up with LINK from the Aave Collector.

Afterwards, the DAO can register new robots via governance proposal, or manage the registered ones however needed.",bullish
86,"#### Angle Protocol - Farms Optimization

Dear CAKE holders, to improve trading conditions and CAKE buyback, we are optimizing CAKE emission to the current Angle Protocol farm - agEUR-USDT on BNB Chain.

By redirecting CAKE from underperforming to high-performing Angle Protocol farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This ensures CAKE is distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner for CAKE holders.**

#### The Farm:

| Farm          | Previous Multiplier | New Multiplier | Change |
|:--------------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| agEUR-USDT | 1.5x | 3.0x | +1.5x |

We propose to increase the farm multiplier of agEUR-USDT (0.05%) to **3.0x CAKE rewards**. This will be executed shortly after the end of the vote proposal, if it passes.

If the TVL in the Farm picks up, we ask for discretion to increase the farm multiplier appropriately, up to a maximum of 5.0x. The duration and multipliers of the farm may be adjusted to optimize CAKE emissions.


#### ⚠️⚠️⚠️BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING⚠️⚠️⚠️💀

CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from **Highstreet**. Highstreet is a commerce-centered metaverse that incorporates shopping, gaming, NFTs, traditional and crypto brands in a massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).  Highstreet builds a gaming layer on top of preexisting e-commerce infrastructure to transform merchants from a physical model to phygital model.

#### What is Boost?

Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, the HIGH-BUSD farm will go to a 1x multiple for 48 hours, then 0.5x thereafter. 

At the end of the Syrup Pool period (approx. 1200 UTC on 25 Sep 2022), the team will review the average volume of the HIGH-BUSD farm and adjust the multiplier accordingly.   

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the boosted period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.
 
At the same time, there will be a delicious, new HIGH Syrup Pool with 230,300 HIGH tokens to be earned by staking CAKE. Get your CAKE ready!


#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn HIGH tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 230,300 HIGH
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 27 Jul 2022
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 25 Sep 2022
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.1332 HIGH

#### Max Stake per wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### What is $HIGH?

From the team: “Highstreet is a decentralized metaverse where brands - both traditional and crypto, can use their Merchant Portal to seamlessly integrate and build their presence in Highstreet World.

HIGH is Highstreet's native token which provides holders with in-game access for game progression and access to special events, serves as an in-game currency, and can be used for on-chain governance.”

title: [ARFC] GHO - Increase Borrow Rate
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & ACI - @MarcZeller
created: 2023-10-30

---

# Summary

This publication proposes increasing the GHO Borrow Rate from 3.00% to 4.72%, the proposed sDAI rate.

# Motivation

Over the past week, the GHO peg has been gradually declining, while the supply has been increasing. Users have been minting GHO and subsequently exchanging it for other assets.

Incremental interest rate hikes have not had the desired effect, evident by GHO price continuing to trade lower. The GHO borrowing rate remains significantly lower compared to other stablecoins.

This publication suggests aligning the GHO borrowing rate with the proposed sDAI rate, 4.72%. The aim is to reduce the borrowing discount of GHO relative to other stablecoins before returning to periodic 50bps increases.

The chart below shows the general GHO price downwards trend. 

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByIPGWaz6.png)

The below shows the borrow rate of GHO relative to other stable coins. 

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryZgQWazp.png)

The main types of collateral backing GHO are wstETH (29.68%), wETH (28.84%), wBTC (20.44%) and rETH (8.94%). For reference, sDAI makes up 2.07% of the collateral supporting GHO debt with a current APR of [5.0%](https://daistats.com/#/ecosystem) which is expected to adjust lower to 4.72%. A large portion of the collateral backing GHO is generating yield which acts to offset borrowing costs.

By increasing the borrow rate to 4.72%, the goal is to improve the peg by reducing the incentive to mint GHO relative to other stable coins. As a result, GHO's growth is expected to slow. This publication prioritises returning GHO to peg over growth. 

After implementing this proposal, the community can continue with the current plan, [direct-to-AIP process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/349/).

Bringing Curve to Celo means enabling millions of people to gain access to more DeFi tools, and helps further Celo’s goal of bringing prosperity to all.

Through the $100M DeFi for the People initiative, the Celo Foundation will provide $7M of incentives in CELO tokens to bring sustainable liquidity to Curve. Stablecoins on Celo will be listed on Curve to provide opportunities for CRV holders to earn trading fees. Additionally, we propose that the Curve community also provides CRV tokens as incentives.

Celo features 2.6M addresses, up to 1.1M daily transaction, and has processed 102M total transactions. Current native stablecoins include cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL with plans to launch several more this year. These are in addition to bridged versions of DAI, USDC, and USDT using multiple bridge instances. DeFi TVL on Celo has reached as high as approximately $1.2B prior to recent market corrections. Additionally, Celo has been chosen by Kickstarter for its upcoming decentralized product (to date, Kickstarter has successfully supported over 214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers) which will attract new users to the ecosystem.

Motivation:

Curve is building the multi-chain future of DeFi. The Celo ecosystem presents a strong partnership due to its global user base, native stablecoin assets, and EVM compatibility. Current multichain DeFi protocols on Celo include Sushi, 0x, Beefy and Pooltogether, which are joined by native protocols such as Moola Market, Ubeswap, and Mobius.

The Celo platform is fully EVM compatible with a few notable improvements:

- Celo has a fast and secure PoS consensus protocol that aggregates validator signatures using the SNARK-friendly BLS12-377 curve. This choice enables mobile friendly SNARK-based light clients such as Plumo, as well as SNARK proofs that can prove asset ownership off-chain.
- Gas can be paid with CELO or ERC20 tokens (that have been whitelisted through Celo’s on-chain governance). This would make it possible for Curve users to pay for transactions with stablecoins (e.g. cUSD or cEUR) enabling a great user experience for novice users.
- The CELO asset supports the ERC20 interface natively, which does away with the need for a wrapped counterpart like WCELO.
- The network includes a decentralized phone verification protocol that can be used by dApps for lightweight sybil resistance and to make it easier for wallets to use hashed phone numbers as identifiers in an interoperable manner. See this in action with Valora.
- The network includes a few stablecoins that have been whitelisted as a gas currency (cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL). These stablecoins are fully algorithmic, with a smart-contract based expansion and contraction platform (called Mento) that is backed by the Celo Reserve. Mento algorithmically adjusts the supply of stablecoins to user demand. The reserve is overcollateralized and currently consists of over $540M in holdings made up by 103.3M CELO, 3.3K BTC, 35.0K ETH, 15.4M DAI, and 83.3K cMCO2.

Specification:

cLabs will work with the Curve team to deploy all necessary smart contracts needed to start Curve pools and provide any additional tooling necessary to manage incentives for the Curve community, as well as work with third party vendors to perform smart contract audits. cLabs will also work to ensure that cross chain bridge options are available for swapping CRV tokens to and from Celo to networks where Curve is present. Celo is EVM compatible and so the deployment is expected to be completed with little to no alterations to the smart contracts.

For:

Curve will add new users from the Celo community and enable millions of people to gain access to DeFi tools through their mobile phone. This in turn will promote Celo’s goal of bringing DeFi to everyday people by driving more liquidity into the Celo ecosystem thereby making DeFi more accessible.

Against:

Not enough interest in the Curve community to deploy and maintain on Celo. Celo’s goal for making DeFi to people through mobile phones does not fit within Curve’s goals.

96,"The objective of this proposal is to share ideas on how we can do the following. 

1. Increase rewards for farmers
2. Increase the utility of staked CAKE
3. Increase the protocol revenue 
4. Reduce CAKE emissions
5. Get closer to ultrasound money

Every few weeks we vote to change the rewards for each farm, reducing some and increaing others.  This method should be scraped and replaced with a ""ve"" type voting gauge. 

Staked CAKE holders could then vote on how the CAKE rewards should be split between the farms. 
If a farm get 5% of the vote then they get 5% of the CAKE rewards. 

Once a vote deadline has been hit, them reward amounts are locked in for 2 weeks and then votes are recounted every 2 weeks. 

On top of the Gauge voting system we build a UI for bribes, where farmers and 3rd party protocols can offer a payment to staked CAKE holders in exchange for their votes. 

As the bribe UI builds up and the bribes start coming in, we can start reducing the CAKE emissions being paid to the staked CAKE holders.  Replacing CAKE emissions with income from other protocols. 
The reduction of emissions to the staked CAKE pool should be at a slow and steady rate of 1 CAKE per block per month until the rewards are 0 CAKE emissions. 

After the first reduction in emissions to the staked CAKE pool the protocol will redirect 5% of the trading fees (from the 0.01% and 0.05% farms) to rewarding the staked CAKE pool.  

To kickstart the system the rewards to farmers should be increased by 0.25 CAKE per block per month over a 6 month time frame, increasing the emissions by 1.5 CAKE per block.  Once the ecosystem is up and running we can look at reducing these emissions. 



The expected outcome.

1. Emissions reduced by 0.75 CAKE per block a month with a total reduction of 5.15 CAKE per block after 7 months. a 55% reduction in emissions. 
2. Staked CAKE holders rewards switch from emissions to bribes + trading fees, avoiding a massive overnight cut in rewards. 
3. Farmers see an steady increase in the overall rewards allocated to farming. 
4. 3rd party protocols have the option to buy voting power with bribes, which should increase the liquidity in their farms. 
5. 3rd party protocols now have a reason to buy and hold staked CAKE so they can vote for their own liquidity pools. 
6. Staked CAKE voting power has an increased value,",bearish

### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard dlcBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum and Arbitrum 
### Author: Aki Balogh & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
###  Date: 2024-06-24

---

### **Simple Summary:**

Proposal to onboard dlcBTC to Aave v3 on the Ethereum and Arbitrum pools.

### **Motivation/Background:**

dlcBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum, enabling Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi protocols while retaining full ownership of their assets. It leverages Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) for secure cross-chain transactions, ensuring trustless and decentralized asset management. dlcBTC is minted by a decentralized set of merchants who lock BTC with themselves (a process we call ""self-wrapping""), ensuring self-custody and reducing central points of failure.

Unlike other bridges, dlcBTC merchants ""self-wrap"" Bitcoin, meaning funds are never sent to an external address, reducing the risk of theft or loss. dlcBTC has a Chainlink proof of reserve feed. See [https://data.chain.link/feeds/arbitrum/mainnet/dlcbtc-por](https://data.chain.link/feeds/arbitrum/mainnet/dlcbtc-por).

**Benefits of listing that token:**

Listing dlcBTC will enable Bitcoin holders to use their assets as collateral within Aave, increasing liquidity and user engagement on the platform. It will attract a broader user base from the Bitcoin community and enhance the diversity of collateral options within Aave. Additionally, it supports DeFi platforms such as Nektar and Swaap, which can generate staking yield using dlcBTC.

**Market Impact:**

Including dlcBTC will positively impact Aave’s liquidity and user adoption, leveraging Bitcoin’s status as the largest digital asset by market cap and its global brand recognition. The secure and decentralized nature of dlcBTC will contribute to the platform’s growth and stability, enhancing security for users and expanding the overall market reach of Aave. While wBTC has seen great success, its reliance on a single custodian introduces significant counterparty risk. dlcBTC addresses this by decentralizing the merchant set, substantially reducing the potential for counterparty failures.

**Chain to be deployed/listed:**

Ethereum, Arbitrum

**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:**

* Use dlcBTC as collateral within Aave, enhancing liquidity options
* Commitments from the federated set of merchants to ensure “self-wrapped” Bitcoin deposits, visible at the https://mint.dlc.link/proof-of-reserve. Merchants in the process of onboarding include Amber Group, IMC, HashKey and Time Research
* Integration into DeFi platforms such as Nektar, Swaap and Archimedes to generate yield using dlcBTC
* As an exclusive offer to Aave users:
  * Earn 6X points when you use dlcBTC as borrow collateral on Aave
  * Earn 8X points when you deposit dlcBTC and mint GHO
  * Note: Health Factor of the position must be between 1.5 and 3 to qualify for this offer

title: [Proposal] Whitelist the Aave Mainnet Reserve Factor for Balancer’s VoteEscrow
status: Proposed
author: @Matthew_Graham (Llama)
created: 23-04-2022

---

# Summary

The proposal aims to add Aave DAO’s Reserve Factor address to the Balancer VotingEscrow whitelist. This will enable the Aave Community to vote-lock BAL (B-80BAL-20WETH) and participate in Balancer DAO’s governance, [1].

# Abstract

Llama has published proposals on the Aave DAO and Balancer DAO governance forum for both communities to perform a 200,000 BAL for AAVE tokenswap, [2,3,4]. Upon completing this tokenswap, Aave intends to deposit BAL and ETH into the B-80BAL-20WETH pool. This proposal is to enable Aave to vote-lock BAL (B-80/20 BAL/ETH) and become an active contributor within the Balancer governance process.

# Motivation

Aave and Balancer communities have a long working relationship. Aave has incorporated the 80/20 AAVE/ETH Balancer V1 BPT into the Safety Module and intends to upgrade to using a Balancer V2 pool in time. Meanwhile, Balancer’s USDC/DAI/USDT Boosted Pool uses Aave V2 in the background as a source of yield for liquidity providers. Both communities have demonstrated the ability to work together and create value for each other’s community. The tokenswap is the next logical step in creating an ever stronger relationship.

At the time of writing the Aave mainnet Reserve Factor holds 1,924 aBAL and this will become around 201,924 BAL post tokenswap, [2,5]. If the Aave community elects to proceed with an on-market purchase of 100,000 BAL, the total BAL holding will become 301,924 and Aave will become one of the Top 30 holders [6,7]. Aave intends to use the veBAL holding to actively participate in Balancer’s governance process and to support the pools that lead to funds being deposited into Aave markets and/or Safety Module.

# Risks

No significant risks have been identified in connection with the proposed transaction.

# Specification

Whitelist `0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c` to interact with the veBAL contract, [5].

This is a proposal to raise the liquidity mining cap from $100M to uncapped for $AAVE

# The Proposal

After the activation of the Balancer Based Safety Module 20 Days ago, the liquidity for $AAVE quickly grew to be the Largest Balancer protocol Liquidity Pool as new LPs join the AAVE/BAL incentivized Safety Module.

![image|690x101](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/464af158056f0a77cbf50195bfc2bb8a987826c1.png) 

Current APY by staking in the Safety Module is 29.34%, only considering the AAVE rewards, The Pool is still growing and Balancer is now the best protocol to swap AAVE onchain.

As BAL is a collateral option in Aave, aBPT stakers can use their BAL rewards to unlock more borrowing power in the Aave Protocol.

Uncapping the BAL rewards for the AAVE/ETH pool will allows even further incentive to bring more liquidity onchain and increase the synergies between the Aave & Balancer protocols.

# What is The Safety Module?

The Aave Safety Module acts as a collateral for the whole Aave ecosystem. AAVE holders, and now - with the new Balancer Based Stake - AAVE/ETH holders benefit from long term rewards for securing the protocol from insolvency, while at the same time bearing the risk of being slashed in case of shortfall events.
Having a very liquid onchain market and a consistent capital allocated in the Safety Module greatly increases the safety of the Aave ecosystem and the Aave protocol liquidity providers.",bullish
101,"Main purpose of this proposal is to allow users to unlock the CAKE in emergency, reduce the CAKE circulating and reduce the MAX CAKE supply in long term. 

This will give users more confidence as they can unstake CAKE with penalty and they won’t miss out opportunity to cash out if CAKE price increases.

We should allow users to unlock CAKE before unlock date at penalty of 20% and 20% of penalty will be directly sent for burning and the amount is reduced from 750M max supply. This will slowly reduce the max supply and circulating supply and allow users to unlock their CAKE in emergency.

This will bring more users to staking and reduce the CAKE supply in long term.



**Example : 
**
If I have 1000 cake in locked staking, I can unlock CAKE any time and I will get 800 CAKE back and 200 CAKE will be sent to burn address and MAX CAKE supply will be reduced to 
750,000,000 – 200 = 749,999,800",bullish
102,And why?,neutral
103,"# Overview

This is a proposal to provide Balancer DAO with an automated way to collect the fees that the protocol has earned from its different layers, convert and bridge them if needed. Therefore, later on, an authorized party can withdraw and distribute them as bribes, to the DAO and to veBAL holders. The goal is to ensure that protocol fee collecting process is fully trustless and automated.

# 1. About Mimic

Mimic is a platform that allows you to deploy tailored infrastructure to automate (and/or delegate) access to DeFi, in a secure and 100% non-custodial way. Mimic is especially suitable to replace and speed up manual and centralized tasks while tracking and monitoring every detail. This is achieved through our innovative **Smart Vaults** concept: an automated and trustless solution that can be customized to suit your operation needs.

Deploying a Smart Vault is simple. We only need to figure out the best configuration that suits your needs and customize one for you. Moreover, Mimic provides you with lots of multi-layer flexibility, it can be easily scaled up by deploying and connecting additional Smart Vaults.

 
![smartValut.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreigf4kq2llrgqfetotcgcojmfigz646vhumbiox6sa7g6tesj6obly)
    

Our team members have a large experience in blockchain and especially in DeFi protocols. We have previously worked for many well-known projects like Aave, Balancer, Open Zeppelin, Aragon, POAP and The Graph.

# 2. Background

Currently Balancer DAO collects protocol fees in three layers: Mainnet, Polygon and Arbitrum:

Mainnet: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F

Polygon: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F

Arbitrum: 0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F

As documented in [[BIP-19] Incentivize Core Pools & L2 Usage](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329):

- All fees earned on Polygon & Arbitrum are used as bribes for core pools on those networks, weighted proportionally by TVL of those core pools - after the DAO takes its 25%.
- All fees earned by Ethereum core pools are used as bribes on those pools (each pool gets its own fees as a bribe), after the DAO takes its 25%.
- All fees earned by Ethereum non-core pools are sent to veBAL and the DAO (75/25 split).
- Protocol fee collection, distribution, and any subsequent bribing take place every two weeks on Monday instead of weekly on Wednesday.
- All fees earned are converted to USDC, except BAL and BAL-like assets which are converted to BAL
- All bribes are paid in USDC

# 3. Core Proposal

Our proposal is to provide Balancer DAO with a **solution to automate** how it collects and distributes its protocol fees. To accomplished this, Mimic will deploy three customized Smart Vaults owned by Balancer DAO, one on each layer.

All Smart Vaults will only be allowed to collect earned fees when they reach a pre-determined value in USDC. If fees collected are BAL-like assets they will be converted to BAL, otherwise they will be converted to USDC. Both Polygon and Arbitrum Smart Vaults will bridge all USDC and BAL accumulated to the Mainnet Smart Vault every two weeks (one period).

Finally, an authorized manager can withdraw those collected tokens from Mainnet Smart Vault to distribute them accordingly as bribes, to the DAO and to veBAL holders.

Also, it is important to mention that at all times the DAO has full ownership and control of all three Smart Vault’s assets. This means that, for example, at any moment it can remove permissions to execute an action or withdraw any asset by itself.

# 4. Technical Specification

There will be three Smart Vaults. One deployed in Mainnet, another in Polygon and the last one in Arbitrum. All Smart Vaults will have a single owner who has full control over them at all times. 

Each Smart Vault will be configured with a series of predefined actions, some of those will be automatically executed by Mimic network of bots and others manually by an authorized manager that Balancer DAO designates. Those actions are:

- **Gather and convert to USDC:** Gathers assets (expect from BAL and BAL-like assets) from Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector and swaps them to USDC (except from USDC itself).
- **Gather and convert to BAL:** Gathers BAL and BAL-like assets from Balancer ProtocolFeesCollector and swaps them to BAL (except from BAL itself).
- **Bridge:** Bridges USDC and BAL to Mainnet every two weeks.
- **Withdraw:** Withdraws any asset to an external wallet configured by the owner.

Note that all this behavior will be enforced by smart contracts code, actions won’t be allowed to perform any further logic.

In case external conditions change, the deployed infrastructure can be adjusted as necessary on an ongoing basis to reach the endowment’s objectives. Smart Vaults provide full flexibility to add new allow-listed actions, change permissions or incorporate new strategies. 

More information here: [https://docs.mimic.fi/general/how-it-works](https://docs.mimic.fi/general/how-it-works)

# 5. Operational details

## 5.1. Reporting

Mimic offers a reporting site where users can follow all their Smart Vaults activity. Mimic also supports subscribing to a notifications service that can be easily integrated with some chat rooms like Discord. Additionally, users can subscribe to be notified with periodic reports that will be emitted by Mimic automatically. 

## 5.2. Maintenance

Mimic will be in charge of monitoring the Smart Vaults on a daily basis, making sure the reporting tools are kept up-to-date accordingly. Additionally, Mimic will make use of its own bots infrastructure to execute the automated actions when needed. 

In case a critical report is received, Mimic will act immediately in order to assess its severity and act accordingly. In case Smart Vaults assets are at risk, Mimic team will get in touch with the trusted committee either to pause the Smart Vaults operations until it can be migrated to a new implementation with the corresponding fixes.

## 5.3. Fees

Mimic will charge a 2% fee of the assets that are processed through the Smart Vaults with a 5K USD cap for every period of execution (two weeks).

## 5.4. Termination

As mentioned before Balancer DAO will be in full control of its Smart Vaults and the funds that were deposited into them. This means Balancer DAO is allowed to exit at any point in time. Neither Mimic nor anyone else, unless it was previously allowed by the Balancer DAO, will be never in control of those funds.

# 6. Timeline

Once the final details of the Balancer Smart Vaults are finalized, the Mimic team will take full responsibility to set up the required automated actions. Mimic already counts with infrastructure to deploy and test Smart Vaults that can be applied for this use case.

Assuming the proposed investment strategies and automated actions are accepted by Balancer DAO, setting three Smart Vaults for it shouldn’t take longer than a month. After that, we will schedule an audit process for the configuration before the deployment which shouldn’t take more than two weeks.

title: Add DPI on Aave V2
status: WIP
author: Matthew Graham (@MatthewGraham)
shortDescription: Add DPI on Aave V2
discussions:  https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3576
created: 2021-07-19

## Simple Summary

Add DPI as collateral support for DPI to the Aave market. 

## Abstract

Add DPI to Aave V2 market.

The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) is a capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of decentralized financial assets across the market.

DPI is an ERC20 token that enables users to gain exposure to a basket of DeFi protocols via single transaction. The reduced volatility and broad diversification is a great property for collateral.

The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. DPI aims to track the projects in DeFi that have significant usage and show a commitment to ongoing maintenance and development. At the time of writing there are 14 tokens included in DPI. 

## Motivation

Aave would be the first major lending protocol to integrate an index product into its platform. DPI is becoming a DeFi standard and adding DPI would dramatically increase support for these efforts. 

There are over 12,000 DPI holders and growing. Adding DPI as collateral would bring users into the Aave ecosystem allowing capital, yield and value to accrue to Aave participants.

## Specification

DPI is a market capitalization weighted index product that follows a predetermined qualitative and quantitative methodology. The composition of the DPI portfolio is maintained by DeFi Pulse. 

The DPI token has no governance characteristics and is predominantly traded via the V2 Uniswap DPI-ETH pool. DPI is supported and maintained by Index Coop and is built on TokenSets infrastructure. 

At the time of writing, DPI has a market capitalization of greater than $220M and is the most readily traded DeFi index product.

There is an annual 95 basis point fee for holders of DPI that is split 70/30 between Index Coop and DeFi Pulse respectively. 

DPI-ETH earns INDEX rewards through liquidity mining, currently yielding upwards of 20% APR, in addition to around 5% in trading fee income with limited impermanent loss.

## Rationale

By purchasing DPI, users are able to gain exposure to leading DeFi protocols in the form of a single ERC20 token. The risk of holding just a select few protocols within a portfolio is diversified away, giving holders broad theme based exposure to DeFi.  

With Aave currently making up 20.88% of DPI, there is no better way for Aave to support DPI’s widespread adoption, than to enable DPI being utilized for borrowing and lending. With DPI trading since October 2020 and 90 day average trading volume of around $7.2M.

Additional information see Index Coop’s website: https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi

## Test Cases

Being a standard ERC20, the Aave protocol test cases already cover everything needed to support DPI. 

## Implementation

The implementations must be completed before any AIP is given status ""Implemented"", but it need not be completed before the AIP is ""Approved"". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of ""rough consensus and running code"" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

## DPI - Aave Risk Assessment 

Details can be found on the Aave governance forum post linked below.
https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3576/9

# Overal Risk Score: B-

The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) is an index product managed by Index Coop. At the time of writing there are 324,355 DPI in circulation. DPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions.

# DPI Smart Contract Risk: C-

DPI was audited by OpenZeppelin in September of 2020, launched early October 2020, and has over 111,000 user transactions.

# DPI Counterparty Risk: C

DPI is a product whereby holders of DPI have no metagovernance influence on Index Coop or the protocol within the index. DPI trades on the ethereum network and inherits the trust of the network much like USDC. DPI has over 12,055 holders and the DPI-ETH pool is Uniswap’s 17th largest at $90M. Anyone can Mint, Trade and Redeem DPI.

The DPI utilises TokenSets V2 smart contract has been audited by Open Zeppelin audit [September 4th, 2020] which identified privilege roles in many of the contracts. The key findings are highlighted below:

* The Controller contract has an owner that chooses the contracts that comprise the system. This includes all of the modules, resources and the factories that can be used to make Sets. 

* The IntegrationRegistry tracks third party integrations that can be used in the system. It also has an owner that can add, remove and edit the integrations as desired. 

* The PriceOracle has a list of oracles and adapters that can be used to retrieve third party prices. It also has an owner role that can choose the supported oracles, adapters and price pairs.

# DPI Market Risk: B-

DPI’s price tracks the Net Asset Value of the underlying assets, by holding a basket of protocol tokens the volatility of a single asset is dampened. This is reflected by DPI having a standard deviation of 5.75% since exception compared to ETH and AAVE which has a standard deviation of 5.03% and 7.79% respectively over the same time period (03/10/2021 to 01/05/2021). When considering liquidity, the average daily trading volume is $7.19M, based on over a trailing 90 day trading period. However, DPI holders have the option to mint/redeem the underlying tokens within DPI which draws on the liquidity of the underlying assets and also allows for any deviation from NAV to be arbitraged away by traders.

## Protocol Description:

Mellow LRT is an innovative liquid restaking primitive allowing permissionless creation of modular LRTs. Mellow offers a series of vault smart contracts tailored to different risk profiles, managed by LRT curators. For more information, please see [here](https://docs.mellow.finance/mellow-lrt-primitive/overview).

Mellow has more than 41,000 stETH worth of assets restaked across 4 LRTs curated by P2P (rstETH), Steakhouse (steakLRT), re7 (Re7LRT), and MEV Capital (amphrETH). The protocol quickly reached its cap limits after it launched in mid June 2024. In addition, it recently opened two Ethena related vaults (sUSDe and ENA) and generated an additional 37.5M sUSDe and 23.3M ENA.

## Motivation:

Mellow is seeking to establish the amphrETH/rstETH/Re7LRT/steakLRT/wstETH on Balancer to develop liquidity for its stETH backed LRTs. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Mellow community.

## Specifications:

1. Governance: Mellow currently operates with a multi-sig with [publicly](https://research.lido.fi/t/mellow-lido-alliance-proposal/7557/19) verified signers. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance as soon as required research and preparations are made.

2. Oracles: Mellow is working with RedStone to create price feeds for its LRTs.

3. Audits: Mellow collaborates with renowned security experts and audit firms, including Chainsecurity, Statemind, and Spearbit, and we only release code to production after it has passed external audits.

  1. Statemind Report: https://github.com/mellow-finance/mellow-lrt/blob/dev-symbiotic-deploy/audits/202406_Statemind/Mellow%20LRT%20report%20with%20deployment.pdf
  2. Second audit to be announced
  3. Community audit https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/423

4. Centralization vectors: Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via 24h timelocked proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.

5. Market History: Mellow has seen significant growth in TVL since launching in mid June with over 41k ETH across its 4 LRTs. Mellow

6. Value: The balancer pool is the first DEX liquidity pool for Mellow LRTs and is aimed at providing liquidity to its growing community. Mellow is committed to support LPs with a 2x points boost.

The balancer pools are already live and are available on Ethereum:

MY TELEGRAM: https://t.me/dogehacker (@dogehacker)


It all started about 3 years ago. I started my introduction to the world of cryptocurrencies. I had a great job, enough money to save. I was lucky, I made a lot of money, on the best days my profit was around $10,000. That's when I decided to lock up some of it for a long period of time.

But all good things come to an end. Now I'm in the hospital, I have a lot of unpaid bills and a hacked wallet with my tokens.

At first I thought I would just sell my steaking to an acquaintance for 50% of the value to cover my loans. But we discovered that my wallet had been hacked. Since I am a developer and have a lot of experience in WEB3 I realize that I can bypass the sweeper.

Now there is a very important question. Is there any possibility to ask you for help?

There are several solutions:

We will reach the management of pancake, they will allow me to withdraw earlier, even if at 100% loss of rewards

Users who can help - donate funds to me, and I extend steaking for a year and give the private wallet key to you

Please don't think I'm a beggar. I just happen to have a problem. If you have any questions, you are welcome to ask. I'll be able to back up what I say!

Thank you for reading the text. My wallet: 0x98d795c04a30564da1d7521f508d84e93ba6295d. Would be glad to have your support. If I get enough YES votes here, I will write a second part where I will describe everything in more detail

title: [TEMP CHECK] Safety Module - Create GHO/USDC E-CLP Category
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
created: 2024-05-13

---

# Summary

This publication proposes creating a new Safety Module (SM) category for the GHO/USDC E-CLP by Gyroscope built on Balancer v2.

# Motivation

Similarly to Staked ABPT, the ability to stake GHO liquidity pool tokens improves the value proposition of the SM by providing the dual service of deep GHO liquidity and protection in the case of protocol shortfall events. Additionally, Liquidity Providers (LPs) can also benefit from earning trading fees.

The Gyroscope protocol developed a concentrated liquidity AMM called Elliptic Liquidity Pools (E-CLPs) that sits on top of Balancer. This technology achieves liquidity efficiency by providing assymetric liquidity to a specific price range based on parameters like amplification, price boundaries and peak location. More information about E-CLPs can be found [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps).

With GHO trading close to $1.00 and the [GHO Stability Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-fund-usdc-usdt-gsm/17566) to be funded, now is an ideal time to add a GHO LP to the SM. By adding the GHO-USDC E-CLP, it is expected to significantly improve market depth as well as USDC liquidity with the SM. Unlike other pool types on Balancer, the E-CLP requires dual asset deposits upon entering the LP.

The Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) developed expertise on the E-CLP technology designing and incentivising one [pool](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0x3932b187f440ce7703653b3908edc5bb7676c283/) optimized for volume when closer to peg and another [pool](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0x99e7b15df044e1b62e2e1774fd4469d54d9409ac/) optimized for price volatility.

# Specification

After studying various configuration of Gyroscope's E-CLPs, karpatkey_TokenLogic recommends adding the following E-CLP to Aave's SM.

![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5336955108681965996-y|1280x592](upload://lf2kNSuj4SOig7aU2KZOvOFfvro.jpeg)

![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5336955108681965997-y|1280x618](upload://qtM2oYr8FuDoWtjjeflW4MkgLBV.jpeg)

Create a new GHO/USDC E-CLP SM Category with the following characteristics:

| Description     | Value  |
| ---             | :---:  |
| Lower Bound     | $0.996 |
| Upper Bound     | $1.001 |
| Peak            | 0.9995 |
| Amplification   | 1,250  |

The following initial E-CLP SM parameter configuration is proposed optimizing emissions for a target liquidity of $5M at 20% APR:

| Description            | Value              |
| ---                    | :---:              |
| Emissions Nomination   | GHO                |
| Daily Emission         | 2,750              |
| Slashing Rate          | 50%                |
| Cooldown Period        | 20 days            |

This proposal also recommends that GHO/USDC E-LCP is included in FastPass with the following initial parameters:

| Description            | Value              |
| ---                    | :---:              |
| FastPass Fee           | 100 bps            |
| Fee Destination        | Collector Contract |
| Daily Withdrawal Limit | 500k               |

In addition to the above, we also recommend implementing the strategy detailed in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-gho-usdc-usdt-bpt-to-safety-module/15195) which enables the DAO via the vlAURA hodling to vote BAL and AURA rewards to this SM Category. This option then enables the Aave DAO to use is strategic assets to partially sustain the SM category.

# Disclosure

TokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.

# Next Steps

1. Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.
2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage

Summary:

> This proposal is to add a veBAL gauge for the new DOLA/USDC stable pool on Optimism.

Protocol Description:

> Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a DAO and started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.

> Inverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;

> On the supply side of money markets, such as DAO-owned protocol FiRM, by Inverse Finance’s “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.

> Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA/FraxBP through our Convex Fed, DOLA/USDC on Velodrome, and previously DOLA/USDC on Balancer. Via purchase with DAI stablecoin using The Stabilizer. DOLA is not “algorithmic” and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.

Motivation:

> This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the DOLA/USDC stable pool on optimism. Inverse has previously obtained several veBAL gauges on Balancer and this proposal aims to build on this momentum on Optimism.

> Platform BAL incentives would also help deepen DOLA liquidity as we seek to further alleviate our dependence on the Curve ecosystem for DOLA liquidity. If approved, we expect to continue what was previously done on arbitrum for our new optimism gauge and are in coordination with various bribing platforms to facilitate the incentivization and drive the Balancer and Aura bribe market narrative.

> The Inverse Finance Team plans to continue being a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Once the DOLA/USDC stable pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would once again begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer.

Specifications:

> You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit [our official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.

Governance:

> Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to pools such as the DOLA/FraxBP [Curve pool](https://curve.fi/factory/27) as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.

Oracles:

> Inverse Finance’s new fixed-rate money market, FiRM, uses Chainlink price oracle for its wETH market. Inverse Finance’s old lending market relied on both Chainlink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable.

Audits:

> As part of our renewed smart-contract review process, Inverse Finance hosted a [bug bounty contest](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-10-inverse-finance-contest/) on the Code4rena platform to conduct a comprehensive audit of our fixed rate lending protocol, FiRM. Inverse has also recently expanded its bug bounty program [by launching a vault](https://app.hats.finance/vaults) on the Hats.finance platform. FiRM contracts were also reviewed by boutique auditing firm DefiMoon, who have been our [official security partners](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/new-security-layer-a-welcome-to-the-defi-moon-team) during Q4. In addition to providing security consulting and auditing services for FiRM, DefiMoon has also played a role in our recent deployments of [FraxBP Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/66), [Aura Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/71), and [Velo Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/68). In the immediate aftermath of our price manipulation incident, Inverse had hired leading security firm PeckShield in Q3 to perform an audit of our renewed INV oracle, as well as our [bad debt repayment product](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/How%20Inverse%20Is%20Thinking%20Outside%20The%20Box%20on%20Frontier%20Debt%20Repayments). Their report can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWNG08mib2GcI1WqnMt5IdFoW73QU2F8/view).

> The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. An announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).

Centralization vectors:

> Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:

> Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.

> Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.

> Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 9 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.

> Fed Chair: 2 of 6 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts.

> Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).

Market History:

> Inverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the “Feds”, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLA’s Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. Please see our graph below of DOLA’s peg YTD.

**Summary & Motivation:**

In the most recent omni-bus gauge clean up proposal [BIP-515](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-515-kill-unused-gauges-week-50/5467) an oversight in gauge addresses occurred for the 2eur pool. The wrong gauge was killed and must be unkilled. Also the correct gauge was not killed, and must be killed in order to maintain the initial intentions of the proposal. The purpose of this proposal is to execute the unkill of the new gauge, and kill of the old gauge.

116,"#### ABSTRACT

eComm platforms including Shopify are currently limiting adoption of $APE by not supporting it as a displayed currency on products. This proposal presents the idea that the Forever Apes team develop a custom built plugin to address this issue and facilitate the integration of $APE into the displayed currency on Shopify product pages. This plugin will be available to retailers at NO COST and will immediately enhance the platform’s functionality, while increasing visibility and encouraging wider adoption amongst their 2 million plus DAU. We’re choosing to build this plugin on Shopify but recognize it caters to a mostly North American audience, we will expand the plugin’s availability to other eComm platforms once demand is proven.

117,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to:

(1) Reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) for sixteen (16) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.

(2) Increase Reserve Factors for all collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.

## Motivation

In line with our ongoing commitment to reducing the potential risks associated with V2 markets and promoting migration to V3, we suggest a phased wind-down of the **frozen** V2 markets. The following proposal is part of a series of proposals to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets.

The previous iteration of proposals:

- [[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - Aave V2 Ethereum - 2023.6.23](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-aave-v2-ethereum-2023-6-23/13789)
- [[ARFC] Chaos Labs - Incremental Reserve Factor Updates - Aave V2 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766)

### LT Reductions

Implementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a ""moderate"" and an ""aggressive"" approach for the preliminary LT reduction.

- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) - This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations.
- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% and the value suggested by the aggressive approach.

• “Aggressive”

| MKR | 64% | 54% | 16 | 2 |
| ENS | 57% | 50% | 45 | 2 |

In the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:

|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aggressive | $10,100 | 58 |
| Moderate | $8,580 | 43 |

*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*

### LTV Decrease

For assets where the LTV is not 0, we recommend maintaining the same buffer as the current configuration.

### RF Increase

In line with our [V2 to V3 migration plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636), we propose another iteration of RF increases on Aave V2 Ethereum. By progressively increasing the reserve factors, the interest rate for supplying these assets on V2 will be increasingly less attractive, thus encouraging suppliers to transition positions to V3. In this proposal, we suggest an increase of  5% for all V2 collateral assets.

Authorize the PoolRecoveryHelper contract to put Weighted and ComposableStable pools in Recovery Mode
Authorize Balancer Labs Ops Multisig to manage the RecoveryModeEnabler contract


# Motivation

It has recently come to our attention that rate providers can cause some operations to revert if the call to `getRate` reverts. This goes undetected by most order routing algorithms, which assume rates change slowly and only use the pool's internal rate cache for estimating the expected outputs of a transaction.

In order to prevent pools with faulty rate providers from interfering with order routing algorithms, Balancer Labs has developed the [PoolRecoveryHelper](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20221123-pool-recovery-helper), a smart contract which performs checks on all rate providers of a given pool and puts the pool into Recovery Mode if one of the rate providers reverts.

The notion of Recovery Mode was introduced in recent pool factories. Only addresses authorized by Balancer Governance can put pools in Recovery Mode. 

When a pool enters Recovery Mode, any protocol fees it owes at that time are forfeited and a new exit kind is enabled, that bypasses updating the rate cache.

When a pool is put in Recovery Mode, this fact is recorded in the subgraph and order routing algorithms can ignore the pool.

The PoolRecoveryHelper contract is permissionless. Anyone can trigger a check, but the pool will only be put in Recovery Mode in the event that the rate provider required for that pool to work properly reverts.

The contract can only interact with pools deployed from a set of factories. The initial set includes the [ComposableStable](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220906-composable-stable-pool) and [Weighted](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220908-weighted-pool-v2) pool factories deployed in September. If approved, this proposal will also authorize the Balancer Labs Ops Multisig to add/remove factories to/from this set - but in addition to that safety mechanism, permissions will still have to be granted by Governance for each new factory individually just like in this proposal.

This pool is 80% palStkAave and 20% Aave. There are no yield fees applied to palStkAave.

**Resources/Useful links:**
• [Website](https://paladin.vote/#/)

• [Documentation](https://doc.paladin.vote/)

• [Github Page](https://github.com/PaladinFinance/Paladin-Protocol)

**Protocol Description:**
palstkAAVE is a liquid wrapper of stkAAVE that auto-compounds AAVE rewards from the Safety Module while also lending out its voting power on Paladin. AAVE & stkAAVE are the governance tokens for Aave.

Price volatility between assets in the pool is irrelevant because you can redeem 1:1 in Paladin and then in the Safety Module.

**Motivation:**
Paladin needs a liquidity pool between its wrapper and Aave to help users unstake their Aave faster in case of emergencies.

## I. Introduction

This proposal aims to outline how the funding and accountability process will work for any entity wishing to contribute to the Balancer ecosystem. To recap the journey so far, in early 2022 [subDAO’s were formed](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66) to give community contributors a formalized structure with clearly defined domains. More recently, the DAO has chosen to [incorporate a foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x357877d9d3d121e929f66cad2349987fc658be449585f8d021319b69a3a0e620) in order to engage with service providers who require formal contracts.

This framework aims to deliver the following benefits:

* Streamlined process for funding service providers
* Clear and decentralized accountability mechanisms
* Creation of a delegate system to enable a transparent dialogue between proposers and large token holders

## II. Process for Funding Service Providers

A service provider (“SP”) is an entity with a budget attached to it, managed by one or more Leaders, that coordinate and pay contributors working to achieve one or more long term goals in the Balancer Ecosystem. When choosing to pursue funding as a SP or through the Grants program, a rough guideline is short term or one off engagements requiring $100k or less should go through Grants. A longer term engagement or one with a cost beyond $100k should be pursued as a SP.

To keep things simple, the terms “service provider”, “working group”, and “subDAO” are considered synonyms and interchangeable. A SP can be an incorporated legal entity or simply a loosely organized group of anonymous Balancer contributors. In order to interface with the Foundation a legal agreement is required so any SP taking advantage of the Foundation must be a legal entity or a natural person.

SP's have an option to make their funding proposal through the Foundation. If it is made through the Foundation, the Foundation will create the funding proposal on the forum on behalf of the SP. The SP is expected to answer any community questions or concerns raised on the forum. Funding will be distributed to the Foundation’s wallet on a quarterly basis and from there distributed to the SP on a defined monthly basis. If the SP does not go through the Foundation then funding will be distributed directly to the SP on a quarterly basis.

*All funding proposals must include “Domains of Operation” and “Key Objectives”.*

### II.1 Domains of Operation

Examples of Domains might be core protocol development, partner integrations, marketing, business development, front end, community, etc. While some overlap is acceptable (multiple SP’s operating in the same Domains) it is generally not an effective use of DAO funds to have multiple marketing teams or multiple teams managing the community for example. Clearly indicating Domains of Operation and the expertise an SP brings to that Domain will reduce inefficient overlap and help to increase coordination in the event of necessary or useful overlap. Having multiple SP’s building front ends might represent a useful overlap, for example.

Each SP should make clear how they will handle record keeping and the handover of those records in the event they are offboarded. If an SP proposes to enter a domain of operation already occupied by another approved SP, the proposal should outline how they plan to coordinate efforts to avoid the DAO paying double for the same work. It is expected that the work product of each SP is made available to the community on a regular basis.

### II.2 Key Objectives

Key Objectives should be high level goals the SP plans to work towards and accomplish during the funding period. If appropriate, these might be broken down into a list of specific tasks. It is important that the DAO have a clear idea of what the SP is doing while also leaving enough flexibility for innovation and efficiency. Providing success metrics will also ensure the community can easily evaluate performance.

Finally, a brief overview of how the funds would be spent is the last requirement. In the event of an SP requiring additional funds before the end of the funding period a supplemental budget request can be made in the same format as a regular funding request. An estimate of the SP’s monthly spend should be included which will be used to calculate the quarterly distribution of funds.

*All SP’s going through the Foundation must upload a copy of their “Service Level Agreement” or SLA to ipfs and include the link in their funding proposal.*

## III. Accountability Mechanisms

We must ensure any funds disbursed from the DAO treasury are used transparently and in service of the Balancer Ecosystem. Ultimately veBAL holders are responsible for ensuring SP’s are delivering enough value to justify the cost of funding them. We propose the following rules for holding SP’s accountable:

* All SP’s must hold monthly community calls in any online venue of their choosing as long as it is open to the public. Failure to hold a monthly call will prevent the Foundation or the DAO from disbursing future funds. The recordings of these community calls must stay available for at least 3 months after the community call has wrapped up.
* In combination with the monthly community call, a monthly summary must also be created which details progress towards each “Key Objective” outlined by the SP in their funding proposal. This should be posted to Balancer’s forum in advance of the monthly community call.
* Anyone can make a forum proposal to the DAO to stop the Foundation/DAO from disbursing future funds to the SP. Such a proposal should include: SP in question, reason to halt funding, supporting evidence, and any other comments.
* If the vote passes, all future funding to that SP will be halted until a new funding proposal is successfully approved. If it fails, funding continues as normal.
* There will be an internal monthly meeting with mandatory attendance by at least one representative of every actively funded SP. The goal of this meeting is to ensure all SP’s are strategically aligned across the ecosystem. Ideally each SP should keep their representative the same month to month.

Every member of Balancer’s community shares responsibility for ensuring SP’s that receive funding from the treasury are acting in the best interest of the Balancer ecosystem. The rules outlined above empower every community member to act if they feel an SP is no longer acting in that best interest. The Foundation is an agent of the DAO and must honor the outcome of any legitimate snapshot vote, subject to any applicable Laws/Acts and Regulations.

## IV. Contribution Funding Pathways
 
![486b132175a0785b857c6da537b78f149eafd618_2_624x339.png](ipfs://QmQWtsoMzcvCBcu4WxMQLo2Bb9V48k2gn72pnkNgUik1ee)
    
## V. Delegate System

While anyone can initiate a proposal to stop funding a SP it is large veBAL holders who have the strongest incentive to ensure SP’s are delivering value. The creation of a delegate system will lead to a more transparent and productive dialogue between proposers and those with large voting power. We encourage anyone interested in being a delegate to present their platform to the community in the new “[Delegate Citadel](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)” section of the forum.

## VI. Voting

Delegates and token holders should not vote in favor to fund or against to defund a SP that they are working for or affiliated with. Additionally, SP’s should not compensate token holders monetarily in exchange for their votes (do not bribe on funding or defunding proposals).

There will be a third voting option added to snapshot to cover the case of a SP being affiliated with many large veBAL holders and thus failing to pass a proposal to fund them because so much voting power cannot vote in good faith. For each SP funding proposal, there will be “Yes”, “No”, and “Abstain”. It is expected that delegates and any token holders with a potential conflict of interest regarding a particular SP will only vote for “Abstain” if they choose to vote at all and provide the reason for doing so.

## VII. Risk Assessment

There are various risks to the ecosystem that could arise from the adoption of this proposal.

* A veBAL token holder might work for a SP (or the SP might have holdings of veBAL itself) and vote in favor of funding the SP despite this conflict of interest.
* A SP might get funded and not follow through on their key objectives. With funds sent on a quarterly basis, this could result in a sizable loss of funds.
* Balancer sees multiple SP funding requests and if all were funded this would represent an unsustainable burn rate.

The way to mitigate these risks is to foster an active and engaged community. Conflicts of interest should be declared up front to prevent any appearance of impropriety. Unknown or new SP’s might want to request a lower funding amount and/or utilize milestone based payments as a trial period. If milestone based payments are utilized they should be overseen by the Grants Service Provider. Delegates and those community members who handle management of treasury funds should speak up about the impact funding SP’s will have on the treasury - and it is a good idea for each SP to include their assessment of that impact in their proposal if they can.

The responsibility for stewarding the Balancer ecosystem towards a bright future lies with veBAL holders and delegates. We could try to create many rules to address many possible scenarios but we see value in creating a simple and flexible framework for funding all kinds of Balancer contributors.

## VIII. Specification

If this proposal passes, the following will be in effect:

* Any future funding proposals must adhere to the guidelines as described above. **Please find an [example template here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/how-to-create-a-funding-proposal/3233)**.
* The Ops subDAO will dissolve at the end of the second quarter. After salaries are paid for June, any remaining funds will be returned to the DAO Multisig. All powers held by Ops will return to veBAL governance.
* This proposal will mark the start of a new tracking system, BIP or Balancer Improvement Proposal. When a proposal is added to snapshot it will be given a BIP number - consider this proposal to be BIP-1.",bearish

The Venus Protocol has achieved a significant milestone in successfully eliminating 99.99% of its historical shortfall, reducing bad debt to less than $10,000.

This revised allocation aims to strike a balance between maintaining prudent risk management practices and rewarding the community that has been instrumental in the protocol’s success. It is a step towards a more sustainable and community-driven future for the Venus Protocol.

After successfully adjusting the Tokenomics, an XVS emissions adjustment will also be proposed for all Core pool markets.

123,"Summary 

The proposal to list weETH assets on Venus Protocol offers significant benefits to the Venus community, including the opportunity to add Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT) from ether.fi on ETH Mainnet. 

Users can stake their ETH, earn rewards, and enjoy additional benefits through restaking on EigenLayer. With approximately $2.7B in TVL already deposited into the ether.fi protocol, the addition of weETH to Venus can enhance asset diversity and liquidity on the platform.

By integrating weETH, Venus allows users to earn ether.fi
and EigenLayer points for future incentives, along with lending APY on their holdings. 

The proposed liquidity mining incentive offered by Ether.fi for weETH suppliers demonstrates a commitment to jumpstart the market on Venus and attract more users. This move positions Venus as a pioneer in capturing the restaking market, catering to the growing demand for LRTs and providing users with a wider range of opportunities. 

Overall, listing weETH on Venus Protocol aligns with the community's focus on decentralization, sustainability, and doing what is right for the Ethereum ecosystem. The proposal not only enhances asset diversity and liquidity but also strengthens the collaboration between Venus and ether.fi to drive innovation and value creation for users.",bullish

128,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Equilibria Finance ($EQB) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a Syrup Pool with Equilibria Finance! 

Equilibria Finance is a multi-chain DeFi platform that boosts yield for liquidity providers on Pendle. It achieves this by leveraging the vePENDLE model adopted by Pendle.

Liquidity providers who contribute to Pendle through Equilibria can now enjoy boosted rewards in both $PENDLE and $EQB, without the need of locking PENDLE and holding vePENDLE on their own.


PENDLE holders can convert their PENDLE on Equilibria and receive ePENDLE(a liquid version of vePENDLE) which can be staked to receive rewards.

#### The Syrup Pool:


Stake CAKE tokens to earn EQB tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 62,500 EQB
 - **Distribution duration:** 90 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 0900 UTC on 19 Jul 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 0900 UTC on 17 Oct 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.02411 EQB

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours of the Syrup Pool.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the EQB Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing an EQB-BNB (1.00% fee tier) v3 farm. 

The farm will have **3x** CAKE rewards for 90 days. During the farm, or at the end of the 90-day period – approx. 0900 UTC on 17 Oct 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

We request for further flexibility in the multiplier, fee tier, and duration of the EQB farm. The aggregate CAKE emission to all EQB farm(s) will remain the same, but we may adjust the multiplier(s) and duration of the farm(s) to ensure high utilization rates, ultimately maximizing CAKE burn from trading volume.

#### What is $EQB?

EQB is the name of the Equilibria Finance governance token. There are multiple utilities for EQB token such as:
- Participate in the governance
- Votes to earn bribe rewards
- Earn protocol fees by staking EQB token

130,"## Proposal
SEBA submits a proposal to Aave Governance for adding SEBA Bank as a “Whitelister” to Aave Arc.

SEBA is a licensed and supervised Swiss Bank providing a seamless and secure bridge between digital and traditional assets. SEBA serves professional and institutional clients which include top-tier private banks, asset managers and crypto companies. The interest of SEBA’s clients and prospects for crypto earning products has grown substantially overtime. Initially lending crypto and staking with SEBA, those investors are now showing significant interest for accessing yields in DeFi protocols. Due to various regulatory restrictions in their jurisdictions, SEBA’s institutional clientele has not been able deploy liquidities at large scale in Aave until now. The launch of Aave Arc with its permissioned layer represents a great opportunity for them to access DeFi yields while remaining compliant with their regulatory obligations. At SEBA, we believe that this will directly benefit the Aave community with institutional liquidities accelerating growth in TVL and in protocol revenues. 

The Aave Governance will review and approve Whitelisters that will conduct the requisite level of due diligence on Aave Arc participants. As a Swiss digital asset bank, we believe that SEBA is ideally positioned to provide those investors with the flexible and fully regulated platform that they need to bridge new liquidities in Aave Arc.

## About SEBA Bank
Founded in April 2018 and headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, SEBA Bank is a pioneer in the banking industry with the mission to build a regulated and progressive technological bridge between the traditional and the crypto worlds. With a FINMA banking and securities dealer license, SEBA Bank closes an important gap between the new digital economy and traditional banking. SEBA Bank enables professional individuals and companies as well as institutional clients to invest, custody, trade, stake, lend and borrow digital and traditional assets, all in one place. 

What SEBA brings to the Aave Arc community:

*	A fully regulated digital assets bank that embraces innovation
*	With a large institutional client base in demand for exploring new opportunities in DeFi
*	And with a banking-grade platform to securely bridge liquidities in Aave ARC

131,"#### Upgrade of Magpie’s Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift Magpie’s Farm rewards from the current MGP-BUSD v2 LP to the new MGP-BNB v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the MGP-BNB v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the MGP token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current MGP price.)

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new Farm will have doubled emissions for the first 7 days. For example, if the v2 farm is emitting 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will emit 20 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 10 CAKE per day thereafter. 

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake MGP-**BUSD** LP, earn CAKE
- 2x multiplier
- **84 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.25% fee tier):
- Stake MGP-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 4x multiplier (8x multiplier for the first 7 days)
- 168 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and **84 CAKE per day** thereafter 

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 4x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### What is Magpie?

Magpie is a multi-chain platform providing Yield & veTokenomics boosting services.

Magpie aims to:
- Help liquidity providers generate boosted yields without the need for locking WOM
- Enable WOM holders to earn passive income from their idle WOM tokens
- Enable Wombat Exchange voters to acquire Wombat Exchange voting power in a cost-effective manner

#### What is $MGP?

- Revenue sharing
- Delegated voting power on Wombat Exchange”

HAL makes it simple to monitor and build automated workflows based on real-time blockchain data. Our mission is to ""glue"" together centralised and decentralised technologies (https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-gluing-manifesto-159cabef0532) to help the ecosystem strive. By leveraging push notifications, DAOs can increase user engagements and provide additional value to their members.

This proposal looks to embed the HAL notification system into the Aave UI.

### Motivation

Given the market volatility, it is critical for Aave's lenders and borrowers to carefully monitor their positions to prevent liquidation. HAL's Aave recipes (https://9000.hal.xyz/aave) are already used by thousands of users for risk management.

Adding HAL into the Aave UI will unlock additional level of protocol engagement and security for all Aave users.

### Benefits for the Aave community

The integration would allow all AAVE users to be notified about the status of their Health Factor. Using our recipe, AAVE users can be notified in real time on the health factor conditions of their position, thus greatly reducing the risk of being liquidated.

Moreover, this integration increases the trust within the AAVE community, allowing anyone to have access to information on the health factor in a straightforward form and with the possibility of receiving a notification via Email, Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Slack and Webhook. We already witnessed a similar positive feedback loop in the past when we did a similar integration with Bancor (https://twitter.com/HAL_Team/status/1389945442818011140).

142,"Summary:

Harmony is proposing to work with the Curve to deploy Curve on the Harmony blockchain. This will expand stablecoin swap to its community of users and provide incentives to bootstrap the launch of Curve to a new ecosystem.

Abstract:

Our proposal is to support Curve as it continues to expand in the coming multi-chain world. Harmony is an open and fast blockchain that is fully Ethereum compatible with 2-second transaction finality and near-zero fees.

Harmony invites the Curve community to support this launch. Harmony will provide $2 million in incentives in ONE tokens to bootstrap initial usage of Curve on Harmony. We also propose the Curve community to contribute CRV tokens to add incentives to the launch.

In addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support.

Harmony is a sharded proof-of-stake blockchain. It has processed more than 93 million transactions on mainnet 4 and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible. Our secure bridges offer cross-chain asset transfers with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.

Motivation:

Curve is ready to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Harmony ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Sushi on Harmony and other DeFi projects.

A unique feature of Harmony is our bridges to Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain which are bringing in stablecoins and pegged assets from both ecosystems, i.e. ethBUSD-bscBUSD. This creates an unique opportunity for Curve to support stablecoin swapping of assets from multiple chains.

Specification:

The Harmony and Curve will deploy the Curve contracts and gauge on Harmony. Harmony supports EVM and Ethereum tooling, leading to a seamless integration, much like other EVM chains and L2s. During Harmony’s DeFi Hackathon in Sep 2020, a community team already successfully ported Curve on testnet: GitHub - harmony-one/dapp-curve-contracts 3 and GitHub - harmony-one/dapp-curve-ui: Frontend for curve.fi on harmony.one 6).

After the market is functional, we will work with the Curve for cross-chain governance implementation on Curve on Harmony.

Metrics
over 18,010 delegators and 118 validators, staking 4.2 billion ONEs ($700m staked)
$84 million TVL on Sushi on Harmony, and $30 million combined on other DEXes
$91 million TVL on Harmony’s bridge to Ethereum and BSC
3,200 creators and $1.6 million sales on DaVinci NFT marketplace

Title: [ARC] SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool
Staus: Proposal
Author: @llamaxyz @MatthewGraham
Dated: 2022-11-14

---

# Simple Summary

@llamaxyz proposed assigning the SD `Emission_Admin` role on the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool to a Gnosis Safe controlled by the Stader Labs.

# Abstract

The Stader Labs team intends to distribute SD incentives to the MaticX Reserve on Polygon Aave v3.

In order to achieve this, the `EmissionManager` contract needs to assign an owner to the `Emission_Admin` permission allowing SD rewards to be distributed, [1,2]. This can only be achieved via the governance process.

This proposal assigns the `Emission_Admin` permission to SD rewards to the following address `matic:0x51358004cFe135E64453d7F6a0dC433CAba09A2a`.

# Motivation

The motivation of the proposal is to enable SD rewards to be distributed on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.

Please do note a similar request was submitted enabling the distribution of LDO and stMATIC rewards by Lido and the Polygon Foundation respectively across the Polygon Aave v3 liquidity pool, [3,4].

# Specification

The Stader Labs team will determine the emission rate and duration SD rewards are offered. This will likely be influenced by the Aave DAO’s ability to adjust the wMATIC and MaticX risk parameters that enable users to generate a return from leverage the MaticX / wMATIC loop.

The `Emission_Admin` is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool. The `EmissionManager` role grants the SD `Emission_Admin` role to a specified wallet address. The `Emission_Admin` can distribute SD rewards across the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool.

# Implementation

Set `Emission_Admin` permission for SD (`matic:0x1d734A02eF1e1f5886e66b0673b71Af5B53ffA94`) on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool to Stader Lab’s address: `matic:0x51358004cFe135E64453d7F6a0dC433CAba09A2a`, [5,6].

146,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

Firstly, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to the Trading Allocation (and therefore farms) – the per block allocation to the Trading Allocation will remain at [**~1.88 CAKE/block**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics).

Importantly, the purpose of this proposal is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. 

By boosting APRs for higher-performing farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below. Rewards will be redistributed from farms with reduced multipliers to farms with increased multipliers, along with all other existing farms. This will give us increased capacity to establish Syrup Pool/Farm arrangements with more partner projects.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, etc.

Title: [ARFC] Polygon v2 Borrow Rate Adjustments
Author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic & @ChaosLabs 
Created: 2024-04-04

---

# Summary

This publication proposes gradually revising the Borrow Rate on Polygon v2 to provide further encouragement for users to migrate to Aave v3.

# Motivation

Over the last [8 months](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/284/) the Reserve Factor (RF) on Polygon v2 has gradually increased from as low as 21.00% to 99.99%. As a result, deposit yield converged to zero and the capital efficiency of Aave v2 has been reduced on Polygon.

With the RF now approaching the maximum across all reserves, this publication seek to gradually increase the cost of capital via periodic borrow rate adjustments, every two weeks in a predictable fashion.

Based upon recent borrow rates behaviour, the market has demonstrated the ability to withstand periods of elevated borrowing rates. 

## Non Frozen Assets

For non-frozen assets, this proposal recommends increasing the Slope1 parameter by 75bps every two weeks, or 1.5% per month, to encourage further migration of users from v2 to v3. The outcome of this [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe2dd228640c3cad93f5418c40c4b5743b3c6c85aa0aae9eee53cbdbca2ed5c2d) has been taken into consideration when drafting the current IR parameters included in this proposal.

The Slope2 parameter is to be revised to discourage utilisation exceeding the Uoptimal value. Note, several reserves are experiencing utilisation marginally exceeding Uoptimal. 

As utilisation of each reserve decreases over time, the Uoptimal will be periodically lowered to discourage new debt positions emerging. Any proposed changes to the Uoptimal parameter will be presented via a separate ARFC. 

Upon implementation, this change will not trigger liquidation of any users funds and will gradually increase the cost for users who remain on v2. Please note, there is a Migration Tool that was developed by BGD to aid users migrating from v2 to v3. 

Assets in scope: DAI, MATIC, wBTC, wETH, USDC and USDT.

## Frozen Assets

Each frozen reserve contains a small portion of funds with a very minimal amount of debt. For these assets we recommend a more aggressive implementation: reduce the Uoptimal to 10.00%, revise Slope1 to 50.00% and Slope2 to 500.00% - with  the exception of BAL, which receives a Uoptimal of 20% due to current utilisation being around 15%.

Assets in scope: BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK and SUSHI.

# Specification

The following parameters are to be updated as follows:

| Asset | Current Slope1 | Proposed Slope1 | Current Uoptimal | Proposed Uoptimal | Current Slope2 | Proposed Slope2 |
| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---:  |   :---:   |
| BAL   | 27.00% | 50.00% | 65.00% | 20.00% | 236.00% | 500.00% |
| CRV   | 17.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 392.00% | 500.00% |
| DAI   | 12.00% | 12.75% | 71.00% | 71.00% | 105.00% |   200.00% |
| GHST  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 23.00% | 10.00% | 413.00% | 500.00% |
| LINK  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 402.00% | 500.00% |
| USDT  | 12.00% | 12.75% | 52.00% | 52.00% | 236.00% |   236.00% |
| wBTC  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 37.00% | 37.00% | 536.00% |   536.00% |
| wETH  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 40.00% | 40.00% | 167.00% |   200.00% |
| wMATIC|  6.00% |  6.75% | 48.00% | 48.00% | 440.00% |   500.00% |
| wUSDC | 12.00% | 12.75% | 77.00% | 77.00% | 134.00% |   200.00% |

Subject to approval from @ChaosLabs, a subsequent proposal will be submitted every two weeks.

# Next Steps

1) Gather feedback from the community.
2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage
4) Review, and where applicable, submit an AIP every 2 weeks

154,"We [Blockchain at Michigan](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal for initiating Uniswap v3 deployment on the Avalanche blockchain. With the BSL expiring on April 1st, the Uniswap Foundation has [stated](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-deployment-guide/19988?u=gfxlabs) the importance of Uniswap v3 expansion to popular EVM chains. Establishing Uniswap on alt L1s–and not just on Ethereum L2s–is vital for establishing a robust, multichain future. After consulting with the Ava Labs team, we believe that this is a crucial and opportune time for Uniswap to expand to Avalanche’s growing ecosystem.

## Proposal Motivation

The primary urgency behind this proposal is the upcoming BSL expiration on April 1st. As soon as the license expires, all entities will have the legal right to duplicate Uniswap v3 and utilize the forked code for commercial purposes. Invariably, large chains like Avalanche will see a rapid influx of v3 copycats, which will dilute the markets on those respective chains. It is therefore imperative for Uniswap v3 to get ahead of the competitors by launching on large chains before duplicates arise. Trader Joe v2, the current leading DEX on Avalanche, did [$92.45M](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/avalanche) of volume in the past 24 hours (Feb 23)–indicative of the demand for a concentrated liquidity AMM. Due to the continual growth of the Avalanche ecosystem, along with the liquidity present on the platform, we believe that this proposal be enacted as soon as possible to ensure that Uniswap establishes a foothold in the Avalanche DEX market.

We realize that beyond the chain of deployment, the community must also consider the required cross-chain messaging protocol. Although the DAO previously coalesced to utilize [Wormhole for the BNB Chain deployment](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x6b8df360fdf73085b21fdf5eef9f85916fbde95621a3d454cb20fbe545ffc852), we believe that such a decision should not set a precedent for bridge selection. A vendor lock-in model would prevent the further testing of equally renowned messaging protocols like LayerZero. A handful of delegates and tokenholders have also pioneered a more novel approach to governance messaging, where cross-chain governance relies not on a single bridge but simultaneously on a handful of bridges. Although we see the merits of a [multi-bridge system](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148/1), it will take time for this approach to garner attention and be fully vetted. The DAO can decide to opt into a multi bridge system in the future–but for an agile deployment that can be implemented in the present, we believe that LayerZero is the best solution.

## Current State of Avalanche
Avalanche is a blockchain platform that utilizes three separate blockchains, the Platform Chain (P-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), and Exchange Chain (X-Chain), to improve scalability and interoperability. These three chains compose a consortium of validators called the Primary Network, which is responsible for Avalanche’s security.

Avalanche operates with the Avalanche consensus algorithm, which is designed to be more efficient than alternative consensus mechanisms and enables EVM-compatibility. The consensus mechanism checks validators’ transaction confirmations randomly by allowing all nodes to work in parallel, increasing the probability that a transaction is valid. The C-Chain leverages the Snowman consensus protocol, which mimics Avalanche consensus but is optimized for smart contract integration. Therefore, most Avalanche dAPP activity currently transpires on the C-chain. 

In comparison to other smart contract platforms, Avalanche touts 2-second time-to-finality, faster than any of its peers (ex. Ethereum finality is 10 minutes). Uniswap on Avalanche would thereby enhance the user experience for both application users and liquidity providers. 

Avalanche also allows for an unbounded number of validators without sacrificing block time. This allows for an increasing degree of decentralization over time. In Q4 2022, the platform’s [Nakamoto coefficient increased from 30 to 32](https://nakaflow.io/)–surpassing most other L1s–and is poised to continue in an upward direction. Currently, there are [1,228 validators](https://www.avax.network/validators) and over [233M AVAX tokens staked](https://www.avax.network/validators). The expanding validator set and staked AVAX tokens exemplify a robust L1.

The Avalanche architecture permits a high degree of scalability through its ecosystem of subnets. Similar to Ethereum’s L2s, subnets allow for outsourcing blockspace from the Primary Network to alternative blockchains. Application-specific blockchains can be launched under customized subnets, granting builders control over their development stack (subnets specify their own execution logic, fee regime, state, networking, and security). Large protocols that initially relied on the C-Chain, like DFK and StepNetwork, are now migrating to their individualized subnets. The increase in subnets furthers the security of Avalanche since each subnet’s validators must simultaneously secure the Primary Network.

Increased application activity on the C-Chain and subnets presents Avalanche as an expanding ecosystem. At the time of writing, according to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/chains), Avalanche holds over $950M of TVL across 281 different protocols.

Since launching in Q3 2020, Avalanche’s txn count has cumulatively increased to nearly [700M](https://avascan.info/). Messari reported that between Nov 2021 - Nov 2022 alone, the network experienced [YoY txn growth of 1,507%](https://research.nansen.ai/article/529/avalanche-scaling-with-subnets). Although [daily active users remained relatively steady since Summer 2022](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/avalanche), average daily transactions increased from ~1M to ~3M, indicating the emergence of power users. A reliable user base is imperative for a properly functioning Uniswap protocol. The presence of long-term liquidity provision would aid in bootstrapping individual subnets as well as making the C-Chain more robust.

Post deployment, the most fierce competitor for Uni v3 will be Trader Joe. Since Trader Joe recently released a Uni v3-like, [capital efficient AMM](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/), Uniswap has an incentive to capture as much of Avalanche’s DEX market prior to Trader Joe v2 locking in a concrete user base. Plus, after the BSL expires in April, numerous Uni v3 forks will invariably launch on Avalanche. Therefore, to minimize Uniswap’s dilution in the Avalanche ecosystem, the DAO is incentivized to launch v3 as soon as possible.

Due to Uniswap’s strong brand, it has the ability to capture market share from existing DEXs and attract liquidity from new users. A notable historical anecdote is Polygon. Once Uni v3 launched on Polygon, it quickly acquired market share from both Quickswap and Sushiswap. Although this experiment is yet to be tested on an alt L1, it is likely that a similar pattern will surface on Avalanche–although Trader Joe may present a higher degree of friction. Nonetheless, it is not necessary that the DEX competition will result in a zero-sum game and can favor both Trader Joe and Uniswap simultaneously. 

Apart from DeFi developments, Avalanche has also made strides in other sectors like gaming, NFTs, and user adoption. Further facilitation of each of these categories is enabled by a DEX like Uniswap. And in turn, Uniswap liquidity providers–and maybe token holders–will attain economic value from the protocol’s increased usage. 

## Safety and Cross-Chain Governance

### LayerZero Overview
We propose using LayerZero, an omnichain bridging solution, to facilitate cross-chain message passing between Ethereum and Avalanche. LayerZero has pre-existing support for both Avalanche and Ethereum.

The [first use case of Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) transfer](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/layerzero-aims-to-create-one-unified-experience-for-btc-b-339eb4d23672) has been active for nearly 4 months on Avalanche. LayerZero allows Avalanche BTC (BTC.b) bridging between all LayerZero-supported chains, creating a composable, unified liquidity system for BTC. From the 25+ supported chains, two, DFK and Swimmer, are run as their own subnets. Apart from cross-chain asset transferring, LayerZero also supports arbitrary message passing–which includes governance communication between Uniswap on Ethereum to Avalanche.

LayerZero is backed by the likes of a16z, Sequoia, Uniswap Labs, Coinbase, and numerous others–it is supported by thousands of cross-chain builders with over 2,000 contracts deployed on mainnet, ~700 unique applications, ~2M total messages, ~$5B transactional volume, and billions of dollars in TVL.

**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**

LayerZero endpoints rely on an architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and two off-chain entities called oracles and relayers to securely relay messages between endpoints on a source and destination chain. The oracle is responsible for relaying block headers, and with the default LayerZero setup, will be handled by Chainlink. A transaction proof is sent using the relayer; the default relayer is operated by LayerZero. Hence, the security of the system relies on 2 entities. The primary assumption behind this setup is that the oracle and relayer remain independent at all times. Collusion between the entities would lead to a compromised system. Uniswap will have the option to operate one or both of these entities which would decrease the possibility of collusion.

**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**

LayerZero leverages direct MPT validation construction of the source transaction and verifies the merkle inclusion proof directly on the destination chain via the protocol’s novel Ultra Light Node (ULN).

**Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?**

Malicious message transmission is a possibility if there is a compromise of both the oracle and relayer sets. Both entities would have to agree to approve a fraudulent message together and against the same application. For example, the decentralized Chainlink DON would have to actively collude with the LayerZero Labs relayer at the same time to enable passing of a malicious message. If the application selects multiple oracles and multiple relayers, thereby pricing its security higher, fraudulent message passing would require more independent parties to be simultaneously compromised.

**What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?**

Unlike some other bridges, LayerZero does not pose an economic stake or bond to punish malicious actors via a slashing mechanism. Instead, if the default oracle-relayer configuration is compromised, then there is a reputational backlash that would beset LayerZero and Chainlink–since they are the entities responsible for the relayer and oracle, respectively. However, if Uniswap decides to control the messaging stack by running either the oracle or relayer, then Uniswap itself will have to answer for its shortcomings if there happens to be malicious activity.

LayerZero is also designed to be censorship resistant. Oracles and Relayers cannot censor messages without censoring all messages due to the sequential nonce ordered enforcement on the receiving chain. As a result, if an attacker obtained control of the Uniswap-selected Oracles or Relayers, and succeeded in censoring a message, every subsequent message would also be censored and the vote would stop. Uniswap could then expediently resolve the issue by updating configurations and messaging would resume.

**Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?**

Immutability is part and parcel to LayerZero’s infrastructure. Its smart contracts are not upgradable and therefore aren’t prone to bugs due to smart contract updates. Smart contract bugs is the predominant historical cause for bridge exploits, as was the case with Wormhole’s $300M and Nomad’s $190M hack in 2022. To ensure that the current LayerZero contracts are reliable enough to be set in stone and entirely independent from LayerZero Labs’ future involvements, the protocol has been [audited 35+ times](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/Audits) and reviewed at least 3+ times by the LayerZero Labs team.

LayerZero is the only major cross-chain messaging protocol to have secured significant transaction volume (~$5B) over time without any exploit, compromise of key infrastructure, or loss of user funds. Additionally, LayerZero has the [largest live bug bounty across the industry at up to $15M](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-security-update-april-2022-4c27a22380b4).

### Future Bridge Alterations
Following deployment, if Uniswap governance would like to switch to a different bridge setup, the DAO can do so with a future proposal. There are current ruminations regarding a multi bridge messaging setup–but that is too early to implement for this proposal. Much like the recent BNB Chain deployment proposal, we recommend utilizing a single bridge for the time being and integrating a more novel system later on after the BSL expiration. 

## License Exemption
We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow LayerZero to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Avalanche, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap v3 will be deployed on Avalanche by LayerZero Labs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)”. LayerZero Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.

## Timeline
Once the on-chain governance proposal is completed, LayerZero Labs will deploy the Uniswap v3 smart contracts on the Avalanche C-Chain. Uniswap Labs will handle the front-end integration updates and include Avalanche to the auto router. Altogether, this deployment will take ~5 weeks to complete.",neutral

156,"I Think Pancake should compensate for everyone who locked there $Cake away when the APR Was over 25% (i staked at 48). The token is losing value and there is 2 things that would normally happen, 1. ITS LOCKED APR So it shouldnt change or 2. APR Will rise to compensate for the value loss. neither of these have happened and everyone whos stuck in staking is currently down on there investment and the apr is also so low its not worth it being in it anymore.

Either set a date where anyone who wants to can withdraw are locked staking as you have changed the APR and rules so that should allow us to uninvest if we no longer aline together or burn a SUBSTANTIAL Amount of total supply token's to substitute for the losses we have occured.

Because in my eye's all your doing in pushing products for farming pools or new customers and letting the current ones rott without addressing anyone that is questioning you about it. Or do an AMA So we can ask the questions that need answering",bullish

158,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197)

# Motivation

The [Emergency DAO](https://dao.curve.fi/emergencymembers) is an idea pioneered by Curve that empowers a small group to “kill” pools and gauges in the event of malicious activity and/or potential loss of funds. So far the power has only been used once to [kill the Mochi pool](https://gov.curve.fi/t/the-curve-emergency-dao-has-killed-the-usdm-gauge/2307).

This proposal is being presented as a response to the situation Balancer is facing regarding the three element pools ([1](https://app.element.fi/pools/0xEdf085f65b4F6c155e13155502Ef925c9a756003?action=redeem))([2](https://app.element.fi/pools/0x4bd6D86dEBdB9F5413e631Ad386c4427DC9D01B2?action=redeem))([3](https://app.element.fi/pools/0x7Edde0CB05ED19e03A9a47CD5E53fC57FDe1c80c?action=redeem)) which were grandfathered into the gauge voting system when veBAL launched. A single LP has staked in the gauges and has bribed on hidden hand to entice voters while this single actor collects all the emissions.

Given that these element pools have expired they should no longer be eligible for BAL emissions.

The Emergency subDAO will be a 4-of-7 multisig with the following members:

* Solarcurve (0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3)
* Mike B (0xF01Cc7154e255D20489E091a5aEA10Bc136696a8)
* Zekraken (0xafFC70b81D54F229A5F50ec07e2c76D2AAAD07Ae)
* Zen Dragon (0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17)
* Markus (0x6bB4720473d4D7133f944785e5EE1A650C07f34e)
* Fernando (0xbbF0Ae5195444264364CA7eb7E3BB1971B4c3eCb)
* Nico (0x815d654E930E840D0E0Ee1B18FFc8Fb4ddA4c6B3)

Gnosis safe address: `0xA29F61256e948F3FB707b4b3B138C5cCb9EF9888`

A governance proposal will be required to change signers of this multisig. To be clear, Balancer’s Emergency subDAO will only have the power to kill gauges. Balancer pools cannot be “killed” by governance after the pool factory has been deployed for three months.

An additional power of the Emergency subDAO will be to add a token to the deny list on the newly created “[ProtocolFeesWithdrawer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introduce-protocolfeeswithdrawer/3188)” contract. In order for a token to be added back to the allow list a veBAL governance vote would be required. A token would only be added to the deny list in the event of an issue along the lines of the recent [Synthetix bug disclosure](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/medium-severity-bug-found/3161).

159,"**Authors: Uniswap Accountability Committee**

## TLDR:

* Today, Uniswap governance, via the timelock address, has the ability to declare a new v3/v2 deployment as official/canonical
* The DAO has set a precedent for approving EVM-based deployments over the past 2 years
* This proposal seeks to give the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig agency over altering the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth & v2deployments.uniswap.eth subdomains
* This will allow the Committee to edit these text records whenever a new v3/v2 deployment is complete without having to go through an onchain vote
* To accommodate for this change, we are also proposing an alteration to the current deployment governance process to increase efficiency
* The DAO will retain the right to assign incentive distributions from the treasury to these deployments via an onchain vote

## Our Proposal

**We are proposing to enable the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig to alter the subdomains as soon as a deployment’s RFC passes the 7-day discussion period–given there are no major points of contention during the RFC phase.** The RFC should give ample time to the DAO to make a decision regarding the deployment without having to partake in a 4+ week governance ordeal. And to make sure voters have a say in this process, we are including a 5-day challenge period that will be a part of the onboarding package temperature check--this will allow voters to voice their dissenting opinion regarding a deployment. 

Currently, the Uniswap DAO, more specifically the timelock address (0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC) owns AND manages both subdomains. This proposal would make the Accountability Committee the manager of the subdomains. If at any time the DAO would like to alter the manager again or regain control, this can be done via an onchain vote since the timelock still owns the subdomains.

### New Proposed Deployment Process:

**Step 1**

* If a chain wants to deploy Uniswap, they typically connect with either the Foundation, the Accountability Committee, a delegate, or any adjacent party
* Anyone is able to author an RFC, whether it be a delegate, the destination chain themselves, or whoever else. That RFC is posted on the forum for a minimum of seven days to allow a discussion to transpire
* The deployer can either have the contracts deployed at this point or not–if the deployment is complete, then include the contracts in the RFC
* **If no issues arise in the RFC, then the deployment will be viewed as approved, and a 5-day challenge period will be rolled into the onboarding package snapshot vote**

**Step 2.1 (Work for the Deployer and Accountability Committee)**

* If deployment hasn’t already been completed, then it must be done after the RFC phase
* As soon as contracts are deployed and verified, ensuring that the bytecode of the deployed contracts matches the bytecode of the mainnet contracts, **the Accountability Committee has the authority to write the relevant text to the subdomain**
* The Committee will comment on the RFC confirming that the contracts have been verified and that the subdomain has been properly updated

**Step 2.2 (Work for the DAO and Accountability Committee)**

* The Committee will hold a temperature check to see if there’s interest in deploying incentives on the new fork--this vote also acts as the challenge period
* If passed, an onchain vote will take place, sending the selected amount of capital to the Committee multisig for distribution

***Both Step 2.1 & 2.2 can take place concurrently*

## Technical Implementation:

The onchain proposal needs to include the function calls below to grant the Accountability Committee write permissions to the subdomains. The DAO will maintain ownership of the primary domain, uniswap.eth, and thus have the ability to revoke permission through a governance vote.

**For Uniswap v3 Subdomain:**
```solidity

# Summary

Balancer OpCo Limited is seeking to engage with a professional market maker to enhance the liquidity and trading experience for BAL tokens in central exchanges. As a leading player in the rapidly growing DeFi space, Balancer recognizes the importance of providing a seamless and efficient trading environment for its governance token.

By partnering with a reputable market maker, Balancer will aim to achieve increased liquidity that enables traders to enter and exit positions with minimal slippage, attracting a wider range of participants and fostering greater adoption of the Balancer protocol. This improved market depth will enhance price stability across exchanges, while reducing volatility and instilling confidence in BAL token holders, fostering governance participation.

A robust presence in central exchanges will contribute to a healthier and more vibrant ecosystem, benefiting all stakeholders involved in the Balancer project.

Given the recent [announcement ](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-extend-the-monitoring-tag-to-include-bal-ctxc-cvp-cvx-dock-hard-iris-mbl-pols-snt-sun-and-remove-the-monitoring-tag-for-mln-zen-on-2024-07-01-782b121c462b499487dc8f20e0edc6b2)from Binance to include BAL in its Monitoring Tag list as of July 1st, 2024, due to heightened volatility and risk concerns, it has now become a focus of the Balancer community to address and mitigate these issues.

Given the competitive nature of the DeFi landscape, Balancer believes this engagement is a strategic imperative, ensuring its continued listing and long-term success. By partnering with a firm that possesses the expertise, resources, and track record to deliver exceptional results, Balancer is confident in its ability to further solidify its position as a leading player in the DeFi space and continue to drive innovation.

# Proposal:

In order to facilitate the business negotiation process where signing of mutual NDAs are required and comply with regulatory requirements, we request this to be done from within the Foundation/OpCo environment, with the advisory of different Balancer DAO contributors, including Karpatkey.

To address the challenges outlined above and achieve our objectives, the core terms of this engagement may include:

1. Token Loan: Balancer DAO will grant 1,000,000 BAL tokens to Balancer OpCo, which will be able to lend out this partial/full amount to the selected market maker for a maximum period of 18 months.
2. Call Options: Balancer OpCo is open to negotiating call options for the market maker, allowing them to purchase loaned or additional BAL tokens at pre-determined strike prices.
3. Repayment Terms and Strikes: Repayment terms and strike prices ranges will be determined through a collaborative negotiation process, taking into account the desired outcomes for both parties.
4. Multiple Tranches and Tenors: The loan can be structured into multiple tranches with varying tenors, allowing for greater flexibility and customization based on the desirable strategies.
5. Compliant Onboarding: Balancer OpCo is committed to ensuring the market maker has a compliant onboarding process for Balancer. This includes adhering to all relevant regulations and conducting thorough due diligence to mitigate any potential risks.
6. Additional Listings: Balancer OpCo may weigh in the negotiations with market makers and potential Tier 2 exchanges listings of interest, increasing BAL participation on the global market, such as OKX, Bybit, Kucoin etc.

Results are to be followed by DAO contributors and Karpatkey, and published on the forum regularly by OpCo.

164,"## Motivation

Currently Gauntlet manages dynamic fees for any two token pool which has delegated fee control to them on mainnet. With the advent of MetaStable and Stable pools and the increased complexity in managing not only the swap fee but the amplification parameter, Gauntlet wasn't able to accept management of these pool types immediately. They have signaled they are ready now, so we are proceeding with this vote quickly so these pools can start working better for our LP's and for the protocol. 

This proposal would only cover mainnet MetaStable and Stable Pools and only allow Gauntlet to manage the swap fee and amplification parameter.

165,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Bril Finance’s Integration to Position Manager on BNB Chain!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re excited to announce an extension for CAKE rewards on Bril’s vaults. 

Bril Finance offers a DeFi integration that helps users manage their assets, optimize their earnings, and reduce the effort needed for managing positions. 

Users can deposit single-sided assets into Bril's vaults which are managed by Bril's smart contracts. These smart contracts will allocate the assets into PancakeSwap's v3 AMMs with a range of automated liquidity strategies to earn CAKE yield for users.

The CAKE rewards on Bril’s vaults have been adjusted to ensure **CAKE is distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner for CAKE holders.**

#### Bril Finance’s Vaults & Liquidity Pools:

Deposit single-sided assets to earn additional CAKE rewards on top of LP rewards. (Please note that the deposit token is the **first token** in the pair).

For example, for the **USDT**-WBNB (0.05%) pair, users will deposit USDT ONLY, and the SC will execute strategies to utilize the deposited USDT for the USDT-WBNB (0.05%) LP.


Vaults with an additional 1,200 CAKE rewards:
- **WBNB**-CAKE (0.25%)
- **USDT**-CAKE (0.25%) 
- **BTCB**-CAKE (0.25%)

Vaults with an additional 500 CAKE rewards:
- **USDT**-WBNB (0.05%)
- **BTCB**-USDT (0.05%)
- **ETH**-CAKE (0.25%)

CAKE rewards will be distributed with the following criteria:
- **Distribution duration:** 14 days
- **Total tokens:** 5100 CAKE 
- **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 13 Nov 2023
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 27 Nov 2023

The CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from Bril’s vaults will encourage more users to deposit single-sided assets, increasing LP liquidity, and ultimately leading to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

| Image taken from our [**tokenomics page**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics) |

Before the Finish Time of 27 Nov 2023, we will evaluate the performance of the vaults, and if appropriate, determine whether further incentivization would benefit CAKE holders.

#### Bril’s Manager Fee

There will be a **7%** manager fee introduced on all LP rewards earned via Bril Finance’s vaults.

#### How do you deposit into Bril’s Vaults?

Deposit single-sided assets into Bril’s Vaults on PancakeSwap’s Position Manager:

#### What is the difference between Bril Finance and ICHI?

Bril Finance and ICHI are partnering to provide users with the above single-sided asset vaults. 

Bril Finance will be the user-facing interface, while ICHI will handle the smart contracts for the vaults.

171,"## Summary

A proposal to whitelist Connext, a trust minimized cross chain protocol, for V3 Portals on 6 chains: Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony - with credit lines for USDC ($2m on each chain), USDT ($1m on each chain) and ETH (40 ETH on each chain).

## Reasonale

[Connext](https://connext.network) is a network for **fast, trustless communication between chains and rollups**. It is the only interoperability system of its type that does this cheaply and quickly without introducing any new trust assumptions. Connext is aimed at developers who are looking to build bridges and other natively **cross-chain applications**.
To date, over $1.3b in transactions have crossed the network.

Our network of liquidity providers only works with native assets, or the most canonical representation of a wrapped asset.

With our [Amarok upgrade](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4), a series of improvements are coming for users, developers and liquidity providers (routers): the latest will be tasked with providing capital upfront to the users, while getting refunded within 30 minutes when the slower confirmation, coming from the [Optimistic communication protocol Nomad](https://blog.connext.network/optimistic-bridges-fb800dc7b0e0), is completed.

Users’ transactions get confirmed in seconds, LPs get rewarded with a fee on the transaction for their service.

**Portals are therefore a perfect match for Connext as our LPs will need and want to access immediate extra liquidity to fulfill transactions, and our new architecture allows for this operation to be completed via the protocol in a trust minimized way**.

## Technical Specifications

Connext is much more than a bridge, it’s an **interoperability protocol**: it allows to build cross chain applications without adding trust assumptions.
One of these applications are bridges, others could be cross chain NFTs marketplaces or cross chain governance portals.

**51 routers are currently providing $40m+ of liquidity.**
The highly capital efficient architecture of Connext allows for higher volume (and therefore higher returns) with less capital compared to other solutions in the space.
The system is currently working on a whitelist basis. Once the [NEXT token](https://blog.connext.network/whats-next-d3044de49397) is live, the whole network will be permissionless.

## How does it work?

This is an overview of the Amarok architecture that is currently on testnet and planned to go live in a few weeks:

![image](ipfs://QmZVvSsU5ra6vFvMiu82iMAieP1LFuS44EjsbLJVkeUj8N)

The new flow heavily utilizes Nomad (and eventually other localized messaging layers) for its security model. Routers front capital and execute calls for a user’s transaction, and claim against funds going through Nomad.


A full overview can be found [here](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4).

This model fits with the Aave Portals. This is how the simplified architecture integrating Portals will look like - credits to Delphi Digital for the image.

![image](ipfs://QmYug4RrSW8SgjdtqQY21ALDk7gYS1HcH8mSa5Jo4v4sqk)

([Development progress deep dive](https://github.com/connext/nxtp/pull/1074)).

The logic for the execute and reconcile methods for the Aave portals has been completed and is ready for audit.

#### Is there a fee model for participants?
LPs currently take a 5bps fee from every transaction

Analytics dashboard of Connext: https://connextscan.io

Bridge for users: https://bridge.connext.network

Technical documentation: https://docs.connext.network

## Proposed list Credit Line request

The credit lines are requested for the following networks where both Connext and Aave are already present.

Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony

![aave.png](ipfs://QmbxAKskwg6caRq4j9ogFUA5xUqmHSLmT8WU8mwXbJdg56)

Note: Routers providers are charging 5 bps to complete cross chain transactions.
All outstanding loans are repaid within 60 min (avg 30 min), effectively paying a high interest rate: 0.005% / 60 min → 44% APR

#### Incentives
A Liquidity Mining program might be approved by the DAO once the NEXT token goes live.

175,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Synclub ($SnBNB) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Synclub!

Synclub is a blockchain staking service provider, who has recently launched SnBNB, a yield-bearing liquid staking token (LST) that accrues yield rewards from BNB Staking. 

A few weeks ago, Helio Protocol and Synclub 
**[merged](https://medium.com/helio-money/synclub-io-merger-announcement-a99c9746c11e)** to advance the development of LSTs in DeFi, leveraging Synclub's staking infrastructure expertise and Helio Protocol's LST-backed destablecoin, $HAY. Users can expect enhanced LSTfi offerings, greater accessibility of HAY, and more.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn SnBNB tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 83.18 SnBNB
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 0830 UTC on 28 Jul 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 0830 UTC on 26 Sep 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.00004813 SnBNB

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours of the Syrup Pool.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the Stake CAKE, Earn SnBNB Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing an SnBNB-BNB (0.05% fee tier) v3 farm.


The SnBNB-BNB farm will start with **4x CAKE rewards** for the 60-day period. If the TVL in the Farm picks up, we ask for discretion to increase the farm multiplier appropriately, up to a maximum of 11.5x. The duration and multipliers of the farm may be adjusted to optimize CAKE emissions.

During and at the end of the 60-day period, the Farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### What is $SnBNB?

From the team: “SnBNB is a yield-bearing liquid staking token by Synclub, which appreciates against BNB in line with BNB's staking APR. Users can freely transact with SnBNB or use it across the DeFi ecosystem while earning staking rewards passively.”

176,"RedStone has been an Oracle provider for Venus since July 2023. Currently, their price feeds are integrated by Venus on the BNB Chain and Ethereum (Covered by Venus Stars 1). The aim of this proposal is to help Venus gain further market share and enhance its resiliency.

BACKGROUND

RedStone has enabled the launch of Venus on the Ethereum mainnet by providing XVS / USD price feed, which is the obligatory piece of the deployment on a new chain. RedStone covered the full cost of the price-discovery set-up and monthly maintenance, subsidizing $20,000+ cost to enable the successful launch of Venus on Ethereum and being a long-term partner.

The RedStone team would like to enable Venus expansion on Arbiturm L2 by providing XVS / USD price feed there. Additionally, they would like to further boost Venus’ robustness by delivering needed price feeds to the proprietary ResilientOracle module created by the Venus Core Contributors.

ABOUT REDSTONE

RedStone is the quickest-growing Modular Oracle with clients including Venus, ListaDAO, Kinza, Pendle, Morpho, Ethena, Etherfi, Renzo, Puffer, Silo, Sommelier, Gearbox, Frax, Swell, Angle and 70+ other companies. Our Oracles are available on 50+ chains including Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Merlin Chain, BOB, Blast, TON, Mode and many more.

RedStone’s mission is to enable DeFi protocols and dApp’s builders to reach their full potential with versatile, gas-optimized and robust price feeds delivered cross-chain. Our team consists of seasoned engineers with an average of 15+ years of dev experience and a hard-working BD & Marketing team supporting partner protocols at every step: conferences, Twitter spaces, targeted intros, etc. Our technology has been acknowledged by the leading figures in the crypto space, we are proud to be backed by the most renowned Web3 Entrepreneurs such as Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon), Alex Gluchovski (zkSync), Emin Gün Sirer (Avalanche), Richard Ma (Quantstamp) and VCs like Lemniscap, Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain Capital, Maven11, Distributed Global, Lattice Fund and others.

RedStone's tech-first approach allows them to be a leader in LRT & LST price feeds and provide Oracles for blue chip assets, LP and staked tokens and numerous trending tokens. They are the first oracle to create price feeds for weETH (Etherfi) and ezETH (Renzo), STONE (StakeStone) and numerous other assets that are being integrated into Venus.

PROPOSAL

RedStone is willing to create the XVS/USD price feed on Arbitrum, needed for Venus launch on this L2. They suggest the same configuration as the XVS feed on the Ethereum mainnet, so a 1% deviation threshold and 24-hour heartbeat. Additionally, we have prepared two feeds BNB/USD and BTC/USD on the BNB Chain according to the specs of Venus Core Contributors. They suggest implementing these two feeds as main into the ResilientOracle module alongside Chainlink or Binance Oracle as pivot and fallback, following Venus Core Contributors’ recommendations based on backtest analysis. Such configuration would allow the achievement of the full potential of this module and ensure Venus is protected further against mispricing events during high market volatility conditions.

BENEFITS TO VENUS

By accepting the proposal Venus is going to benefit in a number of ways:

- RedStone would enable the long-awaited Arbiturm deployment.
- Venus’ resiliency on the BNB Chain would be upgraded.
- The RedStone team will support the further cross-chain expansion of Venus.
- RedStone will organize dedicated “Venus campaigns” analogous to the ones with Sommelier 1 and LayerBank allocating RedStone Gems to users of Venus Protocol.
- Assign additional rewards for the Venus Prime holders.
- Ensure Venus Protocol’s eligibility for the future RedStone rewards airdrop. 
- Further supporting Venus on the marketing and Go-To-Market front with new assets.",neutral

188,"**Title**: [ARFC] sDAI Aave V3 Onboarding

**Author**: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs

**Date**: 2023-08-09

**Summary**:

This proposal seeks to onboard sDAI as a collateral-only asset into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. It outlines the specific parameters for integration and aims to create new synergies with the MakerDAO ecosystem.

**Motivation**:

The recent increase in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) to 8%—though anticipated to decrease to 5%—presents a unique opportunity for Aave to forge new synergies with the MakerDAO ecosystem. By integrating liquid DSR deposit tokens (sDAI) as a collateral-only asset in the Aave V3 Ethereum pool, Aave can offer users the dual benefit of earning DSR yield while utilizing their assets as collateral. In the context of GHO, this integration would create a yield-generating stablecoin with a higher yield than the GHO borrow cost. It's important to note that this proposal does not conflict with the [DSR integration in aDAI reserve proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-integrating-makerdaos-dsr-into-aave-v3-ethereum-pool/13360), but rather complements it. However, current engineering constraints make immediate integration difficult in the short-term. Should governance approve this proposal, both sDAI and DAI would serve as reserves in the Aave V3 Ethereum pool, with sDAI primarily used as collateral and DAI as a borrowable asset.

**Specification**:

We propose the following modifications to the Aave V3 & V2 Ethereum pools:

sDAI contract: 0x83F20F44975D03b1b09e64809B757c47f942BEeA

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| wETH Optimal Ratio on V3 | from 80% to 90% |
| wETH slope 1 on V3 | from 4.8% to 3.8% |
| DAI RF on V2 | from 15% to 25% |
| DAI RF on V3 | from 10% to 20% |
| DAI optimal ratio on V3 | from 80% to 90% |
| DAI Slope1 on V3 | from 4% to 5% |
| DAI optimal ratio on V2 | from 80% to 90% |
| DAI Slope1 on V2 | from 4% to 5% |
| DAI stable Borrow | disabled on V2 |
| sDAI parameters | same as DAI but as collateral only |
| LTV | 77% |
| LT | 80% |
| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |

**Disclaimer**:

The Aave-Chan Initiative & Chaos Labs are not affiliated with or paid by MakerDAO to publish this ARFC. At the time of writing, The ACI has large parts of its own treasury in the DSR, intending to use sDAI as collateral to mint GHO.

191,"**Summary:**

> This pool uses the composable stable pool factory and contains two unique staked ethereum tokens, coinbase staked ETH (cbETH) and wrapped staked eth from Lido. 
Staked ethereum expansion has been a strategy for the Balancer protocol due to the yield bearing benefits and supporting as many ""flavors"" of staked ETH as possible is the logical step. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.

**References/Useful links:**

> (cbETH) Link to:
> • [Website ](https://www.coinbase.com/price/coinbase-wrapped-staked-eth)

> • [Documentation](https://blog.lido.fi/)
> • [Github Page](https://github.com/lidofinance)
> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao)


**Protocol Description:**

> cbETH is a Coinbase's staked ETH token, wstETH is a wrapped staked ETH token for Lido.

**Motivation:**

> Balancer is clearly pushing forward on all networks with staked assets as a key focus. By diversifying the staked assets Balancer opens up the door to liquidity providers to gain exposure to multiple providers, while facilitating trade routes for these assets. The protocol benefits greatly from yield bearing assets, and Balancer’s users do just as much. This pool will be a unique and diverse group of Ethereum assets making it exciting for everyone involved.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** [cbETH](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth/whitepaper) whitepaper linked as governance is not applicapable, [wstETH](https://research.lido.fi/).
2. **Oracles:** See each rate provider contract linked here respectively [cbETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7311e4bb8a72e7b300c5b8bde4de6cdaa822a5b1#code) , [wstETH ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768), 
3. **Audits:** See [cbETH](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/coinbase-liquid-staking-token-audit/) , [wstETH](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits).
4. **Centralization vectors:** cbETH is from Coinbase and therefore inherently has centralization risks, read the custodial risk section of the whitepaper [here](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth/whitepaper). For Lido and wstETH please read [here ](https://lido.fi/faq). 
5. **Market History:** See [cbETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/coinbase-wrapped-staked-eth) , [wstETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth)
6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on all assets in the pool and so will LPs. The BIP-19 flywheel will incentivize TVL to grow here with trading volume and our staked ethereum pillars will continue to have Balancer as their ideal liquidity destination.

Technology advancement

new chain technology could would allow the CAKE DEX to do more, including cross chain etc. 

Fees go back to CAKE 

obvious advantages for the CAKE faithful bakers. 

DEX is the future 

this means more Bakers in CAKE more load on the already stressed BSC, it seems inevitable that either the BSC will need to evolve or CAKE needs to evolve a new chain perhaps a new common chain is the answer? however CAKE transactions should generate CAKE fees for CAKE bakers. 

Lower fees

CAKE chain would have the ability to generate fees for CAKE bakers however these fees should be lower than the present BSC chain based in current metrics this is because of both advancement in Bunny technology & the current market price ratio.


 Summary 

I propose CAKE needs to evolve  it's own new chain with the best technology available maybe reach out to leaders in the community & weigh it with security technology to allow the DEX to evolve with cross chain on & off ramps & trading,  CAKE the next level.

This vote is to choose the Cayman Islands Administrator(s) for the APE Foundation.

The available options reflect the service providers who chose to apply for the Request for Proposal (RFP) advertised here: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/request-for-proposal-cayman-islands-administrator-for-the-ape-foundation/11051

This RFP was administered by Working Group Zero (WG0), with support from the ApeCoin Special Council. Via AIP-196, the ApeCoin DAO empowered WG0 to administer the RFP and bring the selection decision to a DAO-wide vote.

The DAO must choose between two new potential APE Foundation Administrators:

- WebSlinger
- Autonomous + Lemma + Provenance

#### WG0 STEWARDS ANALYSIS

Following multiple meetings with all parties and careful consideration of the four proposals received, the WG0 Stewards believe WebSlinger to be the best choice for the next administrator of the APE Foundation. While both groups are competent and accomplished – WebSlinger’s breadth of background, CFO services provided by a global entity, desire to help decentralize DAO operations, and extensive experience in the Crypto / Web3 / DAO environment were the key differentiating factors in our choice.

197,"## Simple Summary

Gauntlet's risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify risk parameters, including Loan To Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across 5 assets on Ethereum v3, Arbitrum v3 and Ethereum v2. For more details, see the full forum post [here]( https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825/1).


## Motivation

These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations and they seek to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, the expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics shown in the [full forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825) can help understand why some parameter recommendations have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for the recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.
For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

## Specification

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at reasonable levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. Our simulations show that we can improve the balance of risk and capital efficiency by making the parameter changes specified below.

Ethereum Aave v3 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|DAI Loan to Value |67%|77%
|USDC Liquidation Threshold|79%|80%
|WSTETH Liquidation Bonus|7%|6%

Arbitrum Aave v3 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|LINK Liquidation Threshold	|75%|77.5%

Ethereum Aave v2 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|SNX Liquidation Threshold|62%|59%

Lowering SNX LT by 3% will liquidate 0xf81c8b55c2499af43ec387977c1d9cb1f1c78bca, who currently has HF 1.02 and supplies $50 SNX to borrow $30 USDT.

## Risk Dashboard
The community should use [Gauntlet’s Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk.

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile insolvency value that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile liquidation volume that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

200,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-v2-authorize-balancer-labs-to-emergency-pause/1798).

The Balancer V2 core smart contracts were deployed to mainnet earlier this week, and the full UI launch is right around the corner. In the final days leading up to the launch, the core dev team at Balancer Labs intends for the Balancer Governance Multisig to execute additional authorizations on chain. But Balancer Labs has no decision-making power over the Multisig, which is strictly governed by BAL holders. 

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable a Balancer Labs EOA to control the system's emergency pause mechanism during its first 3 months.

## Motivation

The Vault and WeightedPool smart contracts have an emergency pause period which is **hardcoded at 3 months** from deployment time. During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. **Funds can always be withdrawn by users**, even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.

Since gathering 6/11 multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also **authorizing a single EOA ([`0x170027069fd114BFF2f57B0FC796df93290C02a6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x170027069fd114BFF2f57B0FC796df93290C02a6)) to pause the system**. The EOA will be controlled by a handful of stakeholders at Balancer Labs across different time zones to ensure short response time. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Multisig nor the EOA will have any pause power; Balancer V2 becomes unstoppable.

## Specification

The Balancer Governance Multisig would submit 2 transactions as follows. Here, ""Multisig"" refers to the Gnosis Safe at `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` and ""Authorizer"" is the smart contract deployed this week at [`0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6#code).

**Title:** [ARFC] Stablecoin Harmonization and Asset Parameters Optimization 
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-01-03

---
## Simple Summary

This ARFC proposes focusing stablecoin collateral usage on USDT and USDC while setting LTV to zero for less-trafficked stablecoins and long-tail assets. The objective is to minimize risk for the protocol, optimize revenue generation, and align with market demand trends.

## Motivation

Aave's revenue primarily comes from wETH borrowing and stablecoins borrowing. Years of User behavior data in DeFi indicates a low demand for fluctuating assets as collateral except in use-case-specific scenarios (LST/LRT loops for Weth, RPL borrow to deploy mini pools). Based on @ChaosLabs  [data](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Ethereum/listed-assets/), only 2.4%, 3.7%, and 5.8% of supplied DAI, USDT, and USDC on Ethereum are being utilized as collateral. We can also note that market demand for alternative stablecoins is less sensitive to borrow rates compared to blue-chip stablecoins like USDT and USDC.


The DAO governance has been lenient in onboarding some collaterals, such as KNC, which currently attracts nearly zero traction (currently used to generate 0.79$ of borrow volume) and generates minimal revenue. Additionally, the asymmetric risk presented by stablecoins, such as during the CRV event (collateral was USDC with very high LT and low LB), highlights the need for optimization considering Risk/reward.

## Specification

### Proposed Adjustments:

The ACI proposes the following strategy shift:

1. Focus on USDT and USDC as primary stablecoin collaterals.
2. Set LTV to zero for alternative stablecoins and long tail assets.
3. Enable a 3%/week LT reduction for these stablecoins assets, providing ample time for users to react and keep them as passive yield sources or borrowable assets that represent 99% of current user demand and most of protocol revenue.
4. Propose the following adjusted standardized ReserveFactor categories for Aave assets:

| Collateral Type | Reserve Factor % |
| --- | --- |
| wETH | 15% |
| USDC/USDT | 10% |
| Alternative stablecoins & long tail assets | 20% |
| DAI | 25% |

5. Fade out as collateral the following stablecoins: 

- FRAX
- LUSD
- EURS
- agEUR
- JEUR
- MAI

6. freeze (if not already), then slowly offboard the following alternative stablecoins and long-tail assets that failed to gain traction by gradually increasing RF to 99.9%, decreasing LT by 3% per week then applying incremental interestRateStrategies incentivizing users to switch to others collaterals or borrowed asset as the DAO implemented for BUSD and TUSD on Aave V2:

| Collateral Type          | Network      |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| EURS                    | All pools     |
| agEUR                   | All pools     |
| JEUR                    | All pools     |
| MAI                      | All pools    |
| KNC                     | Ethereum     |
| STG                     | Ethereum     |
| BAL                     | All pools    |
| FXS                     | Ethereum     |
| UNI                     | Ethereum     |
| WBTC.e                  | Avalanche      |


## Next Steps

1. Community feedback and gather consensus on the proposed adjustments.
2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.
3. If successful, escalate to AIP stage.

**Summary**

>Proposal to add gauge support for the 50WAR-50WETH pool on Mainnet.

**Abstract**

>Our proposal aims to create on chain liquidity for WAR and introduce the first and only WAR/WETH pool on mainnet.

**Protocol description**

>Paladin is a DeFi ecosystem focused on governance protocols and markets, designed to unlock the value of governance. It aims to enable every DeFi stakeholder to participate in governance as they wish, building solutions around governance power. These solutions are designed to strengthen the underlying DeFi protocol by leveraging the token’s voting power or utility while creating value for token holders.

>Paladin’s flagship product, Quest v2, introduces a pioneering method for boosting voting incentives across various DEXs including Balancer and Aura.

>The Autovoter by Paladin optimizes voting incentives for holders of vlCVX, vlAURA, and vlLIQ, offering some of the most competitive yields available for governance tokens.

>Warlord, a novel governance index, allows users to leverage vote incentives within the Convex and Aura ecosystems while automatically managing CVX and AURA positions.

](https://twitter.com/Paladin_vote)

**Motivation**

>WAR, the first governance index token, comprises Convex (CVX) and Aura (AURA), which are vote-locked to generate yield. Previously, the only way to mint WAR was by depositing CVX, AURA, or both, with users receiving WAR directly upon minting. To earn rewards and vote incentive yield, users had to stake their WAR. With the introduction of this Balancer pool, WAR will now be tradable on-chain, offering several advantages. Firstly, it provides a new income stream for those who wish to provide liquidity, and it boosts the yield for those who stake their WAR as the staked ratio decreases. Additionally, offering on-chain liquidity allows users to exit Warlord without waiting in the redeem queue, which can take several weeks depending on the unlock schedule of the vote-locked tokens.

>To provide immediate WAR liquidity, Paladin will use its Aura voting power as well as voting incentives since DEX liquidity for PAL ever since its inception and plans to keep using governance power and PAL bribes with this new pool.

**Specifications**

1. **Governance**: The current Governance of Paladin is composed of a Forum to discuss Proposals, a Snapshot space to vote, and the execution of a vote is currently handled by a Community Multisig where the members are elected through the DAO voting process. The DAO has voted to switch governance to an Optimistic Council ([PIP-23](https://gov.paladin.vote/t/pip-23-switch-governance-to-an-optimistic-council/554/4))
2. **Oracles**: The protocol does not use Oracles.
3. **Audits**: You can find all the audits of the current products [here](https://doc.paladin.vote/deployed-contracts/audits).
4. **Centralization vectors:** Treasury is managed by multi sigs
5. **Market History:** WAR has not market history because it was only possible to acquire some war through a minting process.

## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust four (4) total risk parameters across three (3) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus.


## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These paramater updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations, the latest being [AIP-42: Risk Parameter Updates 2021-10-14](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/42-Qmd8PTDdcq971N6QhLAKBdxN3sjdV5KJqqVw45CaRGRnej).


## Motivation

This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. For more detail on Gauntlet's first two months of recommendations and their impact, please see our [Monthly Risk Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-updates-and-review-october-2021/5887).


## Specification

No significant changes in volatility or liquidity were observed in most assets. However, we would note that the collateral usage of ZRX on Aave almost doubled, so that is an asset that we are monitoring during the upcoming period.


| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| ENJ Liquidation Threshold    | 65%     | 70%     |
| DPI Loan To Value     | 55%     | 65%     |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |
| ZRX Loan To Value     | 65%     | **60%**     |


See below volatility and exchange volume data from 10/14 to 10/21 that were important drivers for the updated parameter recommendations.

208,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal suggests reallocating 10% of the ApeCoin DAO’s available Ecosystem Fund into both Ethereum (ETH) and USDC (USD Coin). These funds will be utilized for various activities related to operating the ApeCoin DAO, facilitating grant requests, and ensuring the financial stability of the ecosystem.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The reallocation of funds into Ethereum and USDC ensures the long-term financial health of the ApeCoin DAO. It provides the following benefits:
* Liquidity for grant requests and ecosystem projects.
* A buffer against market fluctuations.
* Flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.
* Increased confidence among stakeholders.The reallocation of funds into Ethereum and USDC ensures the long-term financial health of the ApeCoin DAO. It provides the following benefits:
* Liquidity for grant requests and ecosystem projects.
* A buffer against market fluctuations.
* Flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.
* Increased confidence among stakeholders.

##### OVERALL COST 
The cost associated with this proposal is limited to 10% of the available ApeCoin in the Ecosystem Fund and the transaction fees for converting funds into Ethereum and USDC. The exact amount of the fees will depend on market conditions at the time of execution, and the fees from any service providers responsible for the execution of this proposal, but are not expected to exceed $200,000.

We request that the ApeCoin DAO administration do their utmost in aiding the Over the Counter (OTC) sale of the coin to mitigate any potential adverse price effects.

209,"As mentioned in a [**tweet earlier today** ](https://twitter.com/PancakeSwap/status/1421412567675596812?s=20), this is the biggest adjustment proposal yet, and while also fulfilling the usual goal of re-directing liquidity to key/high value farms from low liquidity/low volume farms, it will also us to follow up with a proposal for a bigger reduction to emissions without affecting key/high value farms.

I would once again like to reiterate that fact that rewards aren't removed during ajustments, they are just distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

# Prospective Second and Third Year Scope

The DAO may renew the engagement with Aave Labs as a service provider for a technical contributor for a second and third year with that scope of work to be determined at a later date and subject to community input and AFRC approval.

# Grant

$12m GHO, including $3m upfront and $9m streamed over the year.

# Evaluation Metrics

- Monthly reporting of contributions to the Aave DAO.
- Solicitation of feedback from other service providers working as technical contributors and DAO members.
- Direct and transparent engagement with the DAO via the governance forum.

# Principles

- Aave Labs shall strictly adhere to the scope of its designated role as one of the service providers working as a technical contributor, ensuring all decisions and actions remain within our areas of the engagement.
- Aave Labs shall prioritize the security and robustness of its technical contributions.
- Any production-ready code written within the scope of the proposal will be moved to the Aave DAO’s GitHub repository.
- Any written software will be deployed by another Aave DAO service provider specializing in deployments, subject to the Aave DAO’s decision and approval.
- Aave Labs shall engage with the DAO like all other contributors within the established working relationships and procedures of the Aave DAO. For example, decisions concerning risk configurations, DAO treasury, code audits, and other matters not covered by this proposal will need to be separately approved by the Aave DAO via TEMP CHECKs and Snapshots.

# Next Steps

- If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.
- Publication of an ARFC for community feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC Snapshot stage.
- If the ARFC Snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.

**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)


# Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.

# About Jarvis Network
Synthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.

jFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.

The protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.

We have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).

Combined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).

We also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.

jEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.

We debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.

The protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:

- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).
- $78M of volume on our primary market.
- 33k swaps by 9k users.
- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).
- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).
- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.
- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.

# Benefits for Aave V3
### Fiat on and off-ramp
jEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.

We have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).

Having jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.

### Large addressable market
A part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).

### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins
jEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.

### DDM
jEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.

### Low risk collateral
As collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.

jEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.

jEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.


# Risk Parameters
With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:

1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.

# Security specification and risks

### Risks inherent to jEUR
Besides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.

jEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.


[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)


### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.
jEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.

There is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.

It does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.

We have had two different audits by [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) and [Ubik](https://ubikgroup.co/): [Read the audits](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/security)

**Summary:**

Enable gauge on the wUSDR-USDC Stable pool

**References/Useful links:**

• [Documentation ](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/overview)

• [Github Page ](https://github.com/TangibleTNFT)

• [Communities ](https://discord.com/invite/zC4WpKhcj2)

• [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/tangibleDAO)

**Protocol Description:**

Real USD (USDR) is a stablecoin backed by tokenized Real Estate that natively yields 8-10%. It was created by Tangible, a RWA tokenization protocol.

**Motivation:**

Following the successful launch of our Balancer Polygon gauge we're excited to expand to mainnet and reap the benefits of boost, the Aura ecosystem and core pool auto bribes.

We've been accumulating TetuBAL/VeTetu on Polygon and will begin to accumulate AuraBAL, vlAURA and VeBAL on mainnet. 

**Specifications:**

1. Governance: Real USD, the treasury composition and changes to the design will be governed by locked TNGBL token holders, this governance is not yet in place but will be soon. [4 of 5 multisig ](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x100fCC635acf0c22dCdceF49DD93cA94E55F0c71)already required for any changes.
2. Oracles: We have our own oracles for properties at the moment, but are working with Chainlink to get set up, then true property valuations via 3rd party [Hometrack.com ](http://hometrack.com/) can be reflected on chain in Real Time so the treasury values and the collateralization ratio are upto date, this also allows for “minting on gains” to work more effectively in real time.
3. Audits: https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/audits
4. Centralization vectors: The Real Estate obviously exists in the real world as is managed by an entity, Tangible Custody, this entity collects rent and converts to USDC and sends to the rent smart contracts.
5. Market History: In our short time since launch we have not lost peg.
6. Value: Post Shanghai there is a high probability that staked ETH percentage increases, leading to lower yield and therefore revenue on LSD TVL for Balancer. wUSDR has a native yield of circa 10% that scales with market cap, this could be a good source of longterm revenue for Balancer as USDR grows.

Forum post: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-mai-on-aave-v3/7630

Proposal to add support for MAI (aka miMatic) on Aave V3 (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche)

### Summary

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom. It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.

All accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.

There’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.

### Risk Parameters

* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain

### Specifications

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Core team at QiDao Protocol.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

MAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.

MAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.

Despite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.

MAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.

3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
Being the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.

MAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.

MAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.
* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance
* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.

5. How is the asset currently used?

* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)
* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap
* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon
* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM
* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties
* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave

6. Emission schedule

Users can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.

7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

All funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users
There is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences
The multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.
Since the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.

8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

* Market Cap: ~$250M
* 24h Volume: >$40M
* Volatility: Low
* Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose
* Maturity: Launched 5/4/21

* Number of transactions: +3M
* Number of crosschain token holders: 16k+

### Security Considerations

MAI has undergone 2 thorough audits (linked below). Constant internal reviews are performed to ensure MAI’s economic and technical safety.

The protocol currently has around $350M TVL.

217,"The CAKE community has been supportive in reducing emission and increasing token burn (to 15 CAKE recently) but I think that we need to increase APY to create price action in CAKE itself.

Why?

**This is psychological.**

When people see high APY staking, they are more likely to buy CAKE to stake.

If there are low APY rewards for staking, then they'd rather park their money somewhere else.


**APY adjustment is one area Pancakeswap cannot cut down on.**

We need a bigger community, more people to have their legs dipped into the CAKE economy, to grow the size and reach of this platform. To do this, we should continue attracting more people to put their money down, buy CAKE, and leave it locked in through attractive staking rewards.",bearish
218,"I want to raise another potential proposal, that we have the opportunity as CAKE holders to prefarm certain incoming syrup pools or IFOs. Similar to how binance adds projects in their launchpad that can be farmed before the launch I would like to see CAKE holders having similar benefits as BNB holders.

For example currently Mines of Dalarnia can be pre-farmed by staking BNB/BUSD in binance and later will be listed on the exchange and also on Pancakeswap. A partnership with Binance to provide some of the allocation to allow CAKE holders to pre-farm similar to how BNB holders can do would be something very interesting and attractive towards CAKE.

Maybe lets say 1% of total supply can be allocated towards Pancakeswap and farmed for 5-6 days before the token launches. Doesnt have to be binance Launchpool but could also be new syrup pool tokens or other projects that wants to list on PancakeSwap. Similar to how IDOs are done, this can be an alternative IDO/Farming that adds alot value and also gives tons of value towards CAKE holders.

Since Emissions are being reduced and APRs are going down we need innovative and already proven ways to add extra value towards CAKE holders.

Alot of text, but take your time to read and understand the proposal since its a very lucrative and attractive one if it can be made.

For some background on the governance multisig (hereafter referred to as the DAO multisig), you can check out [this section of the docs](https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/governance/multisig). 

## Motivation

Currently the Balancer DAO treasury is controlled by Balancer Labs - handing over direct control to the DAO is a key step in furthering decentralization of our operations.

To be clear, this proposal does not give the DAO multisig any decision making powers. Its sole responsibility is to enact legitimately passed snapshot votes.

The current list of signers is as follows:

Alexander Lange (Inflection)
Ash Egan (Accomplice)
Solarcurve (Baller)
Fabien (Snapshot Labs)
Jake Brukhman (CoinFund)
Kain Warwick (Synthetix)
Mariano Conti (Ethereum)
David Hoffman (Bankless)
Trent McConaghy (Ocean Protocol)
Cooper Turley (Fire-eyes)

Kevin Owocki (Gitcoin) will be retiring as a signer. We thank him for his service!

As part of this proposal a list of replacement candidates has been prepared. In the event a signer wishes to voluntarily leave, someone from this list may be chosen at the discretion of the DAO Multisig as a replacement. Any replacement will be announced in discord and the @Balancer twitter account.

Danielmk (BeethovenX)
Bakamoto (Baller - Head of Liquidity Mining committee)
Zeb (Balancer Grants DAO)
Evgeny Yurtaev (CEO at Zerion)
Hart Lambur (Co-founder at UMA)

Note that BAL holders retain the ability to replace DAO multisig signers at any time and no one can be added as a signer without the approval of BAL holders unless they appear on the above list. Having the candidate list is intended to ease the transition period so operations can continue seamlessly in the event several signers decide to leave abruptly.

Additionally, a stipend of 500 BAL every six months will be payable to DAO multisig signers. They are free to opt out of this if they desire. The stipend will be distributed at the end of each six month period. If a signer leaves before that, they are eligible to receive it prorated. The first period will begin upon the approval of this proposal.

## Specification
If approved, this proposal seeks to transfer control over Balancer DAO’s treasury funds, located at 0xb618f903ad1d00d6f7b92f5b0954dcdc056fc533, to the DAO multisig address 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f. All assets would be transferred by Balancer Labs to this new address.

Additionally, the DAO multisig signers would create a gnosis safe on Fantom to hold Balancer DAO’s allocation of BEETS as part of the recently passed friendly fork proposal. Note that in the future the DAO multisig could operate wallets on other networks as required by future friendly forks or other activities - these would not require governance votes but addresses and activities will always be public and transparent.

Finally, some BAL still remains allocated as part of past Grant waves. Balancer Labs will determine the exact amount but this is the reason not all BAL might be transferred over to the DAO multisig.",bearish

227,"Summary:

dForce proposes to add a dToken pool (dUSDx/dDAI/dUSDC/dUSDT). dToken is a yield aggregator launched by dForce, featured by harvesting the highest underlying yield in the market (USDT 12.1% APY, USDC 6.1% APY, DAI 12.1% APY, as of 31 Aug), as well as gas optimization through a set of strategies that is anticipated to save at least 60% of gas consumption associated (compared to direct interactions with underlying lending protocol for asset supply and sale of governance token mined).
Currently, dToken pool participants can farm DF token by staking through dForce Staking Portal (https://staking.dforce.network/) (mining APY 109% for USDx/USDC on Uniswap), by adding a dToken pool on Curve, LPs could provide liquidity and have the benefit of mining both DF and CRV, (i.e with projected combined yield of 170%), which is a great additional yield incentive to LPs on Curve.

228,"**Proposal**

The following is a proposal for the re-whitelisting of the CREAM<>WETH pool gauge to be found [here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x85370d9e3bb111391cc89f6de344e801760461830002000000000000000001ef).

**Background**

On July 14th 2022, a BIP was presented for voting to the Balancer Community for the “killing of the CREAM gauge” (BIP-28). The majority of veBAL weight voted in favour and, consequently, a transaction to “kill the gauge” was executed by the Balancer DAO multisig. Vote results (**54,88% YES vs. 45,12% NO**) can be found [here](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0xedb78d2d1a7a6d0e28ecac1094840b9a5be0384fcbf7fccbc638229fb9a2ce49).

On July 21st 2022, BIP-30 was also presented to the Community for voting. This time the proposal was to “purge” unused gauges. On the BIP-30 the majority of veBAL voted **against** the implementation with the following voting result: **53,43% NO vs. 46,57% YES**. Voting submission was one of the highest ever recorded with roughly 3M veBAL votes (15 times higher than the quorum).

Despite the high voting participation that should give legitimacy to the result, it was decided to have a Community vote again, on the same topic, without giving any kind of robust rationale that could support the decision. The only reasoning found is the loose statement of a supposed “[wide support of Delegators](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-30-purge-unused-gauges/3478/6?u=andrea81)”. This claim, however, is not backed by any publicly available evidence and does not represent a valid condition for a vote to be reconsidered. Additionally, we would like to remind the Community that neither Delegates nor Gov. Council members have veto powers.

Consequently, on July 28th 2022 (only one week later), the same [vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x3a2cd227ab45ce9773d8f83f876035afc3267f31b6a6de20ee8f58e7cbb7e978) was repeated (among other things using the same BIP number [BIP-30]) and reverted the previous result. 

The event created a historical precedent: the BalancerDAO Governance can disregard (and therefore possibly revert) a legitimate voting result without the need to present any kind of reasonable motivation or display any sort of supporting evidence.

We take this opportunity to point out that there is no indication of what conditions must occur for a vote to be repeated. The only official guidelines (vague and generic) only outline what conditions a Forum Proposal needs to meet so to be voted on Snapshot. This information can be found on the [Governance Process Revamp 2.0](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp-2-0/2548).

**Motivation**

For the reasons expressed above, we request a vote for the reestablishment of the CREAM<>WETH gauge as we believe we face a similar Governance environment/conditions to the examples detailed above: the vote to kill the [CREAM<>WETH] gauge passed with similar margins to the [BIP-30] (Purge unused gauges) and we would like to follow the same *iter* as the BIP-28. We consider the BIP-28 *re-vote* a valid precedent.

**Specification**

We request to have a vote to add back a gauge to the CREAM<>WETH pool.

If the Community votes YES, the BalancerDAO will add a gauge to the [80/20 CREAM/WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x85370d9e3bb111391cc89f6de344e801760461830002000000000000000001ef) pool.

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `grantRole` on the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` with the following arguments:

account: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`

The role can be verified [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json#L394). This will give the DAO Multisig the ability to call `unkillGauge` on a pool’s gauge.

#2
The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the `AuthorizerAdaptor` at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call `performAction` using `0xd34fb267` for the `data(bytes)` argument and `0x9F65d476DD77E24445A48b4FeCdeA81afAA63480` for the `target(address)` argument.

Additional information regarding pool details and original proposal can be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/cream-weth-80-20-gauge/3165).

**Risks**

BalancerDAO Governance has demonstrated a certain degree of unreliability when it comes to vote results/rules/guidelines compliance and the above example should serve as clear evidence.
We expect this proposal to go to a snapshot vote when enough debate has been achieved and feedback received.
The failure to bring this proposal to a vote by any of the members in charge, will be considered a case of Governance Mutiny and consequential actions will be taken.

**Additional notes**

This proposal follows the general guidelines proposed by the Governance Process Revamp 2.0 to be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp-2-0/2548) and intends to follow the additional recommendations specified on [BIP-4](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-4-implement-new-gauge-requirements/3276).",neutral

## Summary

Introduce govFactor, an on-chain voting factor of 1.1 for Balancer Liquidity Providers.

If passed, the govFactor will initially be implemented as a 3 month trial with voter participation acting as the key success metric. 

## Background

🔥_ 🔥 ([FireEyesDAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao)) has been actively working with the Balancer team over the past few months in an effort to develop a robust suite of governance mechanisms to complement the upcoming launch of Balancer V2.

One of the issues we concluded on: consistent voter participation has historically been an issue for many DeFi protocols. Whether it results in proposals not reaching quorum or only having a small number of participants involved, it’s become obvious that protocols need to drive meaningful voter participation across a diverse group of users.

The govFactor creates a simple incentive mechanism for liquidity providers (LPs) to actively participate in governance. 

## Motivation

As it stands, Balancer liquidity mining encourages passive participation. Liquidity Providers (LPs) simply deposit capital into the protocol and earn BAL. Despite the significant subsidy LPs receive in the form of governance tokens, there’s no expectation or requirement that they actively participate in governance.

This ultimately represents a misalignment as LPs have no incentive to vote despite constantly accruing voting weight. If the suppliers are subsidized by the protocol with governance power, they should be willing stewards of the protocol as well.

This does not mean that LPs MUST participate, but instead **they should have an incentive to participate**. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to incentivize those that service the protocol to help govern it as well, aligning their participation with additional weighting to their weekly liquidity mining rewards. 

## Specification

The govFactor is an on-chain voting incentive for LPs that affects BAL liquidity mining allocations depending on whether or not an address voted on the last governance proposal. The implementation multiplies BAL amounts each LP gets by their govFactor (1.1 for those who voted, 1.0 for those who did not) and then normalizes all amounts so that the sum is still 145,000 BAL per week. 

The govFactor will operate as an “on/off” switch where LPs that voted on the most recent proposal by signing a transaction turn “on” the factor.

Providers that did not vote on the last proposal by signing a transaction have their govFactor “off”, forfeiting the factor and in turn, receive lower LP rewards than those that voted on the last proposal. This dynamic will remain “off” until the next on-chain proposal is open for voting and ratified on-chain.

If all LPs vote, then the rewards remain the same as if no one votes.

 **To make calculations as simple as possible, govFactor would be applied after all other factors.**

GovFactor looks at addresses who have voted on the most recent proposal featured on Snapshot and references to see if the address is also providing liquidity to the protocol. If both variables are met, the protocol includes a factor to their weekly BAL liquidity mining allocation.

It’s important to note that this reference happens entirely on-chain, meaning there’s no need to cross-link any addresses to a forum or public username.

Ultimately, the **govFactor creates a unified incentive for those that service the protocol to become active governance participants as well** and should be considered by the community as a simple mechanism for encouraging governance participation from the protocol's supply-side actors.  

## Drawbacks

Some points to consider surrounding the GovFactor:

* The end result could be a lot of non-engaged voting, coming from LPs who don't hold meaningful amounts of BAL (even if being large LPs) and who don't really care about Balancer governance, putting little to no effort in the decision process behind their votes.
* The GovFactor encourages LPs to vote through their liquidity mining address, which could pose some issues for opsec conscious users. However, Snapshot now enables delegation from cold wallets which would mitigate this issue. 
* The cadence between different governance proposals is likely to differ. This means that someone who votes on the last proposal preceding a large time gap to the next proposal may see increased liquidity rewards despite not actively participating in governance discussions.
* The state of Balancer Governance is relatively idle and therefore implementing a governance incentive isn’t currently necessary for the success of the protocol.",bullish

# Proposal Motivation

We [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to facilitate the integration of Uniswap V3 on Rootstock (RSK), the first Bitcoin sidechain. Rootstock combines the security of Bitcoin and the functionality of Ethereum. This amalgam is enabled by RSK’s implementation of a merged mining architecture and an EVM-compatible execution environment. Unlike most deployments during the bear market, RSK has doubled-down on this initiative, allocating a total of $3 million for bootstrapping liquidity across various pools.

What’s more is that the [IOV Labs](https://www.iovlabs.org/) team (the research and development group behind RSK) has been closely collaborating with both [GFX Labs](https://twitter.com/labsGFX) and [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) to ensure that this deployment is completed seamlessly. They have taken all of the necessary technical steps to be eligible for finalizing this deployment. The relevant v3 contracts are now deployed on RSK (see “Deployment Details”), along with pools for trading RBTC (1:1 with $BTC), RIF, and wETH, all accessible using the [Oku Trade front-end](https://oku.trade/app/rootstock/pool/0xd2ffe51ab4e622a411abbe634832a19d919e9c55?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp). This deployment has already aggregated over [$1.1M of TVL](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp) and is seeing[ upwards of $540k in daily volume](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp) over the past two weeks. Plus, the Wormhole integration is in place to facilitate any cross-chain governance messaging. The final hurdle is to officiate this proposal through the Uniswap governance process, and recognize this as the canonical v3 deployment on RSK.

### Introducing Uniswap to the Bitcoin Space

We’ve been in contact with the IOV Labs for the past couple of months regarding this deployment. Our teams have had back and forth conversations regarding the merits and drawbacks of bringing Uniswap to a Bitcoin sidechain, which, admittedly, has limited mindshare among DeFi users across other EVM chains. Currently, there are two divergent user profiles when it comes to Bitcoin. The first is the staunch Bitcoin Maxi. This person views $BTC as the one and true cryptocurrency, with a notable preference for highly secure and isolated systems. Conversely, we have the DeFi users. Most of their activity takes place on the EVM, and their objective is financial gain using various onchain instruments–staking, liquidity provision, borrowing/lending, yield farming, perpetuals, etc. Security is important to everyone, at least idealistically speaking, but users’ actions often indicate a preference for profiteering in the face of taking a degree of risk.

However, we think that there may be a market in between these two that Uniswap–and DeFi protocols in general–could help service. It could very well be the case that users who want to conduct DeFi transactions using $BTC will do so through dapps launched on RSK. The security guarantees using the merged-mining setup make interacting with $BTC on RSK ($RBTC) more secure than using $BTC on alternative smart contract platforms. Although it may be a reaching assumption that users will have the motivation to prioritize security to such an extent, easy access to RSK via wallets like Metamask make it frictionless for users to jump between ETH and RSK. The potential concern here, however, is liquidity fragmentation. That is, unless, a certain market of users exclusively uses RSK for all things BTC.

# A Primer on Rootstock

### Bringing the EVM to Bitcoin

Launched in 2018, RSK is the first Bitcoin sidechain. Generally speaking, a sidechain is an independent blockchain that’s fettered to a parent blockchain. In this case, Bitcoin is the parent chain, while RSK is the sidechain. The sidechain extension typically features aspects that the primary chain cannot support–Ethereum folk are very familiar with functionality separation nowadays due to the multichain and modular nature of EVM-based systems. Bitcoin is naturally more isolated, with a particular focus on sustaining the so-to-speak sanctity of its chain. However, the bare bones nature of Bitcoin means that it cannot support complex applications due to limitations around programmability. So how can this system be improved? Well, Bitcoin itself ideally stays untouched. Its usage as a ledger for an incorruptible store of value is therefore preserved, but it can be complemented with a sidechain like RSK.

**RSK is an EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain**, meaning that it is Turing complete and enables developers to construct a robust ecosystem with close proximity to the Bitcoin blockchain. Specifically, the chain uses the [RSK Virtual Machine (RVM)](https://dev.rootstock.io/rsk/architecture/), which is compatible with the EVM at the op-code level. This is precisely why Uniswap, and alike Ethereum dapps, have the ability to seamlessly deploy on RSK without significant smart contract modifications. Core Ethereum infrastructure, wallets, and tooling (Hardhat, Truffle, Ether.js, Web3.js, etc) also support RSK–so devs can easily migrate to and build on RSK while a user can simply [add RSK](https://chainlist.org/chain/30) to their already running list of chains on Metamask. But a shared execution environment is not enough of a value add. That’s where we must consider RSK’s true value proposition: shared security with Bitcoin.

### Security Before All Else–Merged Mining

Unlike most other blockchains, RSK employs a consensus mechanism known as merged mining, allowing miners to simultaneously secure both Bitcoin and RSK at no extra cost. This results in RSK benefiting from the formidable security and stability touted by Bitcoin. Approximately[ 50% of the current Bitcoin hashrate is involved in securing RSK](https://stats.rsk.co/). In other words, many of the same miners that provide security to Bitcoin are also securing RSK using the same hardware and energy inputs. Some of the largest Bitcoin mining pools like Antpool, Luxor, Braiins, F2Pool, and Binance Pool, have all opted into the merged mining setup.

**What about previous failures surrounding merged mining like CoiledCoin?**
* Rootstock doesn’t implement the traditional merge-mining mechanism used by CoiledCoin–but a more modern protocol with additional security guarantees. This is explained by RSK’s Chief Scientist [here. ](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/modern-merge-mining-f294e45101a0)An in-depth analysis can be found in the Consensus section [here](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/measuring-rsk-security-d169ac03b181). The infamous CoiledCoin attack was performed by a single individual (LukeJr) who could control more than 51% of the blockchain hashrate, which is impossible on Rootstock, and was ideologically motivated because CoiledCoin competed with Bitcoin, something Rootstock does not do. On the contrary, Rootstock provides additional value to Bitcoin. Rootstock talks have been given at Bitcon [conferences](https://baltichoneybadger.com/) without opposition of any kind. The same individual that attacked CoiledCoin has a positive opinion regarding Rootstock and a neutral opinion on the sidechain’s hashrate escrows.

### Two-way Proof of Work Peg (PoWPeg)

Rootstock does not have its own token nor inflation-based incentives. The way Bitcoin and RSK are connected is via a two-way peg using $BTC. A user deposits their $BTC in the RSK bridge, which, in turn, mints the rBTC on the RSK network. Both assets will always have a 1:1 ratio, and the max amount of mintable rBTC is the same as the max BTC supply of 21M. Hence, the main asset that the entire RSK ecosystem relies on is, at the end of the day, $BTC. RSK mining rewards are paid out to miners solely through transaction fees in the form of $rBTC.

Typically, if a PoW chain relies solely on rewarding its miners with txn fees, and if that chain has low volume, it would be subject to a 51% attack. This issue, however, is subverted under a shared security system like merged mining. No matter how low the volume falls, the network will remain steady because the reliance is entirely on the security of Bitcoin. Sure, one could argue Bitcoin itself could face fragility if txn fees and incentives simultaneously become too low–however, it is an unlikely case since the adoption of $BTC is so pervasive that many large parties are incentivized to secure the system even if it's at a capital loss. Plus, innovations like [inscriptions continue to sustain momentum for Bitcoin’s usage](https://messari.io/report/bitcoin-brief-runes-grayscale-and-microstrategy?referrer=research-reports).

# Bitcoin Ecosystem Catalysts

If we analyze the previous points about the robust security and EVM compatibility of RSK, it’s clear how there may be an untapped market here for Uniswap to enter. Bitcoin, relative to the rest of the crypto market, is to a degree, isolated. The adoption of Bitcoin has been far more prominent around the world relative to other cryptocurrencies, even becoming [legal tender in countries like El Salvador](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/pdf/el-salvadors-law-a-meaningful-test-for-bitcoin.pdf). The US regulatory environment, though constrictive to most cryptocurrencies, [has been significantly more amenable to Bitcoin](https://watcher.guru/news/secs-gary-gensler-says-bitcoin-is-not-a-security).

In the past year alone, Bitcoin has taken tremendous mindshare among both investors and users. A series of BTC Spot ETF filings were released in July as [Blackrock led the pack](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/spot-bitcoin-etf/). And August saw [Grayscale secure a vital victory against the SEC](https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit), as the appeals court denied the SEC’s attempt to deny GBTC’s conversion to an ETF. On the user side, inscriptions dominated the Bitcoin landscape, bringing another creative use case to the seemingly latent chain. Although ordinal (non-fungible) & BRC-20 (fungible) inscription volume peaked earlier in the year, they have since sustained a large degree of their momentum, with [average daily inscription mints increasing by 48.1% in Q3](https://messari.io/report/state-of-bitcoin-q3-2023). The large Bitcoin fee uptrend can also be attributed the inscriptions rush.

RSK is also taking advantage of these advancing narratives. Through [RSKIP-387](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP387.md), Bitcoin ordinals and inscriptions are looking to become available on RSK using the Powpeg bridge. In terms of projects, IOV Labs is [funding](https://rootstock.io/grants/) more than 5 ordinals-based projects that came out of the HackerEarth Ideathon + Hackathon.

# Liquidity Bootstrapping

Rootstock will commit $3M Rootstock-based tokens in Uniswap-specific liquidity. The tokens will be deployed on Uniswap through the Rootstock integration with Oku, the funds will be provided by IOV Labs. They will work to deploy the funds as follows:

* 1st Phase - Deployment: up to $400k into four liquidity pools for the following:
  * $100k in RIF/RBTC
  * $100k in RIF/rUSDT
  * $100k in RBTC/rUSDT
  * $100k in RIF/wETH

* 2nd Phase - Growth: up to $1M to be distributed in the previous four liquidity pools created in the 1st Phase.
  * The amount to be added into the liquidity pools will be decided according to the trading volume growth in a period of 3 months for each pool.

* 3rd Phase - Expansion: up to $2M to be used in order to create new liquidity pools and token pairs.
  * IOV labs will create new liquidity pools according to market demand. These new liquidity pools will be a minimum amount of $100k.

The goal is to deploy the $3M within 12 months in several phases. While the proposed limit is $3M, IOV Labs may increase this amount based on the outcome and success of this initiative.

Track active pools, TVL, volume, and fee metrics via [Oku’s RSK analytics page](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp).

# Success Criteria

Overall, we propose the transparent measurement of this project’s success through the following success criteria and long-term goals:

* At least a 30% increase in TVL across all initial pools during 2024, excluding the liquidity provided by IOV Labs
* At least a 100% increase in average RSK DEX trading volume across all initial pools in the first six months after the onchain proposal
* Successful adoption of Uniswap by the Rootstock community, aiming for a >20% increase in the number of active users by end of Q1 2024
* Continuous and sustainable maintenance of the Uniswap-RSK integration contract, ensuring optimal operation and long-term security

# Deployment Details

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the below Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on RSK. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on RSK.

237,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Back Seedify ($SFUND) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a Syrup Pool with Seedify! Seedify is an incubator and launchpad for blockchain games, NFT projects, and metaverse related projects.

#### What is Boost?

Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $SFUND tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 185,200 SFUND
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 22 Aug 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 21 Oct 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.1071 SFUND

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the SFUND Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a SFUND-BNB farm.  

The farm will have **1x CAKE rewards** for the first 48 hours, then **0.5x CAKE rewards** thereafter.

At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1200 UTC on 21 Oct 2022 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0.1x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.5x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues etc. 

#### What is $SFUND?

From the team: “SFUND is the main utility token of the Seedify ecosystem. Through staking or farming SFUND, users become eligible for Seedify’s IGO (Initial Game Offering) and INO (Initial NFT Offering) allocations; users can also gain seed staking points to earn tokens from Seedify incubated projects.”


#### To learn more, visit the project’s official channels:
- **Website:** https://launchpad.seedify.fund/        
- **Twitter:** https://twitter.com/SeedifyFund/
- **Telegram Announcements:** https://t.me/seedifyfund
- **Telegram:** https://t.me/seedifyfundofficial
- **Medium:** https://blog.seedify.fund/

#### How do you stake CAKE to earn $SFUND rewards?

Follow this guide to staking in Syrup Pools:
  
**https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/syrup-pool/syrup-pool-guide**

#### **⚠️⚠️⚠️BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING⚠️⚠️⚠️**

The official $SFUND token contract address on BNB Chain is:

**https://bscscan.com/token/0x477bc8d23c634c154061869478bce96be6045d12**

​Any other $SFUND token will be a scam. Always verify the token address before buying tokens. If you receive a $SFUND token airdrop from another address, it’s probably a scam, and we advise you to ignore them.",neutral

**Summary:**
> This pool uses the new weighted pool factory which allows us to apply the protocol fee to yield bearing tokens. This gauge would enter as a ""core pool"" under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.

**Protocol Description:**

> wstETH is liquid staked ETH. COMP is the governance token for Compound. 

**Motivation:**

> Request of master humpy

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Find more information about governance on Lido's [forum](https://research.lido.fi/).   

2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on a rate provider for wstETH which Balancer has been using already for awhile. See [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768).

5. **Market History:** See [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao). 
 
6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on wstETH yield. By paring with wstETH we encourage more wstETH trading activity and since wstETH/ETH is one of our largest pools, any increase in trading activity will make wstETH liquidity even more profitable for us.

### Summary

Vote on whether or not the Balancer protocol should extend the [govFactor](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer/proposal/QmWtk4pJ2CNhmLFK9Nhk5gGD7xr2KbsK4cfpFXyR9YCbYG) and keep it in perpetuity for Balancer V1 liquidity mining.  

### Motivation

The govFactor was initially implemented as a trial to test voting incentives for the Balancer Protocol. The trial was successful as voter participation increased substantially across the board for all Snapshot Proposals. 

For reference, the three most recent proposals prior to the govFactor vote averaged 91,000 BAL (~0.53% of circulating supply) compared to the three most recent proposals today which averaged 1.2M BAL (~7.0% of the circulating supply) in tokenholder participation.

With the upcoming transition to Balancer V2, **there are no factors.** Therefore, the govFactor will not be implemented in V2 liquidity mining. 

This proposal aims to identify whether or not the Balancer protocol should keep the govFactor in perpetuity for V1 liquidity mining. 

## Specification 

The govFactor is a 1.1x factor applied to the adjusted liquidity--the liquidity measured in USD terms after all other factors have been applied--of V1 LPs who voted on the most recent Snapshot proposal(s). 

For more information on the govFactor and how it works, please read the [original Snapshot proposal here](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer/proposal/QmWtk4pJ2CNhmLFK9Nhk5gGD7xr2KbsK4cfpFXyR9YCbYG).",bearish

Title: [ARFC] Set ACI as Emission Manager for Liquidity Mining Programs 
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-06

---

# **Summary**

The current ARFC proposes to appoint the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) as the Emission Manager for liquidity mining programs across Aave markets. This will enable ACI to manage incentive programs funded by different partners, with the purpose of stimulating market activity and growth.

# **Motivation**

Liquidity mining programs are essential for attracting liquidity providers by offering rewards for their participation. Effective management of these programs is crucial for the sustained growth of the Aave Ecosystem. Therefore, ACI, with its extensive experience and strategic partnerships, is well-positioned to manage these emissions effectively.

A recent example is the [Long Term Incentive Program (LTIPP)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aave-ltipp-application-final/21741) from Arbitrum DAO, where Aave DAO will receive 750,000 ARB tokens, illustrating the benefits of coordinated emission management.

# **Specification**

1. Appointment of ACI as Emission Manager for Liquidity Mining Programs
    1. ACI will be authorized to manage Emission Programs for Liquidity Mining across Aave Markets.
    2. ACI’s multisig address will be the one receiving and distributing emissions on behalf of the DAO.
2. Appointment of ACI as coordinator with ecosystem partners, to define and implement emission strategies, managing the distribution of rewards to liquidity providers, and monitor & adjust emissions based on market performance.
3. Integration of Liquidity mining program as part of “Dolce Vita” service of the ACI at no extra cost for the DAO.

# Implementation

The ACI multisig address will be set as the emission manager via the **`setEmissionAdmin()`** method in the relevant emission manager contracts.

ACI multisig address: 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd

This method will appoint the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) wallet as the emissions admin for all potential Liquidity Mining Programs.

# Disclaimer

The ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.

# Next Steps

1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.

#### Summary

The purpose of this proposal is to kill five* gauges which are currently not being utilized due to dead ends with partnership initiatives. The five* pools are the TWAMM rETH/wstETH on Mainnet, OHM/LUSD on Mainnet, cbETH/wstETH on Mainnet*, DFX/WETH on Arbitrum, and ACID/WETH on Arbitrum. These gauges have been active for several weeks and have received little to no votes. Killing these gauges keep our UI and system cleaner overall.

#### Motivation

The TWAMM rETH/wstETH gauge is proposed to be killed at the request of the Cron Finance team. The other 4* gauges serve no purpose to veBAL holders or Balancer users based on utilization. Removing them is a house cleaning in terms of UX and safety. 

#### Specification: 

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptorEntrypoint at `0xf5dECDB1f3d1ee384908Fbe16D2F0348AE43a9eA` and call performAction using `0xab8f0945` for the `data(bytes)` argument and the “Root Gauge Address” list for each pool below will be used for the `target(address)` argument.

246,"title: Aave V3 Harmony - Freeze Reserves
status: Proposal
author: 3SE Holdings

Simple Summary
This ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmony’s Horizon Bridge.

This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts.

Motivation
The Aave DAO Community, through the governance forum, has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users, Protocol, and DAO. (Harmony Horizon bridge exploit. Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1

This proposed action is a first step that will protect users.It will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue, by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop.

Specification
If passed, this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze() function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony. In addition, passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change (disabling supply and borrow) as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony.",bullish

#### Proposal to Launch veCAKE Gauges System on Linea

As mentioned in our initial [**veCAKE proposal**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), we are launching veCAKE in phases, and are excited to share the next deployment - Linea!

#### Recap: Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

Here’s a quick recap of veCAKE’s utility:

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders can directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE Managers, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE emissions. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
#### Inclusion of Linea in the veCAKE Gauges System

With the inclusion of Linea, the current **Trading Allocation** emission of ~125 CAKE/day directed towards Linea Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions. 

As voted for previously, the Kitchen will retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs, such as USDC-ETH on Linea. This is to maintain the liquidity depth and volumes of these core pairs, which contribute significantly to CAKE buyback-and-burn.

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE will be launched shortly on Linea.",neutral

253,"### Summary

This proposal aims to **establish Balancer Grants DAO, an independent community-owned grants program for the Balancer ecosystem.** The program aims to accelerate the development of the BAL ecosystem while optimizing contributor rewards in the Balancer ecosystem. **The requested budget for the first cycle (3 months) is 25,000 BAL, 80% of which will be allocated to grantees, as visualized in the breakdown below.** A learnings and review document will be created at the end of the cycle, and any unspent resources will be sent back to the BAL treasury.

The initial Balancer Grants team has already worked together for the past 4 weeks to create the basic grant framework and community channels - check it out here:[ https://balancer.community/](https://balancer.community/)

This is a synthesized version of the proposal. You can read the full text [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-establish-the-balancer-grants-dao-and-coordinate-the-next-wave-of-balancer-community-grants/2095). 

### Background

Grants and contributor rewards are important mechanisms for coordinating resources and developing ecosystems. Multiple large blockchain projects and DAOs have dedicated grant programs with varying success. Balancer hosted and ran its own grants through grants[ wave 1](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/why-the-balancer-community-received-over-1m-in-grants-434c9cab3908) and[ wave 2](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/batch-2-of-balancer-ecosystem-fund-grants-is-now-available-c6b1bf567483). The grants have attracted various resources and developers to the Balancer ecosystem but have recently slowed down.

The grants program has been hampered in its growth due to the over-reliance on the foundation team. This has meant there has been a lack of resources, tooling, and support for existing grantees. Additionally, the resource constraint has meant slow turnaround and suboptimal user experience for those who may join the ecosystem.

This is a part of the Balancer ecosystem that deserves more attention and with the right planning it can start to shine.

The grants committee has researched over 15 blockchain grants programs to get a clear overview of what an effective program looks like. We will combine multiple aspects of successful programs with original ideas from the grants committee and valuable feedback from the Balancer Labs team and community.

### PROPOSAL

We propose a rework of the current grants program by establishing the Balancer Grants DAO, a community-operated grants DAO dedicated to developing the Balancer Ecosystem.

The grant program provides support and funding ($5K - USD 75K, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem.

The Balancer Grants DAO will initially be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee can be found further in this proposal.

#### How the Grant review process will look

At Balancer, we want our applicants to feel heard and supported, not only financially. That is why we want this process to be as clear as possible. During the evaluation, the Grant Committee looks at the reasonable viability of the applications and does due diligence on the team. The evaluation process takes about 2 weeks.

If the application is successful, the team will be contacted, further steps will be discussed, and they will be connected with a mentor for regular calls to keep up to date and provide support. It is expected that this is reciprocated by grantees through operational transparency, high developer velocity, active repositories and frequent communications towards us.

### Grant Milestone Review

Balancer Grants will work with milestone based payouts. These milestones are clear and reasonable targets based on the communication between the grantees and the Grant Committee.

Grantees are encouraged to map their deliverables and timeline. We have provided a GANNT style template that grantees can use here:[ Project GANNT](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17EMQk0fYKbNsNzb6R21tLDPaHzBkX0K8cRO4MGgx19U/edit?usp=sharing)

Rewards Grants are awarded in BAL tokens, based on predefined installments. Such installments are subject to a payment schedule to ensure that predefined milestones are achieved, and the first milestone can be prepaid. If a Grant application is larger than 75K USD, the project will have to be split into multiple Grant applications. The grants can be priced in either USD or BAL value, to be selected by the grantee at the start of the grant. If a grantee decides to price their reward in USD, 50% of the grant’s value will be converted from BAL to a stable asset to reduce market risk for the Balancer Grants DAO.

The Balancer Grants Committee controls payments and assesses milestone reports from grantees before follow-on payments. The Balancer Grants Committee may decide not distribute all follow-up payments for projects that do not hit their deliverables.

### Risks Analysis and Mitigation

- How does the Balancer Grant DAO ensure that grants contribute meaningfully?

To ensure that the Balancer Grants are allocated in line with the needs of the Balancer Ecosystem, an[ Ecosystem Assessment form](https://hi704760.typeform.com/to/lLmGUEEb) has been created by the Balancer Grants DAO and sent to 10 active contributors of the Balancer ecosystem operating in different areas to get a full picture of the current needs of the ecosystem. The results will be summarized by the Balancer Grants DAO and discussed during a to be organized open workshop.

- What happens if there are not sufficient quality grant applications?

All leftover grant funds get sent back to the BAL treasury in low participation or not enough quality applications.

- What if grants apply but do not deliver?

Although this is a common issue within all grant systems, we can mitigate this risk by providing mentoring and support. This will be one of the defining aspects of our approach—something that is often overlooked. Additionally, payments are always based on Milestones, limiting the potential resources lost when a grantee cannot deliver.

### Specification

255,"# Motivation

As some have noticed, the [CREAM/WETH gauge](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/cream-weth-80-20-gauge/3165) we recently approved has been allocated over 40% of BAL emissions. In concert with that, the swap fee on the pool has been set to 10%. This has exposed a hole in our gauge requirements that should be remedied for all past and future gauges. By setting the swap fee to 10% they are attempting to prevent trading in the pool in order to passively farm BAL rewards. 

* For each gauge, the underlying pool's owner must be set to Balancer Governance. If this is not the case, a very good reason must be presented in the gauge proposal

* If Balancer Governance is not the owner, any proposed change to the swap fee must be communicated to Balancer's community in the #swap-fee-and-amplification channel in Balancer's discord. This must be done at least 24h in advance of the change being made and the change can only be made if the Ballers (Balancer community contributors) are in favor.

Failure to adhere to these guidelines for existing gauges where the owner is not Balancer Governance will open the possibility for the [Emergency subDAO](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197) to kill the gauge at their discretion if they believe the swap fee change to be malicious (causing liquidity to be unusable). 

# Risk

* The actor(s) performing these malicious actions together likely have enough voting power to vote down this proposal on snapshot. If they do that, I would petition the Emergency subDAO to kill the gauge and classify this as a governance attack. Up to the other six members if they agree with that assessment or not.

# Paragraph summary
We would like to ask for your support in listing RSR (Reserve Rights Token) as an asset to borrow. RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both (a) insures and (b) governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol.

# Motivation
The Reserve team is launching the Reserve protocol in fall of 2022. From that point on, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token will serve the purpose of (a) insuring and (b) governing stablecoins created on the Reserve protocol (RTokens).

The Reserve protocol [GitHub - reserve-protocol/protocol](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/) is building on Aave by (a) integrating aTokens as collateral and (b) using the protocol oracle to determine price during valuation and auction functions (if listed on Aave as borrowable asset).

We would prefer to use the Aave oracles for the simplicity of our protocol’s design and the code has already been included in our ongoing audit. To do so, this requires RSR to be a borrowable asset on Aave.

When RSR is staked on a particular Reserve stablecoin (RToken), it may receive a portion of income from the respective RToken’s full collateral basket. Because of this, we anticipate demand to borrow RSR in order to stake or hedge staked positions. Aave would be the only platform where this would be possible as of now.

# Specifications
## Link between the author & the project: 
The Reserve team
## High level overview of the project: 
The mission of the Reserve project is to help people cope with the effects of high- or hyperinflation and aims to eventually eradicate it. The project does this by developing (a) stable+(**) cryptocurrencies, (b) a mobile application to exchange local currencies with the stable+ cryptocurrencies and (c) a protocol that insures & governs them.
 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiaxl7iig3h3eceftb6qulbqugv52vmwndiv6da44y7zb6lrre6ole)
The Reserve app is currently available in Latin American countries where hyperinflation has had the most significant impact: Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia & Panama. It currently has >600,000 registered users and ~120,000 weekly app visitors who use the Reserve stablecoin(s) for daily purchases such as paying for groceries, paying bills, etc. This video shows how some of our customers use our stablecoin daily (https://tinyurl.com/mudrhh4d).

The Reserve Rights (RSR) token is the governance token used to insure the stable+ cryptocurrencies against collateral defaults, and while staked, is also used to govern the RTokens (collateral changes, etc).

A key point is that when RSR is staked on a particular RToken, it will typically (% determined by governance) receive a portion of the income of the entire RToken’s collateral.

(**) We define an asset as stable+ if it never depreciates, and generally appreciates over time, relative to its backing asset(s).

## Why would RSR be a good borrow asset?
We anticipate that the yield on stRSR will drive demand to borrow RSR for two primary purposes: (a) to hedge against price changes on an existing stRSR position and (b) to borrow with intent to stake for the stRSR yield.

These are both well known strategies in DeFi and TradFi, and we don’t expect that to be any different with RSR. Furthermore, we have received a significant amount of requests from our community, but have delayed on making this request until we were closer to launching our platform.

Aave would be the first and currently, only, place to borrow RSR in DeFi and as a result, we anticipate there to be demand.

By listing RSR as a borrowable asset, Aave would become the first DeFi protocol that allows borrowing RSR and could therefore benefit from the borrowing demand from the RSR community and potentially other parties.

## Brief history of the project’s components
The main relevant components of the Reserve ecosystem are the Reserve mobile app and the Reserve Protocol.

The Reserve app has been fully open access to users in the aforementioned countries since September 2021. The full version of the Reserve protocol will be live sometime in 2022. We anticipate this happening in the early Fall, although as with all development work, this could be a bit sooner or later.

An initial concept of fully collateralized stablecoins was launched in 2019, and since then the team has been working on the fully decentralized and permissionless platform that will allow for the creation of fully collateralized, yield bearing, and insured stablecoins. Full details on this updated version can be found here: [Protocol description - Reserve](https://reserve.org/protocol/2021_version/).

## How is the asset currently used?
At this point in time the Reserve Rights (RSR) token serves as a placeholder token. From this year onward, the token will be used for two main purposes:
1. RSR holders can stake their RSR on any Reserve stablecoin (RToken) to insure it against default of one of the collateral tokens and in return, may receive a portion of the yield generated by the collateral backing RTokens.
2. RSR holders can govern Reserve stablecoin to help decide on its future (e.g. collateral assets, back-up assets, locking periods, etc).
## Emission schedule
The total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens, out of which there are currently 18.3b in circulation. The remaining 81.7b RSR tokens are locked. Out of these, 49.4b tokens belong to the Slow Wallet, 15.5b to seed investors and strategic partners and 16.8b to team members and advisors.

The [Slow Wallet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70?a=0x6bab6EB87Aa5a1e4A8310C73bDAAA8A5dAAd81C1) is a locked wallet controlled by the Reserve project, used to fund RToken adoption initiatives like listings, partnerships, marketing, etc. It’s under the discretionary control of the Reserve team. However, it has a hard-coded 4-week delay after initiating each withdrawal transaction on the blockchain. Upon initiating a withdrawal transaction, the team announces the purpose of the withdrawal either through a public on-chain message or on social media. If RSR holders do not agree with the purpose of the withdrawal, they are able to sell their RSR in the 4-week period before the project is able to sell what they have withdrawn. The team can only access these withdrawn tokens after those 4 weeks.

More details here: [Release schedule](https://reserve.org/protocol/rsr_release_schedule/#main-content)

## Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?
The total supply of RSR cannot be changed. RSR did migrate from a V1 contract in the past, and some RSR has not completed the migration yet. The only minting that occurs is from migration (which does not impact total supply).

The contract is un-upgradeable, however it is pausable. The pauser is set to the [Reserve team multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xA7b123D54BcEc14b4206dAb796982a6d5aaA6770/home), a 3-of-5 safe. Pausing will only be done in situations where the token or platform is in danger. Once the platform has reached steady state, the team intends to release pausing to a burn address.

# Reactivation

Hi! On behalf of the GnosisDAO, I'd like to reactivate the discussion so we can rerun the vote to **increase the GNO cap from Cap3 to Cap4 ($10M -> $30M)**

As @rabmarut stated:

- There is currently ~$19M worth of GNO in Balancer pools, making it the most liquid DEX for GNO

- Raising the cap would further incentivise liquidity, which is beneficial for both GnosisDAO (people can acquire the token in larger amounts) and Balancer (more trading volume) 

- This would further strengthen our synergies for a collaboration around GPv2 Meta-DEX Aggregator and Balancer

- GnosisDAO has committed to not selling BAL in the market and will instead hold the tokens in order to be an active governance participant

Looking forward to get the voting started once more!

# Original

**TL;DR**

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). GNO adjusted liquidity has been consistently greater than $10m since December 2020.

**The Proposal**

This is a proposal to increase the GNO cap tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M).

At the time of writing GNO has over $22M in total liquidity on Balancer Pools, and has thus surpassed its $10M cap.

Gnosis hopes to further strengthen synergies with Balancer in light of the upcoming launch of Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator. V2 channels orders to underlying on-chain AMMs for execution and hopes to be integrating Balancer as one of its first partners.

As Gnosis has contributed liquidity for multiple Balancer pools, Gnosis currently holds 52,146 BAL. Gnosis holds and continues to earn a significant amount of BAL tokens which it intends to transfer to GnosisDAO to hold as an investment, instead of selling in the open market.

[Balancer is currently the most liquid exchange for GNO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gnosis) and it would be good to keep incentivizing it to avoid the fragmentation of its liquidity. The GNO token migration to other exchanges could potentially reduce Balancer’s competitive advantage of having the lowest fee and slippage for GNO/ETH pairs.

**What is GNO?**

GNO is the governance token of [GnosisDAO](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosisdao-a7102fcf9224), which launched Nov 23rd 2020 and has since seen significant growth in community engagement. It currently has a $164M market cap.

GnosisDAO owns several core Ethereum infrastructure components such as the Gnosis Safe which currently holds [more than 2% of the total ETH supply](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/ul0PgNtcq9MwezZThlHrgOMEIzpvEmkdwA9XoVqi). GnosisDAO will soon launch Gnosis Protocol V2, a Meta Dex-Aggregator that channels liquidity to on-chain AMMs such as Balancer.",bearish

title: [ARFC] Gas Rebate for Recognized Delegates
author: @lbsblockchain, @MarcZeller Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
created: 2023-05-31
---

## Abstract

This ARFC introduces a mechanism for reimbursing gas fees to recognized delegates who vote on-chain on Aave.

## Motivation

As Ethereum gas fees continue to rise, the cost of on-chain governance for delegates has proportionally increased. This ARFC proposes a rebate system for these gas fees, aiming to incentivize active engagement and cultivate a more diverse voter base.

Rebating delegates for their participation offers several benefits:

- Encourages more active engagement from the delegate community by eliminating the disincentive to vote, leading to better decision-making for Aave.
- Fosters a more diverse voter base, including student organizations, by reducing the barrier to entry for voting. This creates a more open and collaborative delegate ecosystem, driving participation.
- Helps retain top delegates to foster the growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being an excellent Aave delegate should not result in a net cost to the delegate due to ever-increasing gas costs.
- Can be achieved at a relatively low cost. We also propose measures to reduce the administrative burden for Aave.

## Specification

### Claiming Process

Every quarter, an ARFC will be proposed (with the current one being the first) to publish an AIP reimbursing gas fees spent by recognized delegates.

These gas fees are determined by an open-source script written by @JosepBove, which allows anyone to generate a JSON file of recognized delegates' gas spending.

This script can be run and verified by any community member to approve the amounts distributed to recognized delegates.

Once a consensus has been reached on an ARFC, an appointed Governance Facilitator will submit an AIP to transfer aWETH to the delegate's address. We initially propose that the Aave Chan Initiative serves as the Governance Facilitator.

### Gas Rebate Token

We propose that the Gas Rebate Token be wETH.

## Proposed reimboursement

here's the output of the script for the previous quarter, covering AIP-165 until AIP-236 and Ethereum blocks from `16726166` until `17343620`:

Balancer Boosted Pools are a tremendous innovation in the AMM space. Many teams and protocols are eager to adapt the Boosted Pools and take advantage of their efficiency for their own unique use cases and needs. The bbaUSD pool currently sits at $350mm.

Boosted Pools have yet to be integrated by the aggregators and as such the liquidity in these pools is not being efficiently utilized by the market. This proposal aims to fund the integration of Boosted Pools in the 1inch aggregator.

Given that this is a new pool type and requires effort from 1inch Labs, BalancerDAO, through this proposal, would fund this integration via a payment of 20,000 BAL (or equivalent in stablecoins) to 1inch Labs.

### Specification

As outlined in the proposal on the [1inch Forum](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1ip-07-integrate-balancer-boosted-pools-in-the-1inch-aggregation-protocol/3096):

1. 1inch Labs shall integrate the Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API.
2. The integration shall be live on the Ethereum main-net no later than 3 weeks after this proposal passes the Phase-4 snapshot vote.
3. If both conditions 1 and 2 are met, Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will transfer 20k BAL or the equivalent in stablecoins (as determined by Balancer DAO) to 1inch Labs.

The integration of Boosted Pools requires support for linear pools math, order routing and support for BatchSwaps. 1inch’s support for BatchSwaps would generally benefit the Balancer protocol by decreasing the cost of multihop swaps even outside of Boosted Pools.

This grant is contingent on the same proposal passing through the 1inch DAO.

Upon satisfactory integration, 20,000 BAL shall be sent to 1inch Labs ETH address: 0x2DF104682A61241C79eBB3ce3b2C293578bF6A9D

As outlined on the adjacent proposal, satisfactory integration is defined as the 1inch Aggregation Protocol accurately forwarding trades through the bbaUSD and the bbfUSD pools, on Ethereum main-net, when those pools offer the optimal pricing for the end-user.

## Rationale

The vast majority of trade volume on the Balancer protocol is driven by DEX aggregators. Among the aggregators, 1inch drives a very significant portion of the volume. As such, adoption and integration of Boosted Pools by aggregators is imperative for the success of the Boosted Pools.

I encourage the DAO to ratify this grant and fund the integration of Boosted Pools in the 1inch aggregator.",bearish

This AIP provides for $165,000 USD (which includes a 10% contingency) to fund a marketing initiative to increase awareness of Ape Coin.

Imagine cheering for the ApeCoin sponsored race car in a nationally televised race! I want to bring ApeCoin to the NASCAR racing community. This can be accomplished in February 2023 during the most visible week of racing — at the World Center of Racing, Daytona International Speedway. We will involve the ApeCoin community by holding a contest to custom design a fully digital ApeCoin vinyl wrap for the 200 mph race car! That’s right, the ApeCoin community will design the look of the race car! The winner (and companion) will receive airfare, accommodations, Pit Road Patio Suite credentials to the race (The Lucas Oil 200) and infield/garage credentials to meet the team and the ApeCoin race car prior to the race. ALL members that vote for this initiative will be eligible to join us at Daytona and watch the race from the Pit Road Patio Suite (thats right behind the race teams on pit road)! We will have a random drawing for up to 35 members to join us and support the ApeCoin race car! The goal of this funding is to increase awareness and adoption of ApeCoin.

#### OVERALL COST

Total cost will be $165,000 USD (which includes a 10% contingency). This includes: all transportation, testing and racing costs, digital vinyl wrap, fan base marketing outreach at the track, marketing personnel, giveaways, Pit Road Patio Suite for the ApeCoin community, ApeCoin display race car and operation costs.

#### Proposal to Launch veCAKE Gauges System on zkSync

As mentioned in our initial [**veCAKE proposal**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), we are launching veCAKE in phases, and are excited to share the next deployment - zkSync!

#### Recap: Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

As a quick summary, here’s quick recap of veCAKE, with the following utilities:

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders will be able to directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE managers and bribe markets, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE rewards and receive voting incentives for doing so. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to automate their voting and potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
#### Inclusion of zkSync in veCAKE Gauges System

Currently, the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum is **~0.99 CAKE/block**.  

With the inclusion of zkSync, the current **Trading Allocation** emission of 0.0131 CAKE per block directed towards zkSync Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions. 

As part of the voting gauges design, the Kitchen proposes to retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs, such as ETH-USDC on zkSync. 



There are two key reasons:
- To ensure a smooth transition for liquidity providers from farms managed by the Kitchen to farms which are managed by veCAKE voting, without affecting their APRs significantly in the initial rollout
- To ensure that core liquidity pools continue to receive sufficient incentives, so that liquidity depth and fee generation are not significantly affected. This will ensure the continuity of CAKE burns from trading fees, which drives deflationary CAKE tokenomics.

In the initial rollout phase, the Kitchen will distribute these votes based on the following principles:
- Ensuring core liquidity pools are provided a competitive return on their LP positions
- Ensuring that existing Syrup Pool partner arrangements are met before migrating them fully to the veCAKE gauge voting system
- Ensuring that any of the smaller farms which did not receive any votes after the launch of veCAKE will receive at least some allocation in the initial rollout, capped at their current emission levels.

With the proposed vote allocation, the Kitchen will distribute its share of votes at the end of each voting epoch after all voting participants have voted. 

In other words, the Kitchen will apply its voting share (at maximum, translating to ~0.4 CAKE/block) as far as needed to smoothen out any possible abrupt changes in the Farms, while allowing veCAKE participants to get used to the gauge voting mechanism. 

If the gauge voting results will not affect any core liquidity pools and trading volumes significantly, the Kitchen will abstain from voting in that particular voting epoch or vote in alignment with existing votes.

Over time, the Kitchen aims to reduce the portion of CAKE emissions directly managed by the Kitchen as all veCAKE participants become familiar with the process.

More information can be found in our [**docs**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/vecake/gauges-voting/faq). 

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE launched shortly on zkSync after this vote concludes.",bullish
277,"I sugest creating a multi-reward pool where everyone who had their Cake locked could earn token from other pools - a kind of Cake Vault. This would increase global apr, allow Cake holders to earn other tokens and encourage locking.

279,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

283,"According to the tokenomics (https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics), 27,513 CAKES are minted to the farm and 10,080 CAKES to the pool daily. 

This results to Farm: 10,042,245 CAKES minted ~2.59% inflation annually and to Pool: 3,679,200 CAKES minted ~0.95% inflation annually.

Note: Our closest competitor, Uniswap, has an annual emission rate of 2% for token staking for Governance and 0% for the farm. 

It is evident that the Pancakeswap team has made tremendous efforts to achieve Ultrasound cake and deserves congratulations. However, it no longer makes sense in the tokenomics (as it was important in the past) for the farm to earn more than those who believe in the token - holders in pools for Governance. Otherwise, we will not have long-term price support as Uniswap does. This is not fair to a team that build as much as Pancakeswap team nor to the community.

It is necessary to decrease emissions for the farm to accelerate Ultrasound CAKE. Remembering that the market value of CAKE is ~$447,090,114, and Uniswap is ~$3,720,731,550, it is not fair for Pancakeswap to have only 12% of the market value with a community and a team as strong as Pancakeswap's.

**Summary:**

>  This pool uses the  [ComposableStablePoolFactory-v3](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdba127fbc23fb20f5929c546af220a991b5c6e01#readContract) and will be composed of FRAX and bb-am-USD, AAVE v3 boost pool. The underlying tokens are USDC, DAI, USDT, and FRAX. These will each be wrapped through Aave's market to earn LPs additional yield, excluding FRAX. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. The gauge can be uncapped based on the contents being all large cap stable tokens.

**References/Useful links:**


> FRAX: Link to:

> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin) - Coingecko link

**Protocol Description:**

> Aave is a permissionless lending protocol built to help users lend and borrow digital assets. This provides yield bearing sources for various tokens, this case the stablecoins listed above. USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI corresponds to the Maker DAO and USDT is the Tether stablecoin. 

**Motivation:**

> Balancer’s heavy interest in taking over the yield bearing token space and increased capital efficiency through linear and boosted pool architecture continues to take effect. This provides better trading routes on the protocol and more sustainable pool options for liquidity providers to place their funds. The Aave v3 migration is well underway and the road has been, and still is being paved for many more boosted pool options for Balancer users.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** USDC are centralized and does not have a governance forum. FRAX governance process can be seen [here](https://docs.frax.finance/smart-contracts/governance) and their snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth).
2. **Oracles:** This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned.
3. **Audits:** FRAX See [here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits)
4. **Centralization vectors:** USDC is inherently centralized. FRAX governance process is highlighted above, and their stability mechanism is described [here](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/overview). Also their decentralization ratio is described [here](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/decentralization-ratio-dr).
5. **Market History:** See USDC [here ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/%5D(https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin)). and FRAX [here ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/frax).
6. **Value:** LPs & Balancer will earn the protocol fee on underlying bb-am-USD as well as swap fees. BIP-19 will incentivize TVL to continue to grow here with trading volume and this implementation will continue to draw in new volume, as well as showcase the power of these pool types.

With blCVX not being counted as non-native balance, Sett depositors would still be able to utilize their Boost power on other non-native Setts, while getting the Badger & bcvxCRV bonus from being in blCVX.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a Syrup Pool with Froyo Games, a decentralized game publisher offering a complete platform for blockchain games.

Froyo Games returns to the Syrup Pool with more rewards — this time with a FROYO-CAKE farm! 


#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $FROYO tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 5,883,000 FROYO
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on March 24th 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on May 23rd 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 3.404 FROYO 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the $FROYO Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a FROYO-CAKE farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the farm period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.

#### What is $FROYO?

From the team: “FROYO is the native token of the Froyo Games platform and the primary medium of transaction across all of its offerings, including but not limited to the Froyo NFT Marketplace and inside of the various Play-to-Earn games coming to the platform. Its supply is limited to 1,000,000,000 FROYO with no contract function to mint or burn any additional tokens. 

FROYO will also be used to purchase tickets on the Froyo Gamebox to enter into competitive mini-games with real prizes. In the future, $FROYO tokens can also be staked via the $veFROYO mechanism to earn more $FROYO tokens collected from fees and revenue of platform services, tokens from upcoming game releases and NFT airdrops for new games coming to the platform.”

Tessera offers a unique opportunity for Balancer to become a liquidity source and tap into the yield provided on the APE asset as well. By paring with wstETH we also encourage more wstETH trading activity and since wstETH/ETH is one of our largest pools, any increase in trading activity will make wstETH liquidity even more profitable for us.

This is a proposal to allocate some small portion of the Balancer ecosystem grant fund toward public goods.

We developers and community members of the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement recognize that, more often than not, we stand on the shoulders of giants. Decentralized Finance (DeFi), as well as the wider Ethereum and cryptoasset ecosystem, is a group effort and we can all do our part to make this technological revolution a reality. As a core building block within DeFi, the Balancer protocol directly benefits from any and all growth within the DeFi economy. As such, it would behoove us all to give back to the community that has enabled Balancer’s unparalleled growth over the last several months. Let’s help plant the seeds for some of next big Ethereum projects.

[Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/?) Round 7 began three days ago on September 15 and will run until October 2. Let’s get this proposal passed this weekend so that the Balancer community can become a matching partner for this round!

The following are the proposed options for a lump sum public goods contribution to Gitcoin Grants Round 7. The BAL tokens to be donated will be taken from the Balancer ecosystem grant fund.

Proposal to add gauge support for a newly created wstETH/ACX pool on Ethereum.

The Across team and community have decided to coordinate around using Balancer as the primary liquidity hub, want to establish strong initial liquidity, and keep the Balancer pool as the core liquidity–as well as encourage communities to be long term LPs. In addition to the Across treasury providing some native ACX rewards to LPs, we are optimisticly establishing this gauge and enabling Balancer and Aura emissions will help this become a strong sustainable liquidity solution for the protocol and community.

## Protocol Description:

Across is an optimistic insured bridge that relies on a decentralized group of relayers to fulfill user deposit requests from EVM to EVM networks. Relayer funds are insured by liquidity providers in a single pool on Ethereum and refunds are processed via the UMA Optimistic Oracle.

Designed by the engineers who built UMA, Across was the result of approaching bridging not only as a technical concern but as a financial engineering concern.

## Motivation:

Across’ goal is to become the most-used bridge in Web3. Previously we have listed BAL as a bridgeable asset on Across and this is another step in strengthening the relationship between the two protocols. In addition, this pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for Across and its ACX token. Overall, this will further the relationship between protocols and create a great liquidity solution for Across.

Specifications:

1. Governance: The Across governance model can be found here: https://docs.across.to/governance/governance-model. The current multi-sig setup will be replaced with an optimistic governance tool that was created by UMA and Snapshot in the next few months, provided that it is in production as planned.

2. Oracles: Across is secured by UMA’s optimistic oracle. More information can be found here: https://docs.umaproject.org/protocol-overview/how-does-umas-oracle-work#optimistic-oracle

3. Audits: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/uma-across-v2-audit/

4. Centralization vectors: Across’s rebalancing is done by a bot that is run by the foundation. Presently the bot is not profitable to run, so we would not expect anyone else to run it. However, there is no chance of money being inaccessible as a result of the bot stopping–Just that the bridge would run less efficiently.

Otherwise, no other centralization vectors listed apply to Across.
5. Market History: ACX has recently launched and doesn't have much market history at this time. Gauge address is 0x89F65570Ac019f86E145c501023e2ef7010D155B. Pool address is 0x798b112420AD6391A4129Ac25eF59663a44C88bB.

6. Value: This pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for Across and the ACX token. In addition, Across sees value in alignment with others in the ecosystem and sees potential and value in doing so with Balancer",bullish
296,"**CAKE holders**, today we are thrilled to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from TRON, a public blockchain dedicated to providing the underlying infrastructure that enables developers to create smart contracts and decentralized applications, freely publish, own, and store data & other content.

# What is Boost?
Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, TRX-BNB will go from a 1x multiple to a 2x multiple, which will last for 1 week, which will only cause temporary dilution among the other farms, and at the same time, there will be a new TRX Syrup Pool with $1M of tokens, to be earned by staking CAKE.



# The Syrup Pool:
Stake CAKE tokens to earn TRX tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 16,700,000 TRX
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start block:** 9202800 (approx. 9am UTC on July 16th)
- **Finish block:** 10930800 (approx. 9am UTC on September 14th)
- **Token rewards per block:** 9.6643 TRX


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.

# What is TRON?

TRON is committed to promoting the decentralization of the Internet and is dedicated to building the infrastructure for a decentralized Internet.The TRON Protocol, one of the largest blockchain-based decentralized operating systems in the world, offers scalable, high-availability, and high-throughput support that serves as the foundation for all decentralized applications in the TRON ecosystem.The Protocol also uses an innovative, pluggable smart contract platform to improve compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts.



### To learn more about TRON, the chefs advise you to visit their official communication channels:

# How do you stake CAKE to earn TRX rewards?
If you own CAKE tokens, congratulations! You’re the master of your … pancakes.
Time to step up your taste buds by learning how to stake CAKE with Syrup Pool.
- Visit this webpage: [**https://pancakeswap.finance/syrup** ](https://pancakeswap.finance/syrup )
- Click “Approve CAKE” on the TRX Syrup Pool 
- Click on the stake button.
- Confirm the transaction.

BEP20 TRX will also be circulating and transferable on BSC when we start the Syrup pool, so you will be able to harvest your TRX tokens and trade on PancakeSwap at any time!



# BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING! ⚠️⚠️⚠️💀

The official TRX token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:

Any other TRX token will be a scam and will result in a financial loss for users. Do not buy tokens from any other token address. Always verify the token address before purchasing tokens. If you receive airdrops from another address for TRX tokens, they will be rotten tokens (but not the cool kind!), and we advise you to ignore them.",bearish

### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard CDCETH to Aave V3 on Ethereum
### Author: Jlok & ACI
###  Date: 2024-07-15

---
### Summary:

This proposal is to explore community interest in adding [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH CDCETH) to Aave V3 on the Ethereum mainnet. CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.

### Motivation

[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet. As of June 2024, [Crypto.com (http://crypto.com/) has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.

[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform. 

To enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) introduced a Liquid Staking Token (LST) - [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).

Currently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues. 

Other liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers. 

The liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.

Integrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded.

Confidential banners/listings on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.
Onboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH & Aave adoption & increased revenues for both parties.

### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments

 [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.

Integration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.

### Specification

Contract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e
Rate Provider contract for current exchange rate:
0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)

title: Add TerraUSD to Aave V2
status: ARC posted, pending snapshot vote
author: @larry0x
shortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for UST
ARC discussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-support-for-terra-usd-ust/6003
created: 2021-11-09
updated: N/A
---

## Simple Summary

TerraUSD (UST) is an algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin issued on the Terra blockchain. Its market capitalization has grown to [almost $2.8B](​https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-usd​) since its inception on October 1. UST is designed such that each UST can be redeemed for $1 of LUNA, and vice versa. This has kept the price close to the peg, which is essential for a stablecoin.

## Motivation

Terra is committed to a multi-chain strategy and as such are motivated to find vibrant borrowing/lending markets for UST on all of the chains where UST is supported. Ethereum continues to be the top destination for assets from the Terra ecosystem.

UST is supported by major dApps including Curve, Uniswap, Sushi, Harvest, etc. UST can also be deposited into Mirror Protocol mAsset pools on Uniswap, and is depositable into Anchor via [EthAnchor](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/developers-ethereum/ethanchor). We believe there will be sufficient demand for borrowing/lending given the variety of existing use cases.

Finally, as referenced earlier, Terra has begun its migration from its centrally held bridge to [Wormhole](https://twitter.com/wormholecrypto). This move should lower the centralization risks associated with UST while increasing its adoption case as it reaches more chains via Wormhole in the future.

## Proposed Parameters

UST will be used both as collateral and for borrowing. We proposed the same parameters used for DAI:

```typescript
export const strategyUST: IReserveParams = {
  optimalUtilizationRate: new BigNumber(0.8).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  baseVariableBorrowRate: new BigNumber(0).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  variableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.04).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  variableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(0.75).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  stableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.02).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  stableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(0.75).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  baseLTVAsCollateral: '7500',
  liquidationThreshold: '8000',
  liquidationBonus: '10500',
  borrowingEnabled: true,
  stableBorrowRateEnabled: true,
  reserveDecimals: '18',

**Protocol Description:**

[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer

Renzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.

With +4,500 total unique depositors, +33,000 restaked ETH, and an average of ~6 ETH per deposit, Renzo is the fastest growing restaking protocol on EigenLayer

Renzo introduces the Balancer Boosted Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/WETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.

**Motivation:**

Renzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/WETH 50/50 pool] on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.

**Specifications:**
 
**Governance:**
Renzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.

**Oracles:**
Renzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.

**Audits:**
Renzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pd)

**Centralization vectors:**
Centralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting,

Overtime, our goal is to migrate Renzo to utilize decentralized infrastructure.

**Market History:**
From 0 to 100, Renzo launched on EigenLayer Mainnet 1-month ago and has witnessed explosive growth. TVL is nearing +$90M USD, with +33k ETH restaked, and over +4,500 unique depositors.

Renzo’s remarkable growth and strong community backing underscore its prominence servicing users with liquid restaking on EigenLayer. The ezETH/WETH pool on Balancer will mark its inaugural support on a DEX.
 
 
![veBAL gauge.png](ipfs://bafkreihp6ndnucaokydajbmb5dma6skebx4wffdbcmfotxyrjzrxpf5zaa)
    

**Value:**

Renzo recently closed a successful seed round in December 2023, raising $3.2 million in equity with a 1:1 Token Warrant. The post-round valuation stands at an impressive $25 million, showcasing strong support for Renzo’s innovative liquid restaking protocol.

Renzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2’s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects. 

Above all, Renzo is committed to building the most successful liquid restaking ecosystem on EigenLayer, delivering rewarding experiences for all restakers and holders of ezETH.

This proposal presents the idea that the Forever Apes team produce 1000 ApeCoin Capsules. Contents include 4 stickers, 1 patch, and 1 poster.
FREE to claim (plus shipping) to anyone with 20 $APE in their wallet. We believe this encourages token accumulation, furthers $APE brand recognition IRL, and reduces unauthorized sales via unofficial channels. We are requesting roughly 3800 $APE and use of the ApeCoin logo to do this.

- 250 Capsules will be reserved for giveaways to encourage DAO participation.
- 1 Capsule per wallet / physical address.

309,"#### Upgrade of Galxe’s Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift Galxe’s Farm rewards from the current GAL-BNB v2 LP to the new GAL-BNB v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the GAL-BNB v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the GAL token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current GAL price.)

To ensure a smooth transition between v2 and v3 pairs, there will be an overlap of one day where there will be incentives directed towards both farms. This will occur on 5 May 2023. 

After **0900 UTC on 5 May 2023**, only the v3 pair will receive incentives, so users are encouraged to migrate in advance of this time.

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new Farm will have doubled emissions for the first 7 days. For example, if the v2 farm emits 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will emit 20 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 10 CAKE per day thereafter.

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake GAL-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.5x multiplier
- **24 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.25% fee tier):
- Stake GAL-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 1.2x multiplier (2.4x multiplier for the first 7 days)
- 48 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and **24 CAKE per day** thereafter 

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 1.2x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### Key timelines

* **Launch of GAL-BNB v3 farm:** Approx. 0900 UTC on 5 May 2023
* **Sunset of GAL-BNB v2 farm:** Approx. 0900 UTC on 6 May 2023

#### How to migrate?

Please remember to shift your LP to the new farm before the v2 farm sunsets.

Please refer to the following [**link**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/code/v3-migration/how-to-migrate) for migration instructions

#### What is Galxe?

Galxe helps developers and organizations leverage NFTs and digital credential data to build better products and communities in Web3.

#### What is $GAL?
From the team: “Galxe aims to build a permissionless, open, and collaborative credential data network. The GAL token is an essential component of such infrastructures as it functions as the governance token, incentivizes user participation, and serves as the primary payment token of the Galxe ecosystem.

The use cases of GAL are as follows:

- Governance: GAL token holders can vote on Project Galaxy DAO’s governance proposals
- Paying for Fees: Developers who aim to utilize Galaxy’s credential data will be charged in GAL
- Curating Credentials: Curators are incentivized to stake GAL tokens to signal a credential data sets value. Each credential data set will include a revenue stream that will be split between credential stakeholders pro-rata”

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Further Aave v1 deprecation strategy

Author: BGD Labs @bgdlabs

Date: 2024-01-09

---

## Summary
Approve further steps of Aave v1 off-boarding, to reduce operational overhead on deprecated Aave instances.


## Motivation
The Aave protocol v1 was released in January 2020 and eventually superseded by Aave protocol v2 in December on the same year.

While Aave v1 has been deprecated for a long time, some liquidity is still stuck on the protocol 1. Even if this instance is not covered by the Aave Safety Module, being part of Aave, it still is monitored and evaluated whenever development and/or security decisions are made.

This creates meaningful overhead for all involved development & security teams, which directly adds cost to the Aave DAO. Additionally, the architecture of Aave v1 is quite different to Aave v2 & v3, making it the most ad-hoc instance of Aave.

For the previous reasons, we think the community should evaluate approving extra off-boarding steps.


## Specification
To achieve a complete off-boarding of Aave v1, the following needs to be completed:

- All debt has to be settled, in order to allow liquidity providers on v1 to withdraw.
- All assets have to be withdrawn.

To minimise the impact on users we propose a phased approach, where each phase could last in the order of 1-3 weeks.

### Phase 1
In a first phase we recommend to upgrade the liquidation mechanism on the protocol in the following ways:

- It should no longer be possible to receive aTokens for liquidations (as the goal is to remove liquidity, not transfer it from user to user).
- It should be possible to liquidate healthy (collateralised) positions with a fixed liquidationBonus (e.g. 1%). This value should be small to not hurt borrowers, while still being big enough to incentivise liquidations. If this Temp Check is successful, we will confirm the number with risk providers., but 1% at the current moment would make the liquidation profitable for approximately 85% of the positions to liquidate.
- It should be possible to liquidate a entire position at once (currently on Aave v1 only 50% of a position can be liquidated).
- Interest rates should be lowered to the minimum, as the previously described always-enabled dynamics remove any need of utilisation dynamics.
- Remove flash loan fee, as there should not be extra incentives for liquidity providers.

### Phase 2
In a second phase we recommend increasing the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage.

The exact number must be chosen based on current market conditions to minimise user impact, but allow economical liquidations.

### Phase 3
Once the big majority of debt is repaid, we recommend to introduce a forced withdrawal mechanism. With forced withdrawals anybody could withdraw on behalf of any liquidity provider on Aave v1, with the funds received by the holder of the aToken.

It is important to clarify that further technical aspects on this should be analysed before executing this step, for example smart contracts receiving funds without triggering a withdrawal.

---

After all the Phases are finished, additional ad-hoc steps can be executed, like Rescue Mission for locked funds.


## Next Steps

If this TEMP CHECK is approved, we will proceed with an ARFC, with the final steps including feedback from risk service providers, and precise technical decisions.

Finally, AIPs will be created for the different phases.

317,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-authorize-gauntlet-for-oracle-pools/1888).

Three weeks ago, Balancer governors [voted to allow Gauntlet](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer/proposal/QmZZycpDWZYAzNho6uVaWL5nFpVzauc89HC9d5QNTSn18J) to set swap fees on pools deployed from the [WeightedPoolFactory](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8E9aa87E45e92bad84D5F8DD1bff34Fb92637dE9#code). At the time, this was the only Balancer V2 pool factory available; but since then, another specialization has been deployed for [two-token pools which provide TWAP oracles](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA5bf2ddF098bb0Ef6d120C98217dD6B141c74EE0#code). This proposal seeks to grant the same authorization to Gauntlet, but for the new pool factory.

## Motivation

Please consult the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-v2-authorize-gauntlet-network-to-set-swap-fees/1799) for the full details. In short, this authorization would apply **only to pools using the delegated owner** address (`0xBA1BA1ba1BA1bA1bA1Ba1BA1ba1BA1bA1ba1ba1B`). For those pools which have opted in, Gauntlet's power would extend **only to the swap fee**; Gauntlet cannot alter any other attributes of the pool nor extract funds.

Title: [ARFC] TokenLogic & karpatkey Service Provider Partnership
Discussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633
Author: @TokenLogic @karpatkey
Created: 2023-12-05

---

# Summary

This ARFC is to onboard TokenLogic & karpatkey to provide financial services to the Aave DAO for an initial period of 180 days, with a combined budget of 400k GHO.

# Motivation

## Overview

TokenLogic & karpatkey are responsible for delivering the following services to the Aave DAO: 

* Treasury Management;
* Strategic Assets' Liquidity; and
* Safety Module.

This funding will be used to support the TokenLogic and karpatkey teams to deliver the scope as outlined in the [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633).

## What to Expect

This proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO’s treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.

### Treasury Management

#### Develop the Architecture for Managing Aave's Assets

We aim to define a robust architecture for asset management. This architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s “shortExecutor”. Over time this will lead to fund management delegation and reduced governance overhead.

As the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.

#### Financial Security

A key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO’s known budget and anticipated expenses. 

This approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO. Key components of this objective will include:

* Bridging Aave funds between networks;
* Migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and
* Swap assets to align expenses and holdings.

Do note, that financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost-conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.

### Strategic Assets' Liquidity

TokenLogic and karpatkey will lead the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) and oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:

* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO’s price movement towards re-pegging while maintaining its utility across a full range of AMMs.
    * Utilize Maverick’s design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.
    * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.
    * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.
    * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility in their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave’s AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.
* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token’s value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:
    * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.
    * Enhance GHO’s extrinsic demand by incentivizing stable swap pools, such as Balancer’s GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.
     * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer’s architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO’s price stability.
     * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.
    * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.
* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it into tangible rewards through participation in voting markets such as Curve, Convex, Balancer, and Aura.

For operational simplicity and alignment with the DAO’s strategic objectives, evolving the GHO Liquidity Committee into the Aave Liquidity Committee is a logical step. 

### Safety Module

As part of the scope, karpatkey and TokenLogic will focus on modelling the SM performance during shortfall events and present proposals to diversify asset categories. This proposal will feature how the DAO can utilize the vlAURA position, realize synergies between GHO Liquidity and overall attempt to reduce the DAOs insurance fund spend.

The below outlines at a high level what we intend to deliver:

* Introduce additional asset categories to promote diversification and reduce the dependence on AAVE as a backstop for the protocol. 
    * Initial parameter configuration will incorporate feedback from @ChaosLabs & @Gauntlet. 
    * We will explore the feasibility of including GHO LP assets and harness rewards from other protocols.
    * Technical lift associated with creating new categories will be performed by @bgdlabs, with a security audit, if required.
* A 90-day emission forecast will be provided ahead of each emission cycle for community feedback. TokenLogic and karpatkey will prepare the payload to extend the SM emissions for @bgdlabs for review. 
    * Iterative emission cycles enable the DAO to target specific asset categories and improve the correlations between bad debt potential whilst maintaining a base level of insurance. The proposal will feature the ability to reward some categories with non AAVE rewards, like GHO, to support adoption and velocity.
* Capital efficiency, optimize emission schedules to balance attracting and retaining new deposits for each respective category. For example, the APR on stkAAVE is expected to continue being reduced given the recent GHO Mint Discount utility being added and the introduction of new categories.
* Analytics, a dashboard will be created/maintained that tracks the effective coverage of the insurance fund under various market conditions. The deposit value, composition of assets, APR over time and impact on the DAOs runway will all be readily available for the community to view. This is expected to create transparency and provide insight into the performance of the SM as an effective insurance fund for the DAO.

# Specification

The AIP will call the createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController interface to create two 180-day streams for 220k and 180k of GHO.

The following address will be the recipient of the 220k GHO stream:
Address: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`

The following address will be the recipient of the 180k GHO stream:
Address: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`

TokenLogic and karpatkey will periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.

TokenLogic and karpatkey are to be included in the Gas Rebate program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts, deployment and testing costs.

Upon the ARFC Snapshot passing, the GLC SAFE Signers will be updated. The following signer `0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f` is to be replaced with `0x818c277dbe886b934e60aa047250a73529e26a99`.

When the AIP onboarding TokenLogic and karpatkey as service providers pass, TokenLogic and karpatkey will jointly lead the GLC for the duration of the service provider contract with the Aave DAO.

Title: [ARFC] Aave DAO Policy Change: Halt Listings on all Aave v1 & v2 Non Permissioned Deployments
Author: @Llamaxyz, Gauntlet, Chaos Labs, 3SE Holdings & @ItsFreeRealEstate
Status: Proposed
Dated: 2022.11.25

---

# Simple Summary

As part of the *Sunsetting of v1*, the *v2 -> v3 Migration* & the *Deprecation of v2* discussions being conducted by the community [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-discussion-v2-v3-migration-v2-deprecation/10676) and [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategy-on-sunsetting-of-aave-v1/9450), the authors are appealing to the Aave DAO to adopt a policy of halting listings on the following markets:

- Aave v1 \(Ethereum & Uniswap Markets\)
- Aave v2 \(Ethereum, AMM, Polygon & Avalanche Markets\)



# Abstract

With the release of Aave v3 featuring superior risk management parameters and controls, this proposal advocates only enabling future asset listings to occur on Aave v3 deployments. Upon implementation of this upgrade, via a successful Snapshot vote, assets can no longer be add/introduced to the Aave v2 deployments.  

**Note: The Aave Arc & Centrifuge RWA markets, which are powered by the ""Permissioned"" V2 codebase are not included. These liquidity pools support the latest battletested version of the ""Permissioned"" code base.**


# Motivation

This proposal seeks to begin the transition from v2 to v3 deployments. The first step in this progression is to focus our efforts on growing the v3 deployments whilst continuing to actively support the v2 deployments in all other areas. Going forward all future asset listings are to be limited to only v3 deployments.

Successful passing of this ARFC will indicate the DAO has decided that the various V3 deployments are the future of the Aave DAO, and support of the various listed markets will be limited to Risk and Critical Technical Updates.

Authors: StaFi Contributors, with support from Aura contributors

**Summary**

StaFi proposes the creation of a Balancer gauge for a rETH-ETH pool on mainnet, with a 10% emissions cap.

**Protocol Description**

StaFi is a liquid staked derivatives protocol launched in Q3 2020, with a focus on bringing liquidity to staked assets on Ethereum and other Proof of Stake chains such as Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot. Since launch, the protocol has accrued over $36,000,000 worth of staked assets across 11 tokens, with 3,439 active validators.

Similar to other LSD protocols, StaFi issues a liquid receipt token (rETH) representing your share of ether staked on the Beacon Chain via a permissionless validator set. Deposits are partially covered by validator deposits. The exchange rate between rETH/ETH will gradually increase as staking rewards accumulate, though rETH is not redeemable for the ether principal and rewards until after the Shanghai upgrade.

StaFi has a native governance token with the ticker “FIS”. FIS is freely tradable on a number of centralized exchanges, alongside some decentralized exchanges not inclusive of Balancer. FIS has governance utility and can be staked by validators in the StaFi consensus network.

**Motivation**

StaFi currently has an[ existing rETH-ETH pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/reth/deposit) on Curve that sees regular trades between both assets.

StaFi is looking to expand the availability and liquidity of its staked derivatives, starting with rETH, through Balancer. Ahead of and after the Shanghai Ethereum hard fork, liquidity and yield on LSDs will be a key competing factor as LSD protocols seek integrations and a broader base of holders.

StaFi is committed to driving value to the veBAL ecosystem by incentivizing pool liquidity via Hidden Hand voting incentives. Deeper liquidity should lead to increased volume and revenue accrual.

**Specifications**

1. Governance: [DAO forum](https://commonwealth.im/stafi)
2. Oracles: Direct Balance Query: The rETH rateProvider has a getRate() function that calls rETH's own getExchangeRate() function. See the [contract here](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/rtoken-contracts/blob/main/contracts/balancer-metastable-rate-providers/RETHRateProvider.sol)
3. Audits: [StaFi rToken App Audits](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/stafi-bootstrap/tree/master/audits)
4. Centralization Vectors:StaFi’s rebalancing is done by a bot that is run by the foundation. Presently the bot is not profitable to run, so we would not expect anyone else to run it. However, there is no chance of money being inaccessible as a result of the bot stopping–Just that the bridge would run less efficiently.
5. Market History: rETH has been a tradable asset since March 2021. Trading has primarily taken place in the aforementioned rETH-ETH pool on Curve. FIS is a liquid asset traded both on top centralized exchanges as well as decentralized exchanges.
6. Value: StaFi will make its Balancer rETH-ETH pool a primary source of liquidity for rETH on Ethereum mainnet. By bolstering liquidity of the pool, Balancer should gain from increased trading fees.

329,"#### Upgrade of Stader BNBx’s Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift Stader BNBx’s Farm rewards from the current BNBX-BNB v2 LP to the new BNBX-BNB v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the BNBX-BNB v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the BNBX token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current BNBX price.)

To ensure a smooth transition between v2 and v3 pairs, there will be an overlap of one day where there will be incentives directed towards both farms. This will occur on 4 May 2023. 

After **0800 UTC on 4 May 2023**, only the v3 pair will receive incentives, so users are encouraged to migrate in advance of this time.

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new v3 Farm will have the same emissions as the v2 farm. For example, if the v2 farm emits 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will also emit 10 CAKE per day.

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake BNBX-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 1.9x multiplier
- **89 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.05% fee tier):
- Stake BNBX-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 4.6x multiplier 
- **89 CAKE per day**

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 4.6x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### Key timelines

* **Launch of BNBX-BNB v3 farm:** Approx. 0800 UTC on 4 May 2023
* **Sunset of BNBX-BNB v2 farm:** Approx. 0800 UTC on 5 May 2023

#### How to migrate?

Please remember to shift your LP to the new farm before the v2 farm sunsets.

Please refer to the following [**link**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/code/v3-migration/how-to-migrate) for migration instructions

#### What is Stader BNBx?

Stader Labs offers a convenient way for users to stake their assets. It offers liquid staking solutions across multiple chains - BNB Chain, Polygon, Hedera, NEAR, Fantom, etc.

With Stader’s BNB liquid staking solution, users can stake BNB and earn yields with capital efficiency. Users can also amplify their yields by deploying BNBx (liquid token for staked BNB) in DeFi.

#### What is $BNBX?
From the team: “BNBx is a reward-bearing liquid token. The value of 1 BNBx token vs. BNB increases over time as staking rewards accumulate.”

#### **⚠️⚠️⚠️BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING⚠️⚠️⚠️**

The official BNBX token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:

**https://bscscan.com/token/0x1bdd3cf7f79cfb8edbb955f20ad99211551ba275**

​Any other BNBX token will be a scam. Always verify the token address before buying tokens. If you receive a BNBX token airdrop from another address, it’s probably a scam, and we advise you to ignore it.",bearish
330,"[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum.](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-liquidity-staking/243). The proposed code to implement it can be found [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/tree/liquidity-staking).

# TLDR:

Proposal to have 45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity between BAL and uncapped tokens (WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC). Wallets flagged as Balancer Labs shareholders don't qualify for this ""liquidity staking"" extra incentive.
The main goals are to significantly increase liquidity on key BAL pairs and to allow non-shareholders to compound their BAL holdings at a much faster pace, accelerating protocol decentralization.

![image|621x500, 50%](upload://5S3GvpjON1hNGnO7wuSfqNd3smk.png)   


# Motivation

The **importance of BAL liquidity** can't be overstated:

* *TRUER PRICE DISCOVERY*: it improves trading conditions for all market participants (lower spreads and less slippage for both buyers and sellers), allowing for a more transparent and effective price discovery process;

* *SUPERIOR LP INCENTIVES*: a stronger token (with higher price inertia) results in a higher quality for the incentives given to LPs (liquidity providers) via liquidity mining;

* *SHARPER GOVERNANCE*: it opens doors to a new class of invaluable stakeholders and protocol governors (e.g. larger investors, especially those heavily involved in and experienced with DeFi protocols);

* *BROADER GOVERNANCE*: with no participation from Balancer Labs' shareholders (more on that later), liquidity staking will accelerate BAL distribution and protocol decentralization by giving all other BAL holders the opportunity to compound their governance rights at a much faster pace;

* *SAFER GOVERNANCE*: pools are non-custodial and BAL in them retain full voting power (i.e. no need to withdraw liquidity to vote), such that high liquidity and a healthy governance are not in conflict;

Balancer itself being a DEX, it feels only natural as the ideal venue for high BAL liquidity to be incentivized. Finally, it's worth noting that allowing a high portion of the token supply to be concentrated on *centralized* exchanges could expose the governance to significant risks, as illustrated by the episode with STEEM.


# Recapping: how liquidity adjustment currently works

The 145k BAL [weekly distribution](https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/bal-liquidity-mining) to LPs on Balancer is calculated proportionally to the *adjusted* liquidity contributed by each LP. This adjustment is made by applying (i.e. multiplying) a few *factors* to their liquidity measured in dollar terms.

Naturally, the value of those factors can be:
* equal to `1`, having no effect;
* less than `1`, acting as a penalty (when the liquidity is deemed less useful);
* greater than `1`, acting as an extra incentive.

A `feeFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-feefactor-toward-reducing-the-mining-penalty-for-high-fee-pools/103)) applies a small penalty to pools with higher fees.

**For each pair inside a pool**, we apply:
*  a `wrapFactor` of:
   * `1.0` for uncorrelated pairs (no penalty),
   * `0.2` for [soft pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-wrapfactor-applying-a-0-2-factor-to-soft-pegged-pairs/138),
   * `0.1` for [hard pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/wrapfactor-penalizing-pairs-of-equivalent-tokens-in-liquidity-mining/28); and 

* a `BRF` (BAL & Ratio Factor), which is the combination of a `ratioFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/introduction-of-a-weight-ratio-factor-in-liquidity-mining/15)) and a `stakingBoost ≥ 1` (described in [this proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102) and with further calculation details specified in its [ammendment](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102/4)). 
`BRF = stakingBoost * ratioFactor`
  * If the pair is **not** of type `{BAL & uncapped_token}` (uncapped tokens currently being: WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC, BAL), then its `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. the incentive doesn't apply to this pair).

The current `BRF` will only depend on the characteristics of the pool (its tokens and weights), and may have a maximum value of `1.54`. It looks like this:

![image|690x455, 75%](upload://xqztRzplangZYzS0j70jlwfgc7P.png) 

After looping through all possible pairs in a pool, we combine their factors (via [weighted average](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/master/lib/factors.js#L111)) and the result is a `wrapFactor` and a `BRF` for the whole pool. 

Finally, we calculate and apply a `tokenCapFactor` adjusting down the liquidity of a token when it exceeds a predetermined maximum. Except for the 5 uncapped tokens already mentioned, all tokens eligible for liquidity mining are currently capped at $10M each. See more details on [how to calculate it](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56) and the [recent changes](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217) to how token caps will evolve.

# The Proposal

This is a proposal to have **45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity staking**.

This extra incentive is:

> all BAL distributed as a result of applying a `stakingBoost > 1` to the liquidity of `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs, from wallets which are not flagged as shareholders of Balancer Labs.

The remaining **100k BAL would be distributed to all LPs** in all eligible pools, disconsidering the effect of a `stakingBoost` (i.e. all liquidity being subject to `BRF = ratioFactor`).

The constant value now would be: `STAKERS_SHARE = 45000 / 145000`, and we can then calculate the unique value for `stakingBoost` that satisfies this target distribution. 

The intended result is for BAL liquidity on Balancer to increase substantially, **but in a self-regulated way**. 

The simple yet powerful idea is: as BAL liquidity gets higher the extra incentive to staking gets **diluted among stakers**, so that our constant target for `STAKERS_SHARE` is met.

In a more visual approach:
 
* when non-shareholder BAL liquidity is low, the `stakingBoost` will be high, resulting in a high `BRF` (a hypothetical scenario being the **orange** curve in the graph below, in which `BRF` peaks at `12`), so there will be a *very strong* incentive for BAL liquidity to increase;

* when non-shareholer BAL liquidity is high (the desired scenario), the `stakingBoost` will have come down to lower levels, resulting in a lower BRF (a hypothetical scenario being the **green** curve below, in which `BRF` peaks at `3`).

![image|621x500](upload://oI5XnPgsZE1VcQWDyeJCWovr1IV.png)  

# Calculating the stakingBoost: a practical example

We first calculate the `liquidityPreStaking`: the total adjusted liquidity from applying all factors, but with `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. `BRF = ratioFactor`). Let's say the result was $200M.

We will need to apply a yet unknown stakingBoost so that:
```STAKERS_SHARE = (finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / finalLiquidity```

... which can also be stated as:
```finalLiquidity = liquidityPreStaking / (1 - STAKERS_SHARE)```

In our example:
```finalLiquidity = $200M / (1 - 45000/145000) = $290M```

We may apply any temporary `tempStakingBoost > 1` to `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs from non-shareholder LPs, resulting in a `tempLiquidity`. Let's say our result was $230M. This would mean the `tempStakingBoost` increased the adjusted liquidity in $30M, while what we actually want is an increase of $90M.

Now to get the desired `stakingBoost`, we only need to ""stretch"" or ""shrink"" the `tempStakingBoost` according to the ratio between the two liquidity adjustments (desired & temporary):

```
(finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / (tempLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
```
... which in our example would result in:
```
(290 - 200) / (230 - 200) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost
stakingBoost = 3 * tempStakingBoost
```

# Shareholder Addresses

An important aspect of this proposal is that Balancer Labs shareholders (investors, advisors and founders) seem aligned with the spirit of the proposal: to accelerate governance rights distribution. In order to achieve this goal, their wallets will be excluded from participating in liquidity staking. This restriction doesn't apply to eventual BAL they hold that are unrelated to their shareholder allocations, for instance BAL bought on the market or earned through being LPs with tokens other than their BAL shareholder allocation.

[Here is the complete list of shareholder addresses to be excluded from liquidity staking](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/liquidity-staking/src/users.ts).

Note: wallets currently tagged as ""Balancer: Shareholder XX"" on Etherscan are actually *vesting smart contracts* which hold mostly locked (i.e. yet unvested) BAL. Vesting happens continuously and linearly over a period of 3 years which started at token launch (2020-06-20). When finally vested (i.e. free to transfer), BAL can only be withdrawn to the respective beneficiary address of each vesting contract. The addresses listed above are the 51 unique beneficiaries of the 51 vesting contracts. All the BAL balance they already hold is vested.

The community is willing to tolerate up to about 10k BAL per week per shareholder being sent to centralized exchanges as they are cognizant of shareholders also seeking to deleverage their BAL positions over time, without attempting to subvert the exclusion list. In case some large BAL balances move to third-party custody solutions held in segregated addresses or to multisig wallets (both situations are likely to happen), the current list may be updated to reflect those new shareholder addresses as also excluded from liquidity staking.

The community will have the prerogative to update this list so that changes are effective already before any still pending weekly distribution.",bullish
331,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas-replenish-budget-w-50-000-bal/1695).

The BAL for Gas budget is nearly exhausted and needs to be replenished in order for the program to continue beyond this week.

# The Proposal
Add **50,000 BAL** from the Ecosystem Fund to the BAL for Gas budget. For reference on the mechanics of the ongoing campaign, please consult the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas/1437) which was approved by governance five weeks ago. In summary, the campaign's budget is used to distribute BAL tokens to traders on the [Balancer Exchange](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap) as a subsidy for Ethereum network gas costs. It is consumed on a first-come, first-served basis, and will most likely be depleted within the next few days unless this proposal is approved to replenish.

# Motivation
The Ethereum network has been quite congested for the last several months as the DeFi ecosystem continues to flourish. As an unfortunate result of this increased demand, transaction costs are often prohibitive for the average user. The Balancer community strives to cultivate a protocol that is welcoming to all - not only to whales - and so it has been utilizing its sizeable treasury to help reduce the overall costs of protocol usage.

The BAL for Gas campaign also serves as a mechanism for distributing Balancer protocol governance power to one of its widest user bases: traders. The [liquidity mining program](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/proposing-balancer-liquidity-mining-cab4503972fa) has been distributing BAL tokens to liquidity providers for almost a year (45 weeks!), but only with the recent launch of BAL for Gas did traders become eligible as well. In the time since the initial pilot, 43,019 BAL tokens have been distributed to 20,749 unique addresses. Of those recipients, 18,970 (91%) did not hold any BAL prior to the start of the program!

Though the campaign has already been live for several weeks, recent [traction on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1379501996353392645) and new advertisements in podcasts/newsletters suggest that visibility is only just beginning. These distribution numbers should continue to grow in the weeks ahead and provide a deeper window into the lasting effects (or lack thereof) of the program.",bullish

333,"Harmony is proposing to deploy Aave v2 on the Harmony blockchain to expand lending to a growing community of users and provide incentives to bootstrap the launch of Aave to a new ecosystem. 

Paragraph Summary

Our goal is to accelerate Aave's expansion in the multi-chain world. Harmony is an open and fast blockchain that is fully Ethereum compatible with 2-second transaction finality and near-zero fees. 

Harmony invites the Aave community to support this launch by participating in the Aave contracts deployment, enabling the Aave v2 front-end for Harmony markets, and adding Harmony in its recently announced cross-chain governance module roadmap.  

Harmony will start by providing $5M USD in ONE tokens in incentives to bootstrap initial usage of Aave on Harmony. 

We specifically planned for a one year incentive campaign so that net new users have the opportunity to come into Aave and decentralized finance. We know that many protocols are giving out even higher incentives over a short period of time. We chose an attractive incentive over a longer period so that new users who may not be experienced power users can also benefit from the launch. 

In addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support. 

Our overall goal is to use Harmony’s $300 million ecosystem fund for growing a deep base of 10,000 builders and 10 million users. 

Motivation

Aave is already planning to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Harmony ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Sushi on Harmony and other DeFi projects. Aave will be the first major lending protocol on Harmony and will add net new users from Harmony’s 350,000+ community members. After enabling basic DeFi primitives like AMMs, our community is eagerly awaiting lending markets on Harmony.

**TL:DR**

As outlined in the [new whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the MKR capFactor from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). MKR has exceeded $10m adjusted liquidity for a period of time. MKR bring good liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem.

**The Proposal**

This is a proposal to increase the MKR cap Tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). MKR currently has $16M in adjusted liquidity and has probably surpassed it's $10M cap for a month.

MKR brings useful liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem. Before, Uniswap used to be the most popular DEX for trading MKR.

---

**What is MKR?**

MKR is a DeFi large cap, it currently has a $600M market cap. There's currently $1.5B locked in MakerDAO, and 425M DAI has been minted.

SCD (Single Collateral DAI) was launched in December 2017. MCD (Multi Collateral DAI) was launched in November 2019.

MakerDAO is a decentralized credit platform on Ethereum that supports DAI, a stablecoin whose value is pegged to USD. Anyone can use Maker to open a Vault, lock in collateral such as ETH, BAT, or WBTC ... and generate Dai as debt against that collateral. Dai debt incurs a stability fee (i.e., continuously accruing interest), which is paid upon repayment of borrowed Dai. DAI is collected as system surplus, and then used in FLAP auctions to burn MKR.

MKR can also be used as a governance token to govern the system. MKR holders also act as the last line of defense in case of a black swan event. If system-wide collateral value falls too low too fast, MKR is minted and sold on the open market to raise more collateral, diluting MKR holders.

I know cake is an inflationary token and a maximum supply isn't really possible due to minting. 

However i believe if a maximum supply is set it would effect people psychologically making it more appealing. As for pancakeswap it would be like setting a deadline to have 0 emissions or below before we hit the max supply. 

Here is the plan:
Maximum supply will be set at 500m which would take over 2 years for it to hit. Pancakeswap will do everything within 2 years to bring emissions down to 0 or negative to prevent it hitting 500m.

If pancakeswap fails to achieve it then once we hit 500m cake all new minting will be paused and rewards will be given out from NFT fees, IFO, transaction fees etc....  Please note by then we may have even features that would burn cake like gamification, margin, lending and borrowing.",neutral

# Summary

> * **This is a proposal to enable a 10% capped Balancer gauge for a wstETH/WETH pool on Beethoven Optimism.** The pool is a custom pool from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture that will bring a new kind of concentrated liquidity to BeethovenX that is much more efficient and customizable compared to all other existing pool types. The pool is an E-CLP or Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool.
> 
> * **The wstETH/WETH pool is deployed on Optimism [here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x7ca75bdea9dede97f8b13c6641b768650cb83782#code), with this [root gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x730A168cF6F501cf302b803FFc57FF3040f378Bf) and this [Optimism gauge](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9f9f8d58496691d541c40dbc2b1b20f8c43e8d8c#readContract).** We ask for this pool to be designated as a 'Core pool'.

# Protocol description

> * stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. -[ Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)
> * wstETH is a wrapped version of regular stETH, while wETH is a wrapped version of Ethereum. 
> * The E-CLP uses an [internal conversion](https://github.com/gyrostable/vaults/blob/main/contracts/eclp/GyroECLPPool.sol#L723) to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.

*** 
# Motivation

> * **The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP) which enables trading along the curve of an ellipse.** This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens and it could generate significant trading volume. This pool will provide liquidity for the following pair: wstETH/wETH
> 
> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards BeethovenX. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.
> * **This pool will be launched in cooperation with BeethovenX.** With the core pool designation it would be possible to recycle protocol fees.
> * **We expect the E-CLP to be 1.67x as efficient as the comparable, live StableSwap pool with an amplification factor of 500.** The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:
>   * *Customizable liquidity profiles:* Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
>   * *Price bounds*: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.
> * **The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are illustrated by the recently deployed stMATIC/wMATIC E-CLP.** The below box plot shows stMATIC/wMATIC liquidity utilisation. The stacked area chart, shows how the E-CLP already reached up to 55% of the total market share of stMATIC on Polygon very quickly after inception, with only a fraction of the total TVL.

![bip-346-2.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiet5s73kd4sp24aoy7husortt7q3cu3jlbo2wmnggb6vddbweq7by)
    
    

> * **Notably, the currently deployed stMATIC E-CLP is more oriented towards swap fee revenue for LPs.** It features a higher swap fee than comparable pools. As such, stMATIC E-CLP volume is subject to some fluctuations, and it is often the dominant pool on high volume days (as aligns with the stacked area chart).
>
> * **The wstETH E-CLP on Optimism, however, has a lower swap fee of 1bp and is more oriented towards becoming a core trading pool** with the potential to take a significant share of the total wstETH volume on Optimism.
> 
> * **E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD.** However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs)
*** 

> As a new pool design with more customizable concentrated liquidity, this pool has the potential to significantly expand the BeethovenX offering. The pool design even supports asymmetric liquidity concentration. Current LSTs may be locked on Curve and Balancer, but are disproportionately traded on Uniswap and KyberSwap (c.f. below graphic).
> 
> Gyroscope’s E-CLPs could change the LST landscape of BeethovenX by becoming low-slippage trading pools. However, some initial incentives may be required to bootstrap the pool and get to a minimum TVL that unlocks the pool’s potential. As demonstrated by the [stMATIC E-CLP](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/polygon/e-clp/0xf0ad209e2e969eaaa8c882aac71f02d8a047d5c2/), this amount, although necessary, does not need to be that large for the pool to be competitive, after which the pool can grow organically.

# Specifications

* ## Governance

> The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.

* ## Oracles

> * rateProvider0 (for WETH): 0x0 (none)
> * rateProvider1 (for wstETH): 0x9aa3cd420f830E049e2b223D0b07D8c809C94d15
> * (ETH per stETH wrapping rate)

* ## Audits

> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/audit-reports) (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.

* ## Centralization vectors

> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.

* ## Market History

> This pool has just been created. As such, there is no relevant market history for this pair in this pool. Ample historic data is available for this asset pair in different pools, e.g. on [BeethovenX on Optimism](https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb200020000000000000000008b) or on [Balancer Ethereum](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x32296969ef14eb0c6d29669c550d4a0449130230000200000000000000000080). For contract addresses of the wstETH E-CLP refer to the below ‘Contracts’ section.

* ## Value

> As per “Motivation”. Other Optimism pools with LSTs exist, but none of them feature asymmetrically concentrated liquidity. Asymmetric concentrated liquidity for these assets could become a substantial driver of trading volume and total value locked.

343,"## Summary

A proposal to renew Gauntlet’s 12-month engagement with Aave on continuous market risk management to maximize capital efficiency while minimizing the risk of insolvency and liquidations to create long-term sustainable growth. For more details, see the full forum post [here]( https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-aave-renewal-2023/15380 ).


## Proposal 

Since 2021, Gauntlet has been serving the DAO formally. Gauntlet’s Risk Management platform quantifies risk, optimizes risk parameters, runs economic stress tests, and calibrates parameters dynamically. We use agent-based simulation models tuned to actual market data to model tail market events and interactions between different users within DeFi protocols. Our simulations are constructed analogously to how transaction-level backtesting is done in high-frequency and algorithmic trading. Our platform provides similar statistical power in these actuarial analyses by modifying these techniques to handle the idiosyncrasies of cryptocurrencies.

Gauntlet’s features will cover Aave V2, Aave V3, GHO (new), and Insolvency Refund.


The annual fee will be a fixed fee of $1,600,000. This will be 50% in GHO and 50% in aUSDT.  

- 30% of the total annual fee (480,000 in aUSDT) will be deposited in a vault for the insolvency refund.
- The remaining 320,000 in aUSDT and 800,000 GHO will be streamed linearly over 1 year.


Full details of the engagement scope, roadmap, expectations, and KPIs are covered in our [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-aave-renewal-2023/15380).

346,"Problem:
Burning money is losing the funds of all people's investments, and cake will be printed until it has yes or yes 750M coins. This is damaging the crypto community because little by little the coins will be sold and devalued by SWAP, only to burn and give room to print more CaKE.

Solution:
Instead of BURNING, I propose that this 0.0575% burn be added to a smart contract, which keeps the funds as savings and distributes them depending on the amount of coins you have, EXAMPLE:

10,000 CAKE accumulated in 1 week, released annually at 5%:
For days they would be released from a: 1.36 CAKE



A year has passed and 600,000 CAKE have already been accumulated, the release will be 5% per year:
For days they would be released from a: 82.19 CAKE


These Cake would be released as follows and can choose:

1-To those who only have CAKE blocked ""depending on the weeks they are distributed"".
This would increase the Staking day by day

2-The same thing mentioned above plus those who Farm ONLY with CAKE.

As the transactions would be forever, Staking would increase more and more the more Cake is exchanged, this would be good because Inflation is not needed to pay those who do Farming or Staking, Only the already existing funds would be used, but they would be blocked and only 5% return per year. In 20 years the first frozen CAKE would be returning.

That is just an example, but with inflation and the coins returned, CAKE's Staking would practically rise day by day, and the longer it lasts Blocked, the higher the reward for these 2 mechanisms would be, so CAKE would become stronger and more attractive. .

If CAKE had no inflation, this method could be used to reward CAKE blockers. This would be better than inflation and currency burning.

Inflation can continue until it reaches 750M, but the Coins that are Frozen by the transactions in Swaps would be counted.

If you want you can also allocate the burning of, Sale of NFT, PREDICTIONS or whatever you can imagine.

This would be more Beneficial than burning, because burning just removes the market cap of the other cryptocurrencies to ""BENEFIT ONE"" while this coin gets printed more and more.",neutral

349,"**Proposal Summary**
Blockchain@Columbia, in conjunction with the Fantom and Axelar Team, are proposing to deploy Uniswap V3 on Fantom Chain. Given the BSL expiry, it is crucial for Uniswap to establish market share in other ecosystems. Deployment on Fantom would be beneficial to both Uniswap and Fantom. 

**Overview of Fantom**
Fantom Chain is a highly scalable and secure smart-contract platform designed to enable rapid deployment of dApps. Powered by its unique Directed Acyclic Graph framework and an advanced consensus mechanism, Fantom offers fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. Its innovative architecture has attracted numerous projects and developers.

**Motivation**
As an industry leader, Uniswap has established a strong presence in the DeFi space. In order to maintain its competitive edge, Uniswap must continue to adapt and expand its reach to other blockchain networks. This strategic move will capitalize on current market opportunities and strengthen Uniswap's position in the DeFi landscape.
Axelar is chosen for a number of reasons:
1. The Axelar Network boasts a decentralized Proof of Stake protocol, multiple layers of security features, and the ability to further customize security for Uniswap, if needed. This ensures a robust and secure bridge solution for Uniswap governance.
2. Axelar Network is reliable and has capacity to handle large-scale projects. The Axelar Network has been live for over a year, integrating more than 30 chains with 70 validators through its stack, processing over $1.8 billion in volume, and integrating with major DEXs, wallets, L1/L2, stablecoins, and other projects in the industry.
3. Axelar offers customization options for Uniswap, such as non-upgradable contracts, or contracts governed by Uniswap delegates or UNI token holders. Additionally, Axelar's network can be upgraded following delegated proof-of-stake consensus, ensuring continuous improvements and adaptability.
4. Axelar's General Message Passing capability enables developers building on one chain to call any function on any other connected chain, ensuring complete composability across Web3.
5. Axelar's security model combines a decentralized permissionless network, engineering best practices, and application-level security add-ons to offer robust security for Uniswap's deployment on Fantom.

**Outlook**
	While Fantom’s time in the spotlight has somewhat passed since “DeFi Summer”, the ecosystem still boasts a significant amount of TVL, hovering around $450 million for the majority of the past year with steady growth (DeFiLlama). There is a clear demand for decentralized exchanges on Fantom as four of the top ten protocols are decentralized exchanges, so there’s no doubt that Uniswap will be the leading DEX while also facilitating swaps for currently unavailable pairs. 
	Additionally, the Fantom Foundation has consistently worked to reduce the staking requirements for validators from 3.175m FTM in 2021 to 500,000 FTM. As the requirements needed to validate the network decreases, more users will be able to participate in the validation process.
	Fantom Chain's dedication to the Ethereum ecosystem is evident in its interoperability efforts, developer resources, and focus on driving the growth of decentralized finance. The Fantom team is also committed to fostering collaboration with Ethereum through Axelar Network to enable smooth asset transfers within the two ecosystems. We are convinced that deploying Uniswap on Fantom Chain offers numerous advantages to both Uniswap Labs and its users. 
	We estimate that 30% of the current DEX volume on Fantom would be routed to Uniswap should deployment occur. DEX volume on Fantom is available on DeFiLlama. Uniswap would receive an estimated $30-40 million in volume per week based on the data above as well as deployment on an highly-compatible, low cost chain to test new products and attract users.  

**Engagement Terms**
The deployment and its costs will be borne by the Fantom Foundation and Axelar. As such, no grants or subsidies will be offered to Uniswap. Axelar and Fantom will handle the backend deployment of the smart contracts; however, Uniswap will need to handle the frontend. 

**Bridge Security**

_Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?_
-Yes, arbitrary message passing was described in the Axelar white paper in January 2021, and Axelar released its General Message Passing (GMP) capability to mainnet in April 2022. For example, GMP enables developers building on one chain to call any function on any other connected chain. (We use the word “function” to encompass both smart contracts at the application layer and functions built at the protocol layer, as in Cosmos, for example.) That means complete composability across Web3.
-Like all Axelar functions, General Message Passing relies on a permissionless validator set (delegated proof-of-stake) for security and a decentralized protocol that handles routing and translation.

_Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?_
Robust security comes from (a) the right design, (b) engineering practices, and (c) application-level security add-ons:

(A) The Design: A decentralized permissionless network with a many-to-many communication model. The decentralized and permissionless model has the best practical security guarantees as it encourages diverse validator deployments, incentivizes validators to guard their keys, promotes good behavior, and punishes bad behavior.
-Axelar is the full-stack decentralized transport layer. At the core, it is powered by delegated proof-of-stake consensus to validate cross-chain messages. Applications can instantiate additional validation logic across connected paths 3 that may be governed by the application token, permissioned set, light-client, zk proofs, or other available technologies. Our approach is to:
(a) Offer the best-in-class security via decentralization as the default that solves most use cases for developers.
(b) Allow developers to customize security as needed.
-The Axelar network itself comprises a validator set responsible for maintaining the network and executing transactions, running the Cross-Chain Gateway Protocol, a multi-party cryptography overlay that sits on top of a Layer-1 blockchain. 
-Axelar Gateways are effectively smart contracts that connect the Axelar network to its interconnected external chains. Validators monitor Gateways for incoming transactions, which the validators READ. They then reach a consensus on the validity of that transaction and, once agreed, WRITE to the destination chain’s Gateway to execute the cross-chain transaction.
-The validators and Gateways compose the core infrastructure layer. It’s important to note that relaying across Axelar and its interconnected networks is completely permissionless. This guarantees that no one can censor user transactions and delivers 100% liveness guarantees (assuming the interconnected networks and the Axelar network are running). If relayers are down, the user or anyone else can post transactions, themselves. If one of the interconnected networks is halted or undergoing an upgrade, the packets are just queued up at the network layer and can subsequently be posted (or re-posted) when the networks are back up.
-Proof-of-stake decentralized design at the core - Axelar is built using battle-tested delegated proof-of-stake consensus with a diverse and dynamic validator set that is open to all.
-To further decentralize the network, cross-chain messages are approved if they’re authorized via the quadratic voting rule. That is, the voting power of each validator is equivalent to the square root of their stake. A threshold of validators (currently 60%), weighted by the square root of the stakes, must collectively co-authorize every cross-chain request. With quadratic voting, as validators accumulate stake, it gets harder for them to accumulate voting power.
-Amplify stake security - With Interchain Security available in the Cosmos ecosystem in the coming months, one network can “borrow” the security of other networks. This would allow it to increase the stake used for validation on the network, making any economic attack much more difficult. We also have plans to allow ETH holders to contribute to Axelar’s security, via the restaking model that Eigenlayer introduced recently.

(B) Engineering and Operational Practices
-Key rotations on the network - Validators of the Axelar network maintain keys that allow them to co-authorize cross-chain requests, similarly to how they co-authorize every block on the blockchain. 
-Continuous unit tests & end-to-end tests through the stack - Continuous unit tests and end-to-end tests help discover vulnerabilities and bugs early in the pipeline.
-Audits and bug bounties (see above).

(C) Application-Level Security Add-Ons
-Customize security - Additional paths can be secured by deploying additional validator sets, light-clients, and/or zero-knowledge proofs when available. We think this will be the best instantiation for the Uniswap community: leverage the robust Axelar network for all default traffic. If there is a highly valuable/sensitive transaction, utilize the additional UNI elected validator set for co-signing. See the Appendix for more details on how we propose customizing security for Uniswap.
-Rate limits - The Gateways and the Axelar network have a rate-limiting function, which limits how much of each asset can be transferred in a given time interval.

Sitting atop the validators and Gateways are Axelar services and APIs that enable developers to access the tools and infrastructure enabled by those validators and Gateways. These services and APIs do not add any security assumptions.

_Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?_
A majority of Axelar validators attest to messages that pass from Ethereum to a destination chain. The voting threshold is 60%, based on the validator’s quadratic stake (current stake distribution: Validators | Axelarscan). An adversary who can corrupt 60% of voting power can pass fraudulent messages. The adversary could try to corrupt enough servers to do this, but mechanisms such as key rotations & rate limits minimize the potential of these attacks.

_What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?_
-Axelar validators get slashed on the Cosmos SDK level, the same way that validators of any other Cosmos chains get slashed for misbehavior.
-There is a penalty for validators who don’t maintain sufficient uptime. When a validator doesn’t vote on enough cross-chain events, they’re penalized with a loss of stake and rewards.
-Validators who misbehave significantly (double signing blocks, not participating for a long period of time) get jailed.

Within the TM consensus rewards, rewards slashing rules are set as follows:
-Validators will lose the TM Consensus rewards if they lose liveness and get jailed if they don’t participate for a longer duration.
-Validators need to sign 50% of the blocks in every 35,000-block window.
-Given a block time of five seconds, this corresponds to maintaining total liveness for at least one day in every two-day window.
-They lose 0.01% of rewards per block for downtime and 2% for double signing blocks.

If the validators lose liveness for more than 50% of the window, then they are locked (“jailed” in Cosmos terminology, forbidden from rejoining the validator set) for two hours (about 1,440 blocks), after which they would need to unlock themselves. Axelar network implements an unbonding period of seven days.

_Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?_
-Yes, the Axelar network code has been audited over 30 times and continues to go through continuous and rigorous audits. 
-There is also a $2.25 million bug bounty program on Immunefi.
-Axelar network and contracts are all open-source to encourage white-hat revisions

Once a cross-chain deployment method is finalized in the future, we wholeheartedly support changing current deployment mechanisms to fit the new process. However, given the urgency of this proposal, we believe that the currently proposed deployment with Axelar is needed. 

**Timeline**
After the completion of the on-chain vote, Axelar will handle Uniswap V3 smart contract deployments on Fantom while Uniswap Labs handles the front-end integration. This is estimated to take ~4-6 weeks with audits.",neutral

351,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Back Chromia ($CHR) to Syrup Pool!

CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from **Chromia**. Chromia is a Layer-1 and Layer-2 relational blockchain that aims to solve the scalability problem for dApps. A relational blockchain is a combination of a relational database and blockchain platform. 

#### What is Boost?

Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, the CHR-BUSD farm will go to a 1x multiple for 48 hours, then 0.5x thereafter. Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the boosted period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.
 
At the same time, there will be a delicious, new CHR Syrup Pool with 1,365,000 CHR tokens to be earned by staking CAKE. Get your CAKE ready!

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn CHR tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 1,365,000 CHR
- **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on June 3rd 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on July 3rd 2022
- **Token rewards per block:** 1.580 CHR

#### Max Stake per wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### What is $CHR?

From the team: “CHR is the native token of Chromia's ecosystem. The main use cases of CHR are as follows:

- CHR is utilized for staking and liquidity provision
- Users can use CHR tokens within dApps on Chromia, and in turn, the dApps pay transaction fees to block producers in CHR tokens
- Developers can earn CHR tokens through their dApps on Chromia

Chromia boasts a rapidly growing ecosystem which spans various sectors including gaming, NFTs, DeFi, supply chain and tokenization of real estate.”

These replacements have been completed on Ethereum and remain ongoing on Polygon, Arbitrum, and Fantom. You can see the most up to date list of signers [here](https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/governance/multisig). In order to ensure the activities of the DAO Multisig can continue uninterrupted we should replenish our list of available replacements. Thus, I propose adding the following people to the approved list of replacements:

* Lewis, Stablecoin Labs / Gyroscope (0xbcf751dBfe314Ee96A660EFA2Fcb259CBc364c29)
* Mounir, Paraswap (0x0951ff0835302929d6c0162b3d2495a85e38ec3a)

**Protocol Description:**

[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer

Renzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.

Renzo introduces the Balancer Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.

**Motivation:**

Renzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.

**Specifications:**
 
Governance:

Renzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.

Oracles:

Renzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.

Audits:

Renzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)

Centralization vectors:

Centralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.

Market history:

Renzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a). Both pools are in the top 6 on Balancer on Ethereum by TVL.

Renzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects.

Value: The ezETH/wstETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum.

    Based on Michael Egorov's proposal, published on Novermer 5th 2023,  the main aim is to deploy Venus Protocol on the Ethereum Mainnet. This decision is driven by the fact that Ethereum has the highest liquidity and capital deployed, making it a favorable platform for on-chain trades. 

Furthermore, the proposal suggests listing Curve tokens, crvUSD and CRV, as collaterals on Ethereum, along with proposing CRV/XVS rewards for the benefit of the Venus community, Curve ecosystem, and Ethereum as a whole. 

The rationale behind this proposal is threefold. Firstly, the Ethereum Mainnet requires more lending protocols, and the presence of Venus would help to fill this gap. 

Secondly, deploying Venus on the Ethereum Mainnet would create visibility and brand awareness for the protocol. 

Lastly, Curve, being a leading AMM with a stablecoin (crvUSD) that maintains a close peg, aims to be present in all lending protocols and enhance adoption for crvUSD. 

The proposal also outlines the details for the core pool on Venus, isolated pools on Venus, liquidity mining incentive for crvUSD suppliers, and the creation of pools on Curve. The plan includes setting supply and borrow caps for different assets, such as crvUSD, CRV, and other stablecoins, as well as incentivizing liquidity providers with CRV rewards. 

Additionally, the proposal suggests creating various pools on Curve, such as VAI/crvUSD, XVS/crvUSD, and XVS/VAI on the Ethereum Mainnet. The aim is to help Venus assets find liquidity and facilitate the creation of these pools on BSC once Curve is deployed there. 

Finally, the proposal highlights the importance of obtaining a gauge for the curve pool, which would allow liquidity providers to receive CRV tokens as rewards. This gauge would require a positive vote from Curve Dao, and owning veCRV or other veCRV liquid tokens would grant voting rights. 

Overall, the proposal aims to deploy Venus on the Ethereum Mainnet, list Curve tokens, incentivize liquidity providers, and collaborate with Curve to create pools that benefit the Venus community, Curve ecosystem, and the broader Ethereum network.",neutral
355,"#### ABSTRACT

To produce 12 independent animations with a run time of 1 minute each.

This proposal introduces an ecosystem-wide casting call to all eligible IP Holders powered by ApeCoin. The animators of Atrium have experience with Disney, Pixar, HBO, Netflix & more and await the opportunity to co-create with community members. Funding this proposal showcases ApeCoin’s dedication to providing new avenues for creators and results in 12 animations under a “Legend of ApeCoin” theme.

Rationale of Value Added to ApeCoin

- In an increasingly digital landscape, content rules permanence and brand recall. Good brands build timeless content that fans can anchor on. That in turn creates an increasingly valuable ecosystem around it. As the canon storylines are created officially by Yuga, this proposal to the ApeCoin DAO community has a unique opportunity to co-create equally memorable characters and storylines that are completely driven bottoms-up.
- Being crypto native and having highly experienced talent from the animation industry (Pixar, Sony, Netflix, Dreamworks, Marvel), Atrium is uniquely positioned to work with ApeCoin DAO to create content that appeals to mainstream audience, bring more awareness to an already lovable crypto-native brand and deliver co-created cinematic content.

How does this benefit DAO + DAO members?

- ApeCoin DAO produces the storylines the community creates involving the ApeCoin brand.
- Co-create with crypto native network of qualified animators and filmmakers.
- Reinforces top of mind for community-produced content on all social channels (Atrium’s previously created content has recorded millions of impressions and hundreds of thousands of views in aggregate).
- Crypto native distribution mechanism of artifacts used in the production (content viewing, companion mints all made available free to the community members)

Based on the overall reception of the pilot short-film series, if community wants to expand on any specific storyline - Atrium will have logistics In place to build out the series with follow-up proposal.

What is Atrium?

Atrium is a blockchain-backed network of artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, Voice Actors, and Music production.

Securing top-quality creative talent who are well versed in the NFT space and committed to supporting the long-term growth of an ecosystem is extraordinarily difficult. Here at Atrium, we have curated and nurtured a collective of outstanding animators, illustrators, storytellers, and all-around remarkable creatives.Take a look at a few of our creators below.

356,"First, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to farms – the per block allocation to Farms and Lottery will remain at [**3.75 CAKE/block**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/Qme8aLLxh7UeAmiAxcUie7FWvSrBYdmNMFtHhGdMTFEFKX).

Importantly, the purpose of these proposals is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. In other words, redistributing farm rewards from the farms mentioned below will boost APRs for all other farms.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more capacity to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

# Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list alUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave. alUSD has established itself as one of the leading new stablecoins in terms of stability and liquidity, and listing on Aave will provide users with a proven stablecoin to borrow. Alchemix has 376m TVL in the form of yvDAI and DAI backing alUSD, with a liquid supply of 239m alUSD. alUSD has one of the deepest Curve pools, with ~450m in liquidity. In addition to the Curve pool, alUSD has additional liquidity on Sushiswap, Saddle, and mStable. According to Parsec Finance’s StableRank, alUSD is routinely among the top stablecoins in terms of price stability and liquidity within 1% slippage. Having been on the market for over 6 months while maintaining the peg through turbulent market conditions, alUSD has built the reputation required to be an asset listed on AAVE.

# About Alchemix and alUSD
Alchemix is an evolution of the tried and true CDP model trailblazed by MakerDAO. Alchemix is, at its core, an overcollateralized stablecoin, much like DAI and other similar tokens. It has some key differences however.

Alchemix only mints like-kind or “mirror” al-Assets. For example, alUSD is only mintable by DAI (and later USDT and USDC), and alETH is only mintable by ETH (and later other ETH derivatives). Deposited collateral is then deployed to yearn, of which the earned yield doubly repays users’ debt and backs the dollar peg in the Transmuter module. In addition, there is no interest paid in the borrowing of al-Assets. Due to this structure, Alchemix does not have liquidations in its system. This allows people to maximum borrow without fear of shifting market conditions - taking an essentially risk free negative interest alUSD loan with their DAI. In effect, the system acts as a way to get an advance on your yield for your stablecoin deposits.

Alchemix ensures the alUSD peg with the following mechanisms.
1. 50% LTV for minting alUSD, which prevents excessive recursive leverage in the protocol.
2. DAO-managed debt caps that limit the over-minting of alUSD
3. The ability to repay debt in alUSD or DAI. If alUSD is under the peg, people can buy it off the market and repay their loan at a discount. If alUSD is over the peg, users can sell alUSD to DAI and repay with DAI to arbitrage the price, and they can self-liquidate their collateral to mint more alUSD to trade to DAI for arbitrage.
4. The Transmuter module guarantees 1:1 conversions of alUSD to DAI, the conversion process isn’t instant, but it can present good arbitrage opportunities, which helps to stabilize the peg.
5. Alchemix rewards ALCX governance tokens for alUSD liquidity providers, which attracts liquidity to the pool, further boosting the peg.

alUSD minted from a new loan has a collateralization ratio of 200%, while alUSD minted from repaid debt has a collateralization ratio of 100%. The total global collateralization ratio for alUSD is 157%. The supply can expand in two ways – an expansion in the debt ceiling followed by users taking new loans, or debt repayments with DAI, which decrement the global debt while not destroying alUSD. This is how we have a supply of ~239m with a current debt cap of 150m. alUSD can be burned by staking it in the transmuter, where it is converted 1:1 to DAI over time.

These mechanisms in tandem have allowed for alUSD to remain extremely close to the $1 peg since its inception.

# Motivation
alUSD has established itself as a reliable and liquid stablecoin. In addition to protocol improvements, Alchemix DAO believes that integrating alUSD throughout DeFi will help us in that goal. Because AAVE is the leading lending protocol across all of crypto, getting on AAVE as a borrowable asset would lend a lot of legitimacy to alUSD. The more tightly integrated alUSD is within DeFi, the more resilient it will become, which will allow alUSD to safely grow in supply.

Going forward, Alchemix will expand beyond our current set up of using DAI in the yvDAI yearn vault as collateral, and expand the selection of stablecoin collaterals and yield earning strategies. AAVE is one such source of yield that we are looking to plug into in the future. When these upgrades take place, we predict that Alchemix will be one of the larger liquidity providers to AAVE, similar to how Alchemix is currently one of the largest liquidity providers on Yearn.

# alUSD Benefits to Aave Users
alUSD is desirable to borrow because it is tightly pegged to DAI, USDC, USDT, mUSD, FEI, FRAX, and LUSD in our various markets. It is simple to swap between other stables. DEX aggregators make it simple to trade between alUSD and any other asset on Ethereum too. In addition, there are attractive farming incentives for alUSD LPs. For people that are looking to borrow alUSD but don’t have stablecoins from which to mint it, borrowing alUSD on AAVE will provide more options to get alUSD. The alUSD can be used for yield farming, or through highly liquid swaps into other stable coins, to finance their personal life or to speculate on the market. alUSD is also used in an alETH/alUSD options market on premia.finance. Alchemix plans to continue to expand alUSD use cases in the future through partnerships and integrations.

# Security Considerations and Risk Analysis
Certik Audit for the Core Contracts: https://alchemix.fi/a208baf6ca7e0d6b0116461f05e27cd9.pdf

Currently, the Alchemix protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol controls the alUSD debt cap and collateralization ratio through DAO voting, which is then executed by a community + developer multisig + timelock contract. The DAO prioritizes peg stability above all else when considering parameter changes.

Aave has already conducted risk analysis on DAI, the current sole backing stablecoin of alUSD, and assigned an overall risk rating of B+ [Risks per Asset - Risk](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risks-per-asset). USDC and USDT strategies will be added as alUSD collateral later. USDC and USDT have ratings of A- and B+ respectively. The new risks from introducing alUSD are Alchemix/alUSD and Yearn Vault contract risks. Risk to Aave is minimized due to alUSD being enabled for borrowing but not as collateral.

The Alchemix DAO multisig and timelock wallet is the administrator for the alUSD token. It has the ability to grant and revoke other contracts the minter role. Currently, all alUSD minting is handled by the alchemist.sol contract. When we launch our version two, the new contracts will also be granted the minting permissions. Alchemix employs a modular approach where the Transmuter and Vault Adapter modules can be swapped out and replaced with upgraded versions. The core alchemist.sol contract cannot be upgraded, but the multisig and timelock wallet can change the following parameters: collateralization ratio, debt ceiling, and fee percentage. Each member of the core Alchemix development team has permission to enable Alchemix’s sentinel mode, which pauses the contract in case of an emergency.

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Deploy AURA to vlAURA
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @Sisyphos & @efecarranza 
created: 2023-11-26

---

# Summary

This publication proposes transferring the AURA holding from the Ethereum Treasury to the GHO Liquidity Committee (GLC) SAFE. 

# Motivation

The Aave DAO holds [845,090.43 vlAURA](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc0c293ce456ff0ed870add98a0828dd4d2903dbf?a=0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60) on the GLC SAFE and also [443,674 AURA](https://etherscan.io/token/0xC0c293ce456fF0ED870ADd98a0828Dd4d2903DBF?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) in the Treasury. This publication proposes transferring the AURA from the Treasury to GLC SAFE and consolidating the vlAURA holding. The GLC is to lock the AURA for vlAURA.

The Aave DAO is expected to receive 413,849.57 units of vlAURA upon locking 443,674 AURA. 

The Aave DAO will benefit by earning yield, 3.10% APR in [auraBAl](https://app.aura.finance/#/1/lock) from holding vlAURA. In addition, the GLC has delegated the vlAURA to Paladin to earn additional yield. It is our understanding this is temporary strategy until Balancer liquidity pools feature as part of the overal GHO liquidity strategy. 

At the time of writing, delegating vlAURA to Paladin is generating approximately 0.0135 USD per week per vlAURA. This is roughly $11k per week and an annualise yield >65%. The yield offered by Paladin from vlAURA delegation is nominated in USDC. This is on par with yield offered by Hidden Hand. 

![Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 14.04.20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJi7RXRVa.png)

The GLC is tasked with managing the vlAURA holding on behalf of the Aave DAO. 

# Specification

This proposal encompasses the following actions:

* Transfer all AURA to GLC SAFE Address

GLC SAFE Address: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`

366,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes PearDAO ($PEX) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with PearDAO! A DAO managed decentralized marketplace that aims to allow the trade of all things in a free, open and independent trading ecosystem. PearDAO is built for the community and Web3 – dedicated to the exchange of values between off-chain, on-chain and cross-chain environments, all at once.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn PEX tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 334,000 PEX
 - **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on March 31st 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on April 30th 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.3865 PEX 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the PEX Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a PEX-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the farm period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.

#### What is $PEX?

From the team: “All trades on PearDAO are facilitated by PEX tokens. PEX also acts as the governance token to allow all holders to take part in building and managing the PearDAO platform.

* **Earn**: Fees collected by the network will be distributed among all PearDAO traders as trading rewards   
* **Stake**: Stake PEX tokens to earn in the PearDAO Farm, such as PEX-BNB LP Pool and PEX Pool (Coming Soon)
* **Governance**: PEX holders can propose and vote to determine the platform’s future development
* **Payment**: PEX tokens act as the utility token to submit appeals to the DAO members and to prioritize users’ ad ranking on the PearDAO Marketplace through ad spot bidding”

Imagine a “Love, Death & Robots” like anthology, but each episode happenes on a random plot of land from the Otherside world. Each plot of land is like a small parallel universe with it’s own environment and rules based on it’s traits. Main characters are from the APE ecosystem. Each season or episode has a different style and genre.

For the pilot I am thinking about a horror style with a BAYC character as a charismatic antagonist.

Title: [ARFC]  Retroactive bug bounties proposal (pre-Immunefi)

Author: BGD Labs @bgdlabs

Date: 2024-01-09

---

## Summary

Request for bounties pending from before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi official bug bounty program, amounting a grand total of $86’500.

**The objective of this ARFC is to pre-authorise such payments, to be processed via an on-chain AIP**

## Motivation

Before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty program on [September 25th 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/325/), security reports by white hats where evaluated in an ad-hoc basis, proposing bounties/rewards following an approach like on [this proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077). That was not optimal, as there was no formal scope defined, or strict ranges of bounties depending on severity and impact.

Currently, every report is being processed via Immunefi and the rules of the Aave program, however, there were other reports submitted via other channel before that (usually security@aave.com). As these reports should be evaluated at time of submission for fairness, and outside of the Immunefi scope defined afterwards, we think it is a good idea to reward them separately and retro-actively outside the program.

## Specification

### Reports

First of all, we want to clarify certain aspects for the community:

- The proposed rewards and evaluation metrics follow the ones we did ad-hoc in the past [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077#clarification-on-evaluation-2), as we don’t think it is fair for the white-hats to apply the rewards ranges on the current Immunefi program and out-of-scope rules, as they were defined afterwards.
- In one of the cases, we recommended the white hat to submit the report via Immunefi, in order to have access to the mediation procedure of the platform. As this mediation process was finally requested by the white hat, Immunefi charges the corresponding fee of 10% of the amount, which we think is legitimate.
- At the moment, *we are not disclosing the full details of some of the reports*, because even if none of them create any risk for Aave now, one has dependencies with another report (not disclosed yet) and the other could increase risk to non-Aave entities.


### 1. Inconsistent validation on  Aave v2/v3

When calling `borrow()` with stable rate mode on Aave v2 and v3, one of the validations is that not more than a percentage of the total available liquidity can be borrowed at once.

However, `swapBorrowRateMode()` doesn’t validate the same, which is unexpected and could lead to more stable rate borrowings than intended.

It is important to highlight that this is not possible at the moment, with minting of stable rate disabled.


**Severity:  Low**

The issue didn’t create any immediate problem in the protocol, but overexposure to stable rate mode is not expected.

**Likelihood:  Certain**

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.

**Proposed bounty:** 10’000 USD

---

### 2. Inconsistent HF (Health Factor) behaviour swap borrow rate mode

When swapping borrow rate mode, the HF of an user is not validated, as debt should remain the same. However, under edge scenarios, the HF of an user could slightly change (by ~1 unit of lowest asset’s decimals).


**Severity:  No impact**

This is not a bug or creates any exploit scenario, but it is unexpected behaviour.

**Likelihood:  Certain**

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.

**Proposed bounty:** 5’000 USD

---

### 3. Price manipulation of asset listed on Aave

By executing a complex strategy (involving compromising the asset’s trusted infrastructure), it could be possible to inflate the price of one of the assets listed on Aave v2.

Even if this belongs more to the centralisation risk of the asset, and we don’t consider a bug of the protocol, it was taken into account for off-boarding consideration of the asset by risk providers of Aave, and we believe it is fair to reward retro-actively.

As this risk still exist on the asset itself and more protocols could be using it, even if we don’t really see any immediate risk, we will not be disclosing at the moment details of it, until the team applies extra measures.


**Severity:  Critical**

Being a price manipulation, the impact on the protocol would hypotetically be important.

**Likelihood: Not likely**

The attack involves compromising asset’s infrastructure (which would directly disqualify on the current Aave <> Immunefi program), together with extra techniques; so we consider it theoretically possible, but highly improbable.

**Proposed bounty:** 65’000 USD. Additionally, 6’500 USD as Immunefi fee.

If this ARFC is positive, afterwards we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal, releasing the funds to the corresponding addresses.",bullish

374,"Summary

The proposal aims to establish a partnership between Gitcoin and Venus to implement quadratic funding and direct grants, with a total funding ask of $150,000. 

This funding will be divided into $50,000 for a Quadratic Funding round and $100,000 for direct grants to support innovative projects within the Venus ecosystem. Gitcoin also requests a 10% fee to assist with designing and implementing these initiatives. 

The Quadratic Funding mechanism enables the Venus community to democratically support projects by voting with their contributions. This inclusive model emphasizes community involvement and support. The Direct Grants mechanism provides targeted financial assistance to projects of strategic importance, ensuring their growth and success within the ecosystem. 

The expected outcomes include stimulating innovation and growth, increasing community engagement, and strategically enhancing the Venus ecosystem.

To proceed, the proposal needs approval from the Venus Protocol community, collaborative planning with Gitcoin, and the implementation and oversight of the funding initiatives. This partnership between Gitcoin and Venus aims to leverage community engagement and strategic funding to foster innovation and growth within the ecosystem.

Conclusion

If approved, this collaboration has the potential to significantly benefit the Venus community and support the development of innovative projects within the ecosystem.",neutral

376,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-activate-sourcecred-program/2176).

As some may recall, governance approved sourcecred under [this vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmXQpKyw1BvYgZtvC2KGqrDezWBfSUBEKK77Kx866yBLYf) but the integration was never completed. Someone from sourcecred reached out to me recently and has gotten it nearly ready to use. The final piece of the puzzle is approving compensation for the team responsible for maintaining it.

## Motivation

You can read the previous vote for some context but this generally fits in with our goal of rewarding ground floor community contributors. It will be as simple as a Baller or Balancer Labs employee dropping a certain emoji on a community member’s discord message and that person will earn a small amount of BAL (one example).

From what I have been told, maintaining the sourcecred instance has social, administrative, IT, accounting, and transactional components. There will be a team of people responsible for handling all of this. **They are requesting 150-200 BAL per month.**

## Specification

It has been suggested internally that we apply a period of time to this rather than leaving it open ended. Thus, **I propose an 8 week trial period where the ecosystem fund will allocate 50 BAL per week to rewarding contributors (same as previous vote) and allocate 150 BAL per month to the sourcecred team for expenses.** At the conclusion of the trial period, governance will vote again to continue or not and at what rates. The 8 week period will begin once everything is in place which should be soon after this vote passes but can’t commit to a hard date at this time.

Total spend: 50 BAL x 8 weeks = 400 BAL for contributors
150 BAL x 2 months = 300 BAL for sourcecred team",bearish

> The initial gauge proposal for COIL/USDC passed as BIP-266 [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-266-enable-coil-usdc-gauge-w-2-cap-ethereum/4656). During the gauge creation process, there was concern regarding a 10% or 2% cap and a mistake occurred where the 2% cap gauge was made incorrectly. It directs to the 10% cap gauge itself, as opposed to the COIL/USDC pool. This oversight in process was caught during the execution* process by the Balancer Maxi team, but initial mistake was made by myself. I am proposing the approval of the gauge remade correctly to be activated, and killing of the current gauge based on the specifications below.

379,"**Summary:**
> This pool uses the new composable stable pool factory which allows us to apply the protocol fee to yield bearing tokens. bb-rf-aUSDC is `Beets Reaper Aave Boosted USDC`, which means we're using a linear pool to deposit USDC into a Reaper USDC Vault which only deposits into Aave. Reaper handles the autocompounding of any OP rewards which adds additional yield. For reference, Reaper is a fork of Yearn v2 run by the Byte Masons who are talented developers in their own right. BeethovenX has a close working relationship with the Byte Masons. In the absence of an Aave v3 compatible atoken wrapper this arrangement represents the best path forward, and arguably it's better than using a wrapper since we get the additional compounding benefit. The kind of vault we're using has held 9 figures of TVL and been thoroughly battle tested so it should add a negligible risk premium.

**Protocol Description:**

> USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO. USDT is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Tether.

**Motivation:**

> This Aave boosted 3pool will form the cornerstone of our USD stable liquidity on Optimism. The boosted APR currently stands at 3.78% which means there is quite high intrinsic yield to this pool that will persist even without our token incentives. Note that this is *after* our 50% yield fee so this is very lucrative liquidity to have. Our friends at Qi DAO are the first to co-incentivize MAI/bb-rf-aUSD and we hope to secure more partnerships like this to build around the high base yield of this pool.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Find more information about MarkerDAO governance [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/). USDC and USDT are centralized and don't have governance.

2. **Oracles:** This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned.

3. **Audits:** See [here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports).

4. **Centralization vectors:** There are centralization risks with USDC, DAI, and USDT, though the market has clearly accepted those as minor for now.

5. **Market History:** See [here]([https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin)). 
 
6. **Value:** We will earn the protocol fee on bb-rf-aUSD yield, plus trading fees. As a reminder, protocol fees on Optimism are split 50% to Balancer (passively to DAO & veBAL) and 50% to BeethovenX. Of BeethovenX's 50%, half is returned as incentives on Optimism pools either via bribes or direct LM. The other half is split between funding the team and accumulating veBAL/auraBAL/vlAURA per this [recent proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x3d6e0373f0f1c041a82e6108a01aee2e00a21be43667259126b70e5fd2a5f93a). Thus emissions towards this gauge both benefit passive veBAL *and* serve to help our flywheel accelerate our growth on Optimism.

As a team of very passionate ApeCoin DAO & Yuga community members, we want to play our part in the success of ApeChain. And we will not only support it, but even amplify it.

Introducing Blever, a cutting-edge web3 platform combining NFTs with social farming & incentivized content creation. The platform empowers teams to effortlessly bring their creations to life while enjoying unparalleled hype & attention. By leveraging social login and seamless FIAT payments, Blever provides easy access to ApeChain not only for experienced users but also for casual players and retail.

In addition to gaming, you also need fun, culture, memes, and PFPs to make ApeChain appealing and popular. Blever is designed to do just that. We see ourselves as an extended community-driven business development arm. We search for projects, support their launch, and bring them tremendous reach and engagement through social farming. Everyone wins!

With $APE being the native gas token of ApeChain we believe that bringing users/traffic/projects to the chain is probably the single most important thing the DAO can focus on in the near future.

**Driving demand for ApeChain = Driving demand for $APE**

Easy access to ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE Incentives on ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE More use cases on ApeChain → more use cases for $APE ApeChain hype → $APE hype

This is our biggest opportunity and we want to do everything we can with Blever to make the most of it.

Having already invested more than 2 months of our time and resources, we are now looking for funding from the DAO to help us achieve our goal. Let’s make ApeChain a success together

Consider us to be an *external business development arm for ApeChain.* Via our platform, we will onboard creators, users, culture & fun to ApeChain. We have already started with outreach to various brands and projects + we have existing/confirmed partnerships as well.

*Maximizing reach & engagement* for projects that launch on ApeChain: easy access to social farming & incentivized content creation will ensure that they get the hype and attention they deserve.

*Easy ApeChain onboarding* with Social Login & FIAT payments
* Social Login will allow casual gamers & retail to sign up by using their traditional login methods (such as Google, X, Meta, etc.) - no wallet needed.
* FIAT payments will allow them to pay by Credit Card or other common payment methods.
* No gas fees - we will cover them on their behalf.

This combination will enable the simplest, fastest, and smoothest onboarding process for new users! No wallet, no crypto needed - a seamless web2.5 experience for everyone ; )

*Powered by Ape(Chain) branding* - permanently placed in our footer for 1 year.

*Joint marketing efforts* via our points system: we already had initial conversations with ApeCoin DAO members. Imagine $APE & ApeChain all over your timeline ; )

*Stackable multiplier for Apes* and other partner collections like (Kodas, Mocaverse, and more) in all social farming campaigns. Making sure that our fam & frens have a headstart.

381,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BSC etc.

If any of the terms are unclear, please ask our friendly community, or look at these articles on [**vesting**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/vesting-period).

# IFO Sale Details  
- **Sale start time:** ~1100 UTC on 4 Aug 2022 
- **Sale end time:** ~1200 UTC on 4 Aug 2022 
- **Amount to be raised:** $2,000,000 USD in CAKE tokens
- **Tokens to be sold:** 50,000,000 PEEL (5% of PEEL total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 PEEL = $0.040 USD
- **Token Vesting Schedule:** 30% will be unlocked at Sale end time (~1200 UTC), with the remaining 70% released block-by-block over 90 days.

All CAKE raised from the PEEL token sale will be given to the IFO project. Only CAKE raised from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Public Sale and Private Sale (Both conducted via the Overflow method).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

Basically, the more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent. More details below in the Overflow Multiplier Table.

# To participate in the IFO:

Refer to the [**IFO participation guide**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/ifo-initial-farm-offering/ifo-guide) and [**iCAKE article**](https://medium.com/pancakeswap/introducing-icake-ifo-updates-and-cake-side-pool-cc58983071d7).

**iCAKE and locked CAKE cannot be used to buy tokens in the IFO, so you would need a separate amount of CAKE to commit to the IFO.**

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Private Sale ($400,000, 20% of Sale allocation)

For the Private Sale, participants are required to own a [**Pancake Squad NFT**](https://pancakeswap.finance/pancake-squad), and [**set them as your Pancake Profile avatar**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/nft-profile-system/profile-guide). 

For this Private Sale, the maximum amount of funds that can be committed per user is **$800**, calculated based on the expected number of participants to ensure everyone can get a fair share.

The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session.

![](https://imgur.com/dpNPWkE.png)

#### Public Sale ($1,600,000, 80% of Sale Allocation)

As the name suggests, the Public Sale is open to all. However, this comes with a participation fee, which will be fully burned!

# The PEEL and SHELL Syrup Pools:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn PEEL!

- **Total Tokens:** 7,500,000 PEEL
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends
- **Finish time:** Approx. 60 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 4.340 PEEL

Stake CAKE tokens to earn SHELL!

- **Total Tokens:** 155,000,000 SHELL
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends
- **Finish time:** Approx. 60 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 89.699 SHELL

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 5 days, then unlimited CAKE staking thereafter – the cap will enable everyone to enjoy pool rewards at a high APY.

**For the first 5 days, you need an active PancakeSwap Profile in order to stake in the IFO Syrup Pool. No PancakeSwap Profile requirement thereafter.**

# The PEEL and SHELL Farms:

In order to host the PEEL Syrup Pool, we will need to provide a **PEEL-BUSD farm** that will have 2x CAKE rewards for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) and thereafter, 1x CAKE rewards.

In order to host the SHELL Syrup Pool, we will need to provide a **SHELL-BUSD farm** that will have 0.5x CAKE rewards for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) and thereafter, 0.1x CAKE rewards.

387,"This proposal is a continuation of the topic from VIP-51. Previously, several VRT Swap & XVS Vesting architecture designs were proposed that differed from the original design summarized in the Venus Tokenomics 2 published in August of 2021. One of these alternative designs, referred to as “fixed speed vesting” proposed a vesting schedule that would have allowed all XVS to vest very quickly if VRT was separated into a multitude of accounts and deposited separately. This potential workaround required a countermeasure in the form of a global daily limit on all deposits. Many in the community pointed out concerns regarding this daily limit from a technical and user experience perspective.

We considered feedback regarding the daily limit and how this unfairly allows those with bots to consume the daily quota before everyone else each day. There is no technically feasible way to prevent this issue with the fixed speed model, so we are proposing deployment of the original swap & vesting design.

389,"# Summary

This proposal seeks to gather Balancer community support and approval for Solace DAO to launch and operate a new Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora chain, an EVM within the NEAR ecosystem. This newly deployed protocol will be called Holdr, with the governance token HLDR, and ultimately governed by Holdr DAO.

# Abstract

If approved, this proposal will result in:

- Solace DAO launching Holdr as an officially recognized Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora
- Balancer DAO Treasury receiving 4% of HLDR total supply
- BAL tokenholders receiving 1% of HLDR total supply
- Solace DAO and Balancer DAO research and co-marketing collaboration

# Preface

This proposal is shared by Solace’s team and was written by Nikita Buzov (founder). Solace has received a grant of $20,000-worth of AURORA tokens from Aurora to pursue this proposal and launch a Balancer V2 friendly fork. Also, back in summer 2021, Solace DAO has also received a NEAR grant worth of $30,000 from NEAR Foundation to develop Solace, a DeFi Insurance protocol (live across Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Aurora). Therefore, Solace has been well supported and integrated within the NEAR ecosystem community, which, along with successful experience operating DeFi protocols, makes Solace team a natural partner within the Aurora’s and NEAR’s ecosystems.

# Motivation

Both NEAR and Aurora ecosystems have been steadily growing and developing their unique technology. Over the years they have shown a strong commitment to innovation and user experience, developer community, as well as security! Because of this continued growth, Solace is excited to support their ecosystem and, together with Aurora, identified a need for Balancer V2 technology to become present there.

# Background

Solace is a DeFi insurance protocol, founded back in 2020 and first launched in 2021 on Ethereum, later expanding to Polygon, Fantom, and Aurora. Over the past years Solace team has been awarded grants from Polygon, Aave, NEAR, Celer, and Aurora, following successful completion of the specified goals. Additionally Solace DAO has been funded through a seed round in 2021 (raised $1.1M). The team has displayed over time a great track-record of shipping products, developing and setting up complex architectures, operating protocols on multiple chains. Solace’s team is currently composed of 10 people: 5 engineers, 1 UI/UX designer, 2 BD & marketing, 1 operations, 1 founder (also an engineer).

# Specification

Solace is set to launch Balancer V2 fork in the most current production deployment, including all the core technology. With security in mind, Solace will not make any changes or updates (unless explicitly requested by Balancer DAO, or an emergency response to a verified vulnerability is required) to the core smart contracts. This work has been complete and the contracts are live in production. I invite you to check and verify both the application and the deployed contracts following these links:

- Website (access the app through the link on there): https://holdr.fi/
- Smart contracts: [https://holdr.gitbook.io/holdr-protocol-overview/developers/deployment-addresses](https://holdr.gitbook.io/holdr-protocol-overview/developers/deployment-addresses)

Please note that LBP UI and the Bribe market functionality are still in development, but should be completed in the following weeks, ahead of the HLDR token launch (tentatively scheduled for December'22).

Holdr will also follow the exact same governance process and tokenomics design as veBAL, locking 80/20 HLDR/wNEAR BPT with a max period of 1 year to control the HLDR liquidity mining emissions across gauges.

# HLDR Supply and Distribution

The total supply of HLDR will be 100,000,000 HLDR tokens and distributed through the following allocations and schedules:

## 5% - Balancer

A portion of the Holdr protocol should be owned by both the Balancer’s treasury and BAL holders. This would be following a standard set by a previous Balancer friendly fork, Beethoven X. We propose, in a similar fashion, that 5% of the total supply of HLDR should be allocated as follows:

- 4% provided to the Balancer DAO Treasury (2y linear vesting, 6mo cliff).
- 1% provided as an airdrop to BAL holders as follows:
    - A backdated snapshot will be taken for all BAL holders
    - Only holders with a BAL value greater than $100 USD will be eligible
    - A 2x multiplier will be assigned to BAL and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders, including the holders of veBAL locking their BPTs, on Ethereum
    - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Arbitrum BAL and BAL/ETH 60/40 BPT holders
    - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Polygon BAL, USDC/MATIC/WETH/BAL 25/25/25/25 BPT, and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders.

To achieve a more equitable distribution of the airdrop tokens, they will be distributed based on the weights above, not based on the USD value of the holdings. Note, any qualifying address will need to have a Holdr LP position, worth at least $100, staked in incentivized liquidity mining. A snapshot date will be announced within a month after the launch, if this vote is passes. The distribution mechanism of the tokens will be defined collaboratively between the Solace team and the Balancer community and the requirements outlined here are subject to small revisions.

## 15% - Solace DAO

This allocation will be awarded across Solace DAO, Solace Launch DAO, and the active team members to compensate for the on-going work and to support Holdr protocol operations. The distribution will happen on a 2 year linear vesting schedule with a 6-month cliff.

## 15% - Holdr DAO Treasury

The Holdr DAO will be formed overtime by the community and will inherit this treasury to govern and financially support any future developments, grants, contributor compensations, etc. Solace team’s goal over the next couple of years will be to pass on the governance as the Holdr DAO matures. This treasury will be be vesting linearly for 5 years, with a 1-year cliff.

## 14.125% - Ecosystem Partners & Investors

This allocations will be utilized to effectively partner with various protocols within NEAR and Aurora ecosystems, as well as to raise some capital to finance any operational costs. Vesting will follow a linear schedule of 2 years, with a 6-month cliff, similar to the Balancer DAO and Solace DAO allocation.

## 2% - HLDR Liquidity Bootstrapping

These funds will be used to seed and launch HLDR token using Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool.

## 48.875% - Liquidity Mining Emissions

Similar to Balancer’s schedule, Holdr will adopt emissions halving every 4 years. The initial emissions rate will start at 150,000 HLDR/wk.

# Friendly Fork Agreement

If accepted by the Governance process of both DAOs, this friendly fork will start effective immediately. There is no expiry date to the agreement; however, both DAOs can override this Friendly Fork agreement through their governance process to remove the Friendly Fork title with a one-month notice period. If such decision passes a vote, Balancer DAO will loose claim to all unvested HLDR tokens granted to their DAO Treasury.",bullish
390,"[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum.](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-increase-perp-captier-from-cap1-to-cap2-1m-3m/396)

Based on [updated whitelist](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this proposal is to increase PERP from cap 1 to cap 2. PERP currently has 12.8M in liquidity

**What is PERP**
Perpetual is a new project that could bring a lot of trading volume to balancer. They provide perpetual futures contracts that are based in USD. This is different to protocols such as dydx where the base token may be in ETH or a native token traded - this is a massive differentiation point given a lot of the large trading volume exchanges such as Bitmex, binance and deribit denominate in USD.

The PERP token is planned to have distributions back to token holders through a percentage of trading fees which provides a mechanism to encourage trading volume",neutral
391,"### Background:

Uniswap’s [genesis liquidity incentive program](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) ends on Nov 17. The existing program distributed 20 million UNI to LPs over 2 months, split evenly between the WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, and DAI/ETH pools. This works out to 2.5 million UNI per pool, per month.

#### Benefits of UNI distribution to LPs:

* Ongoing incentives allows UNI to be distributed to those providing value in the form of liquidity
* The incentivized pools are likely to remain the most liquid DEX pair on Ethereum, providing a venue to trade against ETH at virtually any size with zero slippage.
* Reduced incentives prevents UNI from being distributed ‘too fast’, marked by all tokens being distributed before the Foundation’s four year vesting has passed.

#### Drawbacks of UNI distribution to LPs:

* Ongoing incentives result in UNI largely being ‘farmed and dumped’ to earn yield. See ETH USD Yield Farm, Pickle, Harvest and Alpha.
* Reduced incentives means UNI is distributed slower.
* Incentivizing the same pools can be seen as choosing ‘winners’ by selecting WBTC as THE Bitcoin on Ethereum and favoring certain stablecoins over others.

### Proposed new distribution:

Distribute UNI for an additional 2 months from the time this proposal is adopted and executed by governance. Distribute to the same 4 pools, but at half the rate of the genesis distribution. This works out to 1.25 million UNI per month to each of the 4 covered pools (WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, DAI/ETH), for a total of 5M UNI per month, or 10M UNI total over the next 2 months.

Please see the liquidity incentive [governance plan document](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590) for full details and timelines.

### Temperature check question:

Should Uniswap distribute UNI to liquidity providers per the specifications outlined above?

### Next steps:

The snapshot poll will be live for 3 days. If the poll passes with a minimum of 25,000 UNI in support, this proposal will move forward to the consensus check phase. Details about the Uniswap governance process can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732).",neutral

AIP: TBD
Title: ARC - Add DPI as Collateral on the AAVE ARC market
Status: Proposal
Authors: @MatthewGraham @metfanmike @Mringz @3SEHoldings
Created: 03-02-2022

---

# Summary

This proposal aims to begin the onboarding process for listing DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) as collateral on the Aave ARC market.
# Abstract

DPI is the market leading DeFi themed indices product that presents investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to some of the largest DeFi names. The DPI token, an ERC20, is readily traded and has strong on-chain liquidity. DPI is currently supported by several large institutional investors making it readily accessible to large investors.

This proposal presents an opportunity for the Aave community to begin the onboarding process in working towards an Aave ARC listing. This will enable Aave to offer direct exposure to defi without needing to list several tokens and as we have seen from the Aave V2 Ethereum market listing there has been significant large investor demand for DPI.
# Motivation

On the 21st August 2021, Aave was the first major lending protocol to integrate an index product into its platform. The value of the DPI deposited into the Aave V2 Ethereum market quickly grew to over $60M. Furthermore, most of this $60M was supplied by a handful of addresses, which shows there is market appetite amongst investors to deposit indices like DPI on protocols like Aave ARC.

DPI is the market benchmark for DeFi and is becoming the investor grade standard for DeFi. Adding DPI would dramatically increase support to help make DeFi more readily accessible to more traditional investors via the KYC approved Aave ARC platform. Having already found strong support within the retail segment of the market with over [15,600](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1494ca1f11d487c2bbe4543e90080aeba4ba3c2b) holders. Index Coop believes listing DPI on Aave ARC as collateral with risk parameters in line with Aave V2 Ethereum market will be an ideal listing choice, offering exposure to many leading DeFi protocols through a single asset listing. Furthermore, being a basket of tokens, the volatility characteristics make DPI ideal for use as collateral.

# Rational

DPI is a basket of 13 popular DeFi tokens available on Ethereum. The methodology behind DPI is from Scalara (formally Pulse, Inc), a subsidiary of DeFi Pulse. The criteria for token selection can be found [here](https://www.scalara.xyz/). DPI is the most popular DeFi index product with ~$100m AUM and over 15,600 holders.

DPI is built on top of Set Protocol and managed by Index Coop. Index Coop is a decentralized and autonomous asset manager governed, maintained, and upgraded by INDEX token holders.

Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

DPI would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem because it allows for a large pool of dormant capital (>$100m in non incentivized DPI AUM) to find a productive use. Additionally:

* Significant Borrow Demand: There is significant desire from whales to lend out the DeFi Pulse index and to use the DPI as collateral to borrow stablecoins for farming, going leveraged long/short, and implementing structured products (e.g. carry trade).
* Low Volatility: Because indices are a basket of tokens, they represent less volatility than the component assets by themselves
* Efficient Sector Representation: Adding an index as collateral also gives exposure to all the component tokens while only having to add in a single token, thus saving gas in Aave’s system
* Liquidity via Primary and Secondary Markets: Minting and redeeming represent the primary market of the indices, but many users can buy and sell indices on the secondary markets - mostly Uniswap. The price on the secondary markets are kept at Net Asset Value (the market value of all the underlying components) through a network of market makers that redeem the tokens when price is below NAV and vice versa.

Additionally IndexCoop DAO is voting on a liquidity mining campaign to draw TVL to the Arc Market and give institutions a taste of the power of token incentives.

## DPI for Institutions

IndexCoop, the DAO issuer of DPI, has relationships with Fireblocks (a whitelister for the Aave ARC Market) as well as BitGo and Coinbase Custody to provide institutional custodial options, as well as deep liquidity through partnerships with market maker, and ARC market participant Wintermute.

Listing DPI will allow institutions to gain access to direct DeFi exposure without Aave ARC needing to list many tokens.

# Specification

DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) should be whitelisted for use on the Aave Arc Market. The address of the token on the Ethereum Main Network is 0x1494CA1F11D487c2bBe4543E90080AeBa4BA3C2b

**Protocol Description:**

Manifold Finance enables and provides access to high-value transaction pools on EVM compatible chains, through our infrastructure: *SecureRPC* . They aggregate multiple endpoints along with maintaining direct access to disparate mining pools/validator nodes (Flashbots, Eden, Miners).

**Motivation:**

Current onchain liquidity is sitting at only 300k while generating in the past few days over 4m$ in volume incentives & bribes to deepen liquidity at this stage of growth is key for Manifold.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** 

Governance utilizes an architecture of elected dictator. By staking FOLD tokens, you delegate protocol control to one address (the dictator). The dictator offers a tribute (rewards) for your support. Accounts that are participating in the dictator regime may elect to vote for a new supreme dictator (operator/management for the protocol) by removing their support and reallocating it towards a new address.  
Source : https://github.com/manifoldfinance/majordomo

A known attack vector involving sandwich staking is mitigated by manually disbursing tributes. This attack vector will be mitigated by a time-dependent withdrawal period in our V2 Vault upgrade. 

> Note that this attack vector has never been actually realized, as it was caught beforehand

Protocol Fees are immediately collected in a vault which then distributes it over time (the time withdrawal is to prevent MEV attacks against the protocol in which accounts enter/exit during certain periods of time). 

A Multisig address is available. The multisig only holds tokens for the purposes of voting in governance proposals of other DAO's. This will be migrated to a vault-based permissive action list structure in which the tokens are held in-vault, with certain permissions enabled for the operator address only. 

2. **Oracles:** 

Not Applicable. 

3. **Audits:**  

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/pki#security-bug-handling-process

https://www.manifoldfinance.com/.well-known/security.txt

Additionally they maintain the DeFi Threat Matrix which is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations on decentralized finance

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/defi-threat/security/advisories?state=published



4. **Centralization vectors:** 

They utilize a concept of Permissive Action List to enable a two-step ownership process for any partner integrations. 

Centralization risks include but are not limited to:

GitHub - we perform off site backups and coordination in the event of GitHub deleting the manifoldfinance org (see LMDBX event for an example).

Google Services: We utilize a domain name not administered by Google for internal services such as user registration, etc. This is not the manifoldfinance.com email address.

Governance Discussions occur on a centralized service, Discourse. [see forums.manifoldfinance.com](https://forums.manifoldfinance.com)

There are also certain account addresses with a large amount of FOLD tokens. However we feel that due to the 'unique' governance regime that this is not in practice a risk factor as it would normally be under traditional DAO governance structures. 

5. **Market History:** 

Pool has been activated in the past 14 days and saw over 225k volume since inception on approximately 84k$ BPT with a current APR of 256% & fees of 1200$ in the past 24h.

### [ARFC]  Risk Parameters for DAI Update

### Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

### Date: 2024-04-02

---

### **Summary**

This proposal aims to update the risk parameters for the DAI stablecoin across all Aave deployments.

## Motivation

MakerDAO's recent aggressive actions with their D3M program have resulted in a significant increase in the ""D3M"" credit line for DAI, growing from 0 to predicted 600 million DAI within less than a month. With the potential extension of this credit line to 1 billion DAI in the near term, the unpredictability of future governance decisions by MakerDAO raises concerns regarding the inherent risk nature of DAI as collateral.

These liquidity injections are done in a non-battle-tested protocol with a ""hands off"" risk management ethos and no safety module risk mitigation feature.

The Aave protocol had previous experience of the consequences of reckless minting policies at a much smaller scale, with Angle's AgEUR (now EURA) mint into EULER a week before their hack and jEUR minting into Midas leading to the asset long-term depeg.

Given that only a fraction of DAI deposits are currently utilized as collateral on Aave, and users have ample liquidity to switch to USDC or USDT as alternative collateral options, this proposal aims to mitigate potential risks without significantly negatively impacting our user base.

## Specification

### Proposed Changes:

### **Conservative**

**Decrease DAI and sDAI LTV by 12 Percentage Points, LT 1 Percentage Point Per 100M Deployed:**

Based on the details outlined in this [post](https://governance.aave.com/t/generalized-lt-ltv-reduction-on-aave/16766), there is a planned gradual reduction in the LTV ratios for DAI and sDAI on Aave V3, transitioning from 77% to 75%, accompanied by a decrease in the LT from 80% to 78% across most chains. Considering these anticipated adjustments and the maximum implied percentage of total DAI backing by (s)USDe at 12%, we conservatively recommend a linear reduction of an additional 12 percentage points in LTV. Regarding the LT, we suggest a conditional decrease of 1 percentage point for every 100M in D3M exposure, with a maximum reduction of 6 percentage points, assuming the full 600M is deployed. LT reductions naturally come with potentially induced liquidations, thus if the amount liquidated due to LT changes is deemed too large, we will modify accordingly. This process will begin with a 1% reduction from the current value to account for the initial 100M, once the initial expected decrease has been completed.

**Given current inconsistencies in DAI LTs across the different chains, we will aim to align the LTs and LTVs in the first stage of this proposal. This means that in instances where the LT is currently set higher, the initial reduction would be more than the 1% suggested above. This standardization will be carefully planned to minimize the impact of LT reductions on the likelihood of liquidations.**

### Specification

| Chain | Asset | Current Expected LTV | Recommended LTV | Current Expected LT | Recommended LT (1st stage) | Recommended LT (Last Stage) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V3 Ethereum | DAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |
| V3 Arbitrum | DAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |

| V3 Avalanche | DAI.e | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |
| V3 Metis | m.DAI | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |
| V3 Ethereum | sDAI | 75% | 63% | 78% | 77% | 72% |
| V2 Ethereum | DAI | 75% | 63% | 87% | 77% | 72% |
| V2 Polygon | DAI | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |
| V2 Avalanche | DAI | 75% | 63% | 80% | 77% | 72% |

### Aggressive

**Decrease DAI and sDAI LTV to 0%, LT 1 Percentage Point Per 50M Deployed:**

Given Maker's allocation of a significant portion of potential DAI backing to a new, riskier asset, should the community wish to take more aggressive action, we propose a temporary reduction in the LTV to 0%. Regarding the LT, our recommendation is to conditionally decrease by 1 percentage point for every 50M in D3M exposure, with a maximum reduction of 12 percentage points, assuming the full 600M is deployed. LT reductions naturally come with potentially induced liquidations, thus if the amount liquidated due to LT changes is deemed too large, we will modify accordingly. This proposal prioritizes a risk-averse strategy to hedge against potential future actions by MakerDAO, considering the minimal revenues generated from collateral usage. This process will begin with a 2% reduction from the current value to account for the initial 100M.

**Given current inconsistencies in DAI LTs across the different chains, we will aim to align the LTs and LTVs in the first stage of this proposal. This means that in instances where the LT is currently set higher, the initial reduction would be more than the 2% suggested above. This standardization will be carefully planned to minimize the impact of LT reductions on the likelihood of liquidations.**

401,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Quidd ($QUIDD) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Quidd, where users can stake $CAKE for $QUIDD tokens! Users will earn $QUIDD tokens, joining Quidd’s community of over 7 million collectors to foster a new ecosystem where creators, developers, and collectors are compensated for the value they contribute to the digital collectibles economy.


#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $QUIDD tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 129,100 QUIDD
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on November 30th 2021
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on January 29th 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.07471 QUIDD

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the QUIDD Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a QUIDD-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

#### What is QUIDD?

From the team “Quidd is a digital collectibles and NFT marketplace. For over five years, Quidd has facilitated the issuance, sale, and exchange of limited-edition, officially-licensed digital collectibles - featuring more than 325 of the world’s most popular brands, including Marvel, Disney, Game Of Thrones, Rick And Morty, the NBA, and more. 

Quidd serves over 7,000,000 mainstream digital collectors, stores over 2.1B pieces of individually-serialized digital artwork, and facilitates over 6 transactions per second in its aftermarket. 

The QUIDD token is designed to give Quidd’s collectors and creators added utility in both the Quidd app including purchasing of NFTs and collectibles, governance and trade as well as create and collect-to-earn programs utilizing the QUIDD token.”

402,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Multipliers

Firstly, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to the Trading Allocation (and therefore farms) – the per block allocation to the Trading Allocation will be unchanged at [**~2.11 CAKE/block**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics) as of proposal posting.

Importantly, the purpose of these proposals is to **redistribute** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

By redistributing farm rewards from the farms mentioned below, APRs for all other performing farms will be boosted, **enabling a more positive environment for increased trading**. 
 
This ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns, optimizing how the platform utilizes the Trading Allocation.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and optimal manner.**

💡Refresher💡: We recently streamlined our tokenomics – structuring our emissions by function, rather than product –, and Farm Rewards are part of the Trading Allocation now. Read more [**here**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x57e2865781344eb395f37e38a2c78a92ea9efc3413ef0d33438b2e331015e803).

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more capacity to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

403,"## Overview:

Scope: Reactivate all Badger Smart Contracts to enable recoverable funds to be transferred from the attackers wallets to the DAO recovered funds multi sig.

## TL;DR:

The approval of [BIP-76](https://snapshot.org/#/badgerdao.eth/proposal/0xd3360ea2f5e101b01ad3c80d04f2abeb38f8faee2ebba1ca791e8c1b360b7d7b) has allowed for the upgrading of the protocol smart contracts. BIP-77 will not be enacted until actions described in BIP-76 have completed. The next step in the process of fund recovery is the reactivation of all smart contracts to facilitate the proposed rescue.

## Approval of BIP-77 achieves the below:

- Reactivate the protocol smart contracts
- Execute the stolen funds recovery scripts
- Develop clarity on multisig permissions within the DAO (specifically, the dev multisig)

## Explanation Of Choices:

- Approve: Unpause all contracts, recover stolen funds to DAO recovered funds multisig, and give permission to multisig to unpause in the future without a BIP
- Approve Without Precedent: Unpause all contracts, recover stolen funds to DAO recovered funds multisig, but require BIPs for any future unpausing events
- Deny: Keep all contracts paused and do not recover stolen funds

405,"### Service Provider Name & Overview

 The Balancer Maxis are a passionate group of Balancer community contributors. A center of excellence that keeps the Balancer ecosystem operating at a first class level. As the protocol grows, this team's responsibilities will likely grow with it. We have picked up maintenance tasks from other organizations in the Balancer ecosystem as it continues to decentralize and would expect this to continue (see examples below).

### Leader(s)

Solarcurve - joined by Zekraken, Mike B, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, and Danko8383.

**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct (or link to your own)**: Yes

**Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines:** Yes

### Domains of Operation

*Multisig Management*

* Linear (boosted) pool settings
* Swap fee and amplification adjustments
* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL
* Adding new reward tokens to gauges
* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees
* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig

**Expertise:** Besides setting swap fees, this group has done all these tasks from day 1. Soon after we took control of swap fees from our friends at Gauntlet, the protocol broke the previous record of 24h fees earned. We believe our track record justifies our continued management of these multisigs until such time as governance approves another SP to take them over.

*Governance*

* We serve on the [Governance Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp/2324) and ensure continuity of Balancer’s Governance Process
* Active participants in discord and the forum on governance topics
* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)
* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process
* Manage admin of the Governance forum
* We will pursue various strategic initiatives, either individually or as a group, at our discretion such as deploying to Optimism or the new Operating Framework
* In the cases that voting power in other protocols from tokens held in Balancer’s Treasury has been delegated to us, we will represent Balancer’s interest in these votes.

**Expertise:** We helped to design Balancer’s governance system and are very active users of it. It is safe to say our group has the strongest working knowledge of Balancer’s governance system outside of Balancer Labs. For now it does require active management to ensure votes are carried out in an orderly fashion then properly executed. We believe our track record here again speaks for itself and we will continue to operate in the same fashion we have been until governance approves a new governance framework or approves another SP to take these tasks over.

*User/project support*

* We manage Balancer’s discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed
* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions
* We often deploy new pools for other projects
* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists
* We help with UI testing for Balancer

**Expertise:** If you come to discord we’ll likely be the ones helping you out. We are also spread out in many chats with projects offering advice and performing routine necessary tasks as described above. It is safe to say almost all projects that have used Balancer over the last year have spoken to one of us at some point. We will continue to operate in this support capacity and offer any assistance we can to the community and the efforts of other SP’s.

*Community*

* We manage a Coordinape circle open to all DAO contributors
* Onboarding framework for new contributors
* Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO, or between SPs
* Regular health-check on SP and community contributors with recurrent feedback

**Expertise:** These initiatives were pioneered by some of our members over the last six months. We will continue iterating and exploring these both with our in house knowledge but also in collaboration with the broader community.

*Record Keeping*

* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.
* Maintaining, updating, and improving official Balancer documentation as a bridge between the greater community and core development team.

### Key Objectives & Success Metrics

*Multisig Management*

* Transactions are vetted for accuracy and executed in a timely manner
* Public discord channels are used for swap fee discussion so the community can provide input and feedback.

*Governance*

* Balancer’s Governance system continues to operate in a fair and transparent manner.
* We will continue being very active participants and leaders

*User/project support*

* Discord/telegram chat questions will be answered in a timely manner

*Community*

* Coordinape will pay out promptly each month
* We will act as a touch point for any interested contributors to Balancer DAO

*Global*

* We commit to undertake all activities in public where reasonable. We aim to responsibly grow the Balancer Maxis and this can only be done when the community is able to interact and engage with us. There must be more opportunities for this in the future.
* We will continue to facilitate the weekly Treasury meeting (Tuesday 11am EST in discord) open to the public. This is a good opportunity for anyone in the community to talk to us about the Treasury or any other relevant topic.
* We will facilitate a monthly community call where all SP’s are welcome to join for their monthly updates. This eases the burden on the community to attend many calls. Again, optional participation by other SP’s.

### Length of Engagement & Budget:

3 months.

Budget of 6,875 BAL per month for salaries (1,250 per person, Danko at 625) which will be max locked in veBAL by contributors. Additional monthly allocations of 100 BAL for gas costs and 4,000 BAL for Coordinape.

**Total for 3 month engagement:** 32,925 BAL

**Impact on the Treasury**: The Treasury currently holds ~4M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis would cost less than 1% of the treasury’s BAL holdings.

**ETH Address to Receive Funds**: 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325

**Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation):** N/A

*As a final note, if this proposal passes Zen Dragon will be replacing mkflow on the Governance Council as he voluntarily steps away and into other roles in the ecosystem. We thank him for his service. The members of the council will now be Solarcurve, Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, and Zen Dragon.*",bullish
406,"#### ABSTRACT

The DAO’s operations rely on the Ape Foundation, which serves as a steward for ApeCoin by empowering the community to lead the DAO and helping to execute its vision. The terms of the Foundation’s relationship with the DAO were established on a six-month basis in AIP-1. That six-month period will conclude on September 30, and absent any alternative process for continuing the DAO’s operations, will bring with it the risk that the DAO falls into a vulnerable period during which it lacks actionable operational procedures. This AIP proposes a three-month extension of the terms laid out in AIP-1 to (1) provide time for the development of a proper and thorough Ape Foundation election framework and process; (2) allow the community to better understand and ultimately engage with whatever process emerges; and (3) enable the DAO to continue functioning coherently beyond September 30.

#### PROPOSAL

*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",bullish

TLDR; Approve 100 DIGG from the treasury for use as the redemption pool for the rebase options initiative. Amount calculated to use is 240 gDIGG (Genesis DIGG) or ~6% of the supply of DIGG. This is currently around 85 DIGG but may change if we see any rebases (at time of comment).

## Protocol Description:

Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a DAO and started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.

Inverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;

* On the supply side of money markets by Inverse Finance's “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.
* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA-3POOL through our partnership with Yearn (currently $56M TVL), or the DOLA-FRAX basepool through our partnership with Frax.
* Via purcha stablecose with DAIin using[ The Stabilizer](https://www.inverse.finance/swap/DAI/DOLA).

DOLA is not ""algorithmic"" and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.

## Motivation:

This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the DOLA/bb-f-usd 50/50 stable pool. Inverse recently successfully obtained a veBAL gauge for the [INV/DOLA](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x0678e2094fa6b3adf61e319c3000b6080f84d43d7555552510dfd2949fa8c4c0) 50-50 pool on Balancer and this proposal aims to build on this momentum. Platform BAL incentives would help deepen DOLA liquidity as we seek to further alleviate our dependence on the Curve ecosystem for DOLA liquidity. The [DOLA-3CRV](https://curve.fi/factory/27) gauge on Curve currently has over $56MTVL ($108M ATH) and Inverse recently obtained gauge approval for a [DOLA-FraxBP](https://curve.fi/factory/176); we have provided around $1mm USD value in bribe incentives to drive liquidity into these pool. If approved, we expect to do the same for our veBAL gauge and are in coordination with Hidden Hand to facilitate the incentivization and drive the Balancer bribe market narrative.

The Inverse Finance Team aims to be a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions utilizing Redacted Cartel’s Hidden Hand (“HH”) platform to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Once the 50/50 DOLA/bb-f-usd stable pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer.

## Specifications:

You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.

**Governance:**

Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to the [DOLA-3CRV](https://curve.fi/factory/27) and [DOLA-FraxBP](https://curve.fi/factory/176) Curve pools as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.

**Oracles:**

A custom INV oracle with both a price ceiling and borrow cap feature has been in use following a price manipulation[ incident on April 2nd](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/our-plan-making-good). This oracle has been reviewed by Peckshield and is actively managed by Inverse’s Risk team.

Inverse Finance’s new lending market is due to release later this year after audits and will use ChainLink price oracles. Inverse Finance's old lending market relied on both ChainLink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable.

**Audits:**

Inverse DAO has recently established a working relationship with [Peckshield](https://peckshield.com/), and boutique security firm [Defimoon](https://defimoon.org/). A first round audit of a recent product was produced ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWNG08mib2GcI1WqnMt5IdFoW73QU2F8/view?usp=sharing)), and an audit of relevant legacy code is in progress. The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. A recent announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).

**Centralization vectors:**

Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:

* Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.
* Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.
* Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 9 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.
* Fed Chair: 2 of 5 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts.

Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).

DOLA stablecoin is fully decentralized, with no possibility to pause or blacklist any addresses, even if INV governance wanted to do so.

**Market History:**

Inverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the “Feds”, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLA’s Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. We now expect to have further resilience through the deepening of our [DOLA-FraxBP](https://curve.fi/factory/176) and our [INV-DOLA](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x441b8a1980f2f2e43a9397099d15cc2fe6d3625000020000000000000000035f) bal LP. Please see our graph below of DOLA’s peg YTD.

411,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Bomb Crypto (BCOIN) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Bomb Crypto! Bomb Crypto is a play-to-earn (P2E) game where players manage a group of NFT heroes. Players can collect heroes and items, fight monsters and trade heroes for BCOIN rewards.There are 3 ways to collect heroes: via rescue missions, buying in the shop or through auctions in the marketplace.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn BCOIN tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 258,000 BCOIN
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on January 12th 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on March 13th 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.1493 BCOIN

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap at the start is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the BCOIN Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a BCOIN-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

#### What is BCOIN?

From the team: 
“Bomb Crypto is a play-to-earn (P2E) game where players manage a group of NFT heroes. Players can collect heroes and items, fight monsters and trade heroes for BCOIN rewards.

BCOIN is the native utility token of Bomb Crypto’s gaming ecosystem, which allows holders to take part and progress quickly in Bomb Crypto’s games. BCOIN tokens can be used to upgrade heroes, open heroes boxes, charge heroes’ energy quickly, and buy tickets to events like battle royale.”

**Summary:**
> This pool will be replacing the previous wstETH/rETH gauge as we'll be deploying a different type of TWAMM pool that's better suited for the type of asset pair, see previous post: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-265-enable-wsteth-reth-gauge-ethereum/4643.
>
> We'd like to request governance to disable the old pool gauge. No liquidity has been added and we have paused the pool so no liquidity can be added or trades can happen.
>
> We'd like to request a gauge for the new pool. We have launched a brand new Balancer pool type: TWAMM. This will be a cornerstone in Balancer’s vision of the go-to AMM for DeFi protocols to build and trade upon. TWAMMs are extremely capital efficient and are critical to improve the blockchain’s anti-fragility by facilitating large asset swaps completely on-chain, see asset monetary policy, whale liquidations, treasury management, index fund re-balancing, etc.

   * Both tokens are wrapped staked ETH.
6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)
   * No, the pool would need roughly $100 - 200k in liquidity to begin with. TWAMMs are extremely capital efficient because they split the trade across thousands of blocks and dedicated arbitrageurs are constantly replenishing the capital when they correct asset price deviations.
   * Nouns DAO is interested in diversifying their treasury of stETH to rETH, roughly $28M at current prices - [wallet ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10). This will be an extremely important trade to prove the concept of our protocol and make Balancer the go-to venue for treasury diversification needs.
   * Once TWAMMs become the de-facto solution for large asset swaps, we believe Balancer protocol will become the schelling point for protocols interested in advanced trade execution.",neutral
413,"## Proposal Summary

Following Uniswap’s successful deployment on the Scroll testnet, the Scroll team is proposing that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll's upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official deployment.

Point of Contact: [ Lea Schmitt, E-mail: lea@scroll.io]

## Overview of our Proposal

We propose that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll's upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official, canonical deployment. Uniswap V3 has already been deployed to Scroll’s testnet, and the Uniswap router has processed over 1.8M transactions there.

* Scroll is a bytecode equivalent zk-rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum.
* Scroll is an open-source project developed in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation Privacy and Scaling Explorations organization. It was built with the community, for the community.
* Our community ethos and vision are aligned with Ethereum. We are committed to a secure, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and efficient future that Ethereum offers through our plans to decentralize Scroll sequencers and provers.

We propose that Uniswap will showcase this by integrating Scroll into its user interface.

## Motivation

Uniswap being deployed on multiple Ethereum L2s is integral for encouraging competition and diversity of technical solutions to scale Ethereum. We believe that Uniswap's community and the ecosystem that Scroll strives for are closely aligned. Both projects are building trustless, decentralized, and secure financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone, regardless of merit or location. Deploying to Scroll offers many benefits, including significant user savings, an expanded user base, capturing the zkEVM market, and fostering L2 native innovation.

* This deployment positions Uniswap as an early mover and captures a rapidly growing market as the Ethereum ecosystem gradually shifts to zkEVMs.

* Uniswap on Scroll will integrate closely with Scroll's rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to deploying on our mainnet, and many are deployed on our testnet: AAVE, Lens, the Graph, Covalent, Safe, and Etherscan to name a few. Given the excitement around Scroll and current usage of our testnet, we expect hundreds of projects to deploy on our mainnet post-launch.

* Importantly, Uniswap on Scroll will propel L2 DEX innovation. We are on the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum L1. Scroll will bring new developers and ecosystem integrations to Uniswap.

## Success Criteria

Deployment of Uniswap on Scroll will:
* Increase Uniswap TVL, targeting $100M within two months of deployment Grow * Uniswap order volume
* Enable listing of new assets on Uniswap that are unique to Scroll

Moreover, Scroll will bring its dedicated and expanding developer community to Uniswap, thereby boosting the growth of Uniswap's developer community.

The best way to measure success for Uniswap on Scroll is to focus on TVL and transaction volumes. We think that Scroll can deliver an additional $100M of TVL to Uniswap within two months of launch.

## Protocol Security

ZK-Rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography rather than unreliable crypto-economics.

Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 canonical bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the roll-up mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than relayer-based bridges.

Security is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM, which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we are working with two external auditing companies to audit our bridge code, and we have an in-house security team that continuously reviews our codebase. 

We plan to launch with a timelock delay and a security council to control privileged functions and contract upgrades. Finally, shortly after launch, we will introduce distributed sequencer operators.

## Deployment

After the Temperature Check, we will move forward with deploying Uniswap V3 on our Scroll mainnet, following which we will submit the Governance Proposal with the addition of the deployed contract addresses. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is effortless to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take a few hours.

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the following Uniswap v3 contracts [to be filled in after deployment] to be deemed as the canonical Uniswap deployment on Scroll. This deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to reference the Uniswap v3 Factory contract on Scroll following the process outlined here: [Post-BSL Cross-chain Deployment Process & New Uniswap.eth Subdomain](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20878).

Building a world class, low-fee marketplace for apes, by apes, powered by ApeCoin and run on the ApeCoin.com 51 domain:

Magic Eden’s vision is to build the ApeCoinDAO marketplace, the home for $APE holders to buy and sell ApeCoinDAO NFTs, including but not limited to BAYC, MAYC and BAKC, as well as Otherside Otherdeeds. All inside of the DAO’s native home at a 0.75% transaction fee and no cost to the DAO. The marketplace strives to be the place where ApeCoinDAO members can share experiences and utility across the most powerful community in NFTs. Features include: combo ETH / APE bidding, discounts for APE payments, merch functionality, and custom engineering & marketing resources. Subject to approval of this AIP, future AIPs may propose a fee split between Magic Eden and ApeCoinDAO to create a revenue stream for the community as well as Launchpad capabilities, positioning the marketplace as a platform for DAO members to launch their own projects.

title: [ARFC] Safety Module - Polygon & Avalanche Coverage Update
author: @TokenLogic
created: 2023-09-03

---

# Summary

This publication proposes updating the Safety Module (SM) coverage across the various iterations of Aave Protocol on Polygon and Avalanche networks.

SM coverage is to be removed from Polygon v2 and Avalanche v2 deployments and extended to Avalanche v3.

# Motivation

With the continued migration of users from v2 to v3, this publication seeks to further encourage users to migrate by removing the SM coverage for Aave v2 deployments on the Polygon and Avalanche networks.

During 2023, the total market size on Avalanche and Polygon Aave v2 Protocol deployments has been trending lower. At the time of writing the total market size of Aave v2 on Avalanche and Polygon is $36.2M and $134.7M respectively. For comparison, the Aave v3 deployment on each network is $199.8M and $229.9M respectively. 

By removing SM coverage for Avalanche and Polygon v2 deployments, Aave DAO will no longer be providing coverage for the outdated iterations of Aave Protocol with exception of the Aave ARC deployment. By removing the SM coverage, users are further encouraged to migrate to v3.

The Polygon Aave v3 deployment is already covered by the SM whilst the Avalanche v3 deployment is not cover by the SM. This publication seeks to extend the SM coverage to include Avalanche v3. Therefore both v3 iterations are covered by the SM and v2 iterations are not covered on Polygon and Avalanche. 

For reference, at the time of writing, the following Aave Protocol deployments are covered by the SM:

* Ethereum v2
* [Ethereum v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2cbfeb5c5329c4d1720dbae4045386fceb2d2a9bd5b42a81cee47ea5c934f491)
* [Polygon v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7da4985b2d5b1cbe6bbc0992d5c86030cedef2013487e4b53b4244c315c90155)
* [Avalanche v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreiba2pdfwoesezgpedf37bjfgadxmaigavoulek5wayqb7f2tz6byy)
* [Aave ARC](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreieeyh6pbqwhgryo6v67oxlmnfhaptrgkc3u7y6bvz2y3jdkxgrrh4)

# Specification

It is important to note based upon the current implementation of the SM, an adhoc AIP is required to implement a Shortfall Event.

The following Snapshot votes will be created to enable granular voting:

* Extend SM Coverage to Avalanche v3
* Remove SM Coverage for Polygon v2
* Remove SM Coverage for Avalanche v2

Upon conclusion of the Snapshot vote, if approved, SM coverage will be removed/extended to the respective market.

There is no need for an AIP to implement this upgrade.

**Summary**
The ether.fi team proposes a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a weETH-rETH pool on Arbitrum, with a 10% emissions cap. This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair. 

**References/Useful links:**

```
• Website - https://www.ether.fi/
• Documentation - https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/ether.fi-whitepaper
• Github Page - https://github.com/etherfi-protocol
• Discord - https://discord.com/invite/zqGzcuQWvD
• Twitter - https://twitter.com/ether_fi
```

**Protocol Description:**

ether.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.

ETH staked through the ether.fi liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on ether.fi automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols. 

The eETH contract has been live since June 2023, with eETH launching to the open market on November 15th, 2023, and has approx. 515k ETH held within it. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.

Through these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.

**Motivation:**

ether.fi is looking to seed a weETH/rETH pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for weETH on Arbitrum. Incentivising a Balancer pool will continue to boost the liquidity of the LRT on Arbitrum. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the L2 DeFi ecosystem. 

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** - Currently, the protocol utilises a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed ether.fi executives. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token.

2. **Oracles:** - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the ether.fi team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however as the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee.

* The exchange rate feed for weETH-ETH on Arbitrum has been deployed by Chainlink. 

3. **Audits:** - Audit reports for the ether.fi protocol are found on the GitBook page - [Audits - ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits). The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.

4. **Centralization vectors:** - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team at ether.fi, however this will be upgraded with the implementation of the ether.fi DAO and governance.

5. **Market History:** - eETH was first deployed November 15, 2023. Market history and protocol information can be found here on the ether.fi Dune dashboard - https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi

6. **Value:** - The weETH/rETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum. The pairing of eETH with rETH will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers.

**Title:** [ARFC] Set Liquidity Observation Labs as Emission manager for wstETH on Scroll
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-03-02

---

## **Summary**

This ARFC proposes to set Liquidity Observation Labs wallet as the emission manager for the wstETH token on Scroll. This will enable Liquidity Observation Labs to define and fund incentive programs for all wstETH markets, including Scroll, promoting growth and expanding the user base of Aave.

## Motivation

Governance have already approved setting Liquidity Observation Labs as Emission manager for wstETH on the current Aave V3 Markets. 

But since Scroll market is live, the current ARFC is set to establish Liquidity Observation Labs as Emission manager for wstETH, aligning with the desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3. 

By setting their wallet as the emission manager for the wstETH token, the Foundation will be able to directly fund incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets.

## Specification

The Liquidity Observation Labs wallet address is:

Emission Admin Wallet (Liquidity Observation Labs): [0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022)

The AIP call setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract.

`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(wstETH,[0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022],EMISSION_ADMIN);`

This method will set the Liquidity Observation Labs wallet as the emission admin for the wstETH token on Scroll, besides the current Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and Gnosis V3 markets.

## Disclaimer

This proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative has not been paid by Liquidity Observation Labs or any third party for this proposal.

## Next Steps

1. Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.
2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage

@fig – Flipside Crypto & @DAOstrat.C - Consensys / Linea

Date: 06-23-2023

Contact:

Governance@Consensys.net

-----

## Simple Summary

This Temperature Check seeks the community’s input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Linea Testnet and move to Mainnet right after all pre-conditions and dependencies are met on Linea Mainnet. Linea seeks to support Aave’s multichain future while establishing Aave as a leading market on a promising zkEVM with a robust distribution network.

## Background

### About Linea

Linea is a scalable L2 on top of Ethereum powered by a zkEVM tech stack incubated by Consensys, resulting from over 20 months of R&D from Consensys's research team. This team has a track record of successful projects in the zk space, including the GNARK library and active involvement in the Merge. Moreover, Linea is well-connected with developers in the broader ecosystem through existing relationships with MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle. The tech stack that powers Linea aims to support a wide ecosystem extending Ethereum Mainnet capabilities. It intends to align its onboarding and distribution with these products to serve developers, protocols, and builders better.

Linea aims to become a Type 2 zkEVM and achieve EVM-equivalence, processing native EVM bytecode for proving and verification. This approach allows for the execution of Solidity smart contracts without needing modifications or re-audit and compatibility at the RPC level with widely adopted middleware and toolsets, providing developers with a familiar environment to build using well-established tools and infrastructure. Linea’s technical value proposition includes the following:

1. ***EVM Equivalence*** - The network avoids transpilers or custom compilers on bytecode, meaning the Ethereum L1 solidity code requires no modification. This significantly reduces deployment costs (no need to re-audit the code) and the risk of bugs and hacks by taking the compiled bytecode directly from Solidity.

2. ***Commitment to Decentralization*** - The Linea team has publicly discussed their intent to decentralize the network within the first 12 months of operation. This includes a state-of-the-art decentralized prover and sequencer structure. Research into these topics is currently underway at Consensys.

3. ***Continual strive for innovation*** - Our priority is pushing the boundaries of the Web3 space while maintaining the highest security and full EVM compatibility. Notably, Linea fully supports EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction), and, in collaboration with key stakeholders, the network already utilizes a single-entry-point contract and hosts top-tier bundlers and paymasters services. Much effort will also be provided to foster human-driven activity by incentivizing projects that leverage attestations and identity ownership.

Linea’s testnet has handled over 2 million transactions under private beta and over 33 million transactions under public beta. Many of these transactions are users of the ongoing Voyage quest, a crucial initiative designed to help stress-test the network. The network has also shown unprecedented developer activity, with over 4.3 M unique addresses that have deployed more than 1.8M contracts, showcasing a vibrant and engaged developer community.

More than 100 global partners and protocols are committed to launching on Linea mainnet.

### Vortex - Lattice-Based SNARKs

Linea's exciting feature is its ability to consolidate transactions and submit proofs to the Ethereum main net using a novel prover mechanism with impressive performance and efficiency. This process increases throughput and reduces transaction fees while maintaining the inherent security of the Ethereum network.

Vortex, a cryptographic primitive developed at Consensys, is designed to boost Linea's performance. It employs a new type of zkProof known as a recursive aggregation proof based on Ring-SIS, a fundamental concept in lattice-based cryptography. This proofing system enables transaction batching, which enhances the network's throughput and reduces fees. Linea also uses zk circuits for computations, which aids in secure and efficient calculations.

## Motivation

### Market Adoption

Linea allows Aave to leverage the Consensys product suite distribution instantly. Linea prioritizes User Experience (UX), aiming to eliminate barriers for MetaMask's impressive community of 30M MAUs. By securing native support in the default MetaMask network dropdown list, Linea enhances user convenience and fully supports all MetaMask curated experiences. These include On/Off Ramp, MetaBridge, MetaMask Swaps, the Portfolio dApp, and the MetaMask SDK, presenting numerous opportunities for incorporating the Aave protocol.

![|567.7854671280277x358.33572179744243](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZXbCk4Wp55U6KmwfWtLo0c-s_TYgR7N2fGQeNGYFUGGS10dJcExeO4J1yi4y7nl5bs3ihs0GxXnMzNEg7FknnQvdsuS0e2iV6LuVu4hU0o1uiVAv8PA6Jzs-INGplFb98wUvxKCILlEZmBRsTQuP7JE)

The symbiotic relationship between Linea and Consensys products, specifically MetaMask, presents clear benefits. MetaMask is pivotal to bootstrapping Linea's activity through simple onboarding, while Linea plays a significant role in supporting MetaMask's future evolution.

### Key Aave Benefits

Some key benefits to Aave regarding the testnet and mainnet deployments include:

1. **Establishment of Aave markets and $GHO on Linea** - Linea's integration with the ConsenSys product suite provides Aave access to a vast and well-established user base that will facilitate distribution and onboarding for the Linea network. This enables smoother distribution and adoption of Aave markets and $GHO. The strategic alignment bolsters Aave's market reach and stimulates fresh opportunities for user engagement, ultimately contributing to Aave's growth and visibility.

2. **Being a Linea Launch Partner** - Consensys is organizing a significant promotion for the Linea mainnet expected in July. This includes marketing initiatives, partner highlights, IRL, and online presence. Aave benefits from these efforts through its testnet deployment and subsequent mainnet approval.

### Aave <> Linea Values Alignment

AAVE and Linea are committed to advancing decentralized systems and fostering innovation in the DeFi space. Both products prioritize growth and development of next-generation applications, with AAVE encouraging innovation in DeFi, and Linea enabling developers and enterprises worldwide to build modern financial infrastructure. Moreover, AAVE's focus on community engagement and investment in startups that add value to the ecosystem echoes Linea and ConsenSys' mission to serve millions of users and support a robust developer community.

### Existing Collaboration Efforts

The Linea Team successfully conducted a ""First Class Linea Citizen"" campaign, seamlessly incorporating sybil protection into quest activities. This initiative resulted from a collaborative effort between Linea, Aave, and the Lens team to integrate the Lens tech stack into the Linea network.

Creating Lineaster (Lens stack) on the testnet yielded impressive results, with over 257K Lens handles established, accompanied by more than 192K posts, 130K follow actions, and 10K comments. While not directly related to Aave, these results showcase the successful collaborative efforts between Aave-related entities and the Linea team.

### Bridge Security

The Linea team operates and maintains a canonical Open Messaging Service (OMS), allowing messages to pass to and from Ethereum & Linea. The Ethereum network verifies smart contracts on the L1 that enforce a valid state on Linea. The canonical OMS leverages our zk prover to maintain verifiability.

Moreover, the design implements a trustless relayer and leverages the rollup to maintain state/security. There are plans to secure the bridge (relayer) through decentralization; however, the priority remains on decentralizing the prover and sequencer.

For a technical walk-through of the cross-chain messaging functionality, please see [Linea Documentation](https://docs.linea.build/developers/use-message-bridge#l1-to-l2).

## Specification [Technical Considerations]

This proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Linea testnet before its mainnet launch.

**Oracles** - While the network is not currently integrated with Chainlink, the integration is expected to be completed shortly after the mainnet. In the meantime, for the testnet phase, Linea will collaborate with Aave to find suitable alternatives. It's important to note that Linea already operates with several Oracle providers, including Redstone and Umbrella.

**Implementation** - The authors of this proposal are committed to working closely with the relevant parties to determine the most suitable asset and market factors for the mainnet proposal. Given that this pertains to a testnet deployment, the asset and market factors will be managed directly through Linea, ensuring an organized and effective execution.

**Governance** - This proposal represents a collaborative effort between the Aave community (specifically Flipside) and Consensys/Linea. This proposal was not sponsored in any way. This ensures transparent, fair, and comprehensive governance procedures that align with the interests of all involved parties.

## Disclaimer

Linea nor Consensys has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and Flipside is doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.

All information provided above is from public sources or from the Linea team directly.

This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.

## Next Steps

Following a standard 7-day discussion period, Flipside will work with the community to trigger a Snapshot for a vote for testnet deployment. The Linea team will handle all technical deployment activities. Linea will also engage with necessary parties to complete all required work.

From here, we will openly communicate progress with the community and the intended progression when all technical dependencies are met. These activities ensure that Aave can be a Linea launch partner in July.",neutral

#### PancakeSwap and Token Supply

The state of DeFi and PancakeSwap has changed immensely since our inception in September 2020, and we propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750,000,000 (750M) to better reflect our long-term outlook on PancakeSwap and the $CAKE token.

#### Current PancakeSwap Tokenomics

In the kitchen, we have been working hard to bring value to PancakeSwap and the $CAKE token, from providing new products (e.g. Perpetuals), to sourcing the tastiest Syrup Pools and Farms. Unique amongst AMMs, we also burn transaction fees from platform activities (e.g. trading, prediction, farm auctions) to further increase the scarcity of the $CAKE token.

**But we can do better, and we will.**

#### Proposed Cap on CAKE Maximum Token Supply

We propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M $CAKE. Based on our calculations – which can be found in detail in our [**litepaper v2**](https://v2litepaper.pancakeswap.finance/) – this comfortably gives us an approximate runway of 3 years, before the current circulating supply reaches this cap. 

We believe that implementing this proposed cap will enable the $CAKE token to better reflect the value, community, and sustainability of PancakeSwap.

#### What’s next?

If the community decides to approve the proposal to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M, we will formally incorporate it into our tokenomics, and institute the max token supply cap.

## Summary

LongHash Ventures proposes a program for BAL/WETH LP token (“BPT” throughout this proposal) holders to stake their BPT for different periods of time in order to get economic benefits, such as boosting their Liquidity Mining rewards, and governance benefits, such as having the ability to vote on proposals. This staking feature is beneficial for the Balancer protocol as it rewards BAL holders who take a long-term view through staking of their BPT, while still ensuring BAL is not sitting idly staked but within a BAL pool.

For the purpose of focusing on the staking and governance mechanisms, this document will only propose staking of BPT from the BAL/WETH pool. In the future, proposals can be made to include BPTs from other BAL pools. Additionally, this proposal will only propose staking on L1. Staking on L2s such as Polygon should be addressed in a separate proposal.

## Background

LongHash Ventures is a Web 3 investment fund and accelerator actively collaborating with founders to navigate the crypto landscape in Asia and build their Web 3 model. In January 2021, we launched a DeFi-focused fund and invested in projects such as Balancer. We also invited Balancer to join our Asia DeFi Network initiative, as part of which we worked together with Balancer Labs over the course of 12 weeks through our venture building program to support them with the development of a decentralized governance model, liquidity mining for Balancer V2, and community building in China. We wrote this proposal as a follow on to the work we did on governance as a natural first step and enabler towards a decentralized governance model.

Governance token staking has been adopted by DeFi protocols, such as Uniswap and Curve. It is a way to provide an incentive mechanism for token holders to actively participate in the governance of the protocol. It is also beneficial for the protocol as it rewards BAL holders that take a long-term view, and incentivizes them to actively participate in the governance and future development of the protocol.

As the governance of Balancer begins to shift from Balancer Labs to a more decentralized model that is led by the community, staking of BPT from the BAL/WETH pool can act as a mechanism to incentivize token holders to actively participate in the governance of the protocol.

We have taken inspiration from the staking model of Curve, Idle Finance, and Pickle Finance for this proposal.

## Proposal

We propose a staking program and mechanism for the BPT of the BAL/WETH pool to have economic and governance benefits, as part of a broader effort to formalize the decentralized governance framework that will govern the Balancer protocol.

## Economic benefits of staking BPT

### Boosting of BAL rewards for Liquidity Mining

In Balancer V2, Liquidity Providers can earn BAL tokens from the liquidity provided into specific pools eligible, based on their proportional share of liquidity of those pools.

Liquidity Providers could stake BPT from the BAL/WETH pool to boost their Liquidity Mining rewards, based on the period of time the tokens are staked for. For example, Liquidity Mining rewards could be boosted by X (multiplier) if BPT tokens are staked for Y (time period). Note that this staking mechanism does not change or impact the amount of weekly BAL allocated to the pool, but rather changes the proportion of the allocation of those BAL rewards to the LPs depending on their share of the pool and whether they have staked their BPT and the duration of staking.

## Governance benefits of staking BPT

### Voting on proposals

As Balancer embarks on a journey towards decentralization of how the protocol is run, a key enabler of this will be for the ability of BPT holders to vote on proposals. Staking of BPT would allow addresses that staked to vote on Balancer protocol governance proposals as long as the BPT remains staked/locked.

## Features of BPT staking

BPT token holders would have the option to stake their BPT into a smart contract and lock it in for a period of between 1 month and up to 4 years, in monthly increments, e.g. 1 month, 2 months, …, and 48 months. The UI/UX would be intuitive for less experienced users, for example with a “slider” feature with monthly increments, from 1 month to 48 months, that can also show the LP what the rewards booster is for each lock up period.

In return, BPT token holders who stake their BPT receive vBPT, a token that enables them to claim economic and governance benefits outlined above. Those who stake BPT would receive vBPT on a 1:1 basis regardless of the locking period. The boost to liquidity mining rewards depending on the locking period is outlined in the table below: SEE FORUM POST

Note that BPT holders who stake their BPT will not be able to withdraw BAL from the BAL/WETH pool for the staking period of BPT, e.g. if a BPT holder stakes BPT for 12 months, they will not be able to withdraw BAL or WETH from the BAL/WETH pool for 12 months.

The formula for rewards boosting would work, conceptually, as follows:

[LP’s share of pool] x [Multiplier] / [Sumproduct of LP’s share of pool and multiplier] = [Share of BAL rewards]

## Conclusion

This proposal for a staking mechanism to give economic and governance benefits to BAL holders can be a benefit for Balancer on two fronts:

-It provides a rewards mechanism for BAL holders who take the long-term view
-It is a starting point for Balancer to shift to a decentralized governance model

We think it is best to start with the features outlined above for the staking mechanism. In the future, additional features or modifications / scope can be proposed and added to it, such as:

-Staking BPT from BAL pools other than BAL/WETH
-Distribution of protocol fees to vBPT holders
-Vote boosting feature to provide additional voting power to BPT holders who stake for longer periods of time
-Staking mechanism for L2s",bearish

## Title : [ARFC] wGHO Aave V3 Onboarding

## Author : Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs

## Date: 2023-08-09
---
## Summary

This proposal aims to onboard wGHO, an ERC-20 token wrapper of GHO, as a collateral-only asset in a newly created stablecoin emode within the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.

## Motivation

The onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.

This integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.

Alongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.

It's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.

wGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. 

## Specification

The ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:

- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset, isolation mode, and emode focus asset.
- wGHO parameters:

| LTV | 77% |
| --- | --- |
| LT | 80%  |
| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |
| Supply Cap | 10M |
| Borrow Cap | 0 |
| Debt Ceiling | 10M$ |
- Create a dedicated stablecoin emode on Aave V3 ETH pool for wGHO, USDC, USDT, DAI, LUSD
- Emode stablecoin category parameters:

| LTV | 87.5% |
| --- | --- |
| LT | 90% |
| Liquidation penalty | 1% |

### Note:

wGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.

Onboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.

## Disclaimer

The Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The he author have both large GHO debt & GHO holdings. The ACI uses GHO to fund the [Orbit program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241).

433,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes XCAD Network ($XCAD) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new **90 days** Syrup Pool with XCAD Network! 

XCAD Network is a content creator tokenization platform where users can earn and trade their favourite creators' tokens.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn XCAD tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 285,800 XCAD
 - **Distribution duration:** 90 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 9 Nov 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 7 Feb 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.1102 XCAD

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the XCAD Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing an XCAD-CAKE farm.  


The farm will have 0.5x CAKE rewards for the first 7 days, then 0.2x rewards after that. At the end of the 90-day period – approx. 1100 UTC on 7 Feb 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0.1x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.2x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $XCAD?

From the team: “The use cases of XCAD are as follows:

- Govern creator’s decisions via a plugin which works directly on YouTube
- Stake to get access to Creator Liquidity Offering (CLO) - Launchpad for creators
- Stake to earn fan tokens on the Google Chrome Plug-in”

435,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal outlines the creation of a comprehensive and user-friendly newsletter for the ApeCoin DAO community. The newsletter aims to offer concise summaries of new proposals, initiating informed discussions and enabling every member to contribute actively to the platform’s evolution. This isn’t just about sharing information - it’s about inspiring understanding and fostering a more unified and democratically engaged DAO community.

#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

Investing in this initiative equates to investing in a passionate builder from within our community, committed to over-delivering on the promise of fostering a more informed, engaged, and vibrant ApeCoin ecosystem.

But What unique value will the Proposal Summaries Newsletter bring to the ApeCoin ecosystem as a whole?

1. **Increased Accessibility and Understanding:** The newsletter aims to translate complex AIPs into simple, digestible language, breaking down technical barriers and easing time constraints that often limit wider participation. Every member, regardless of their technical acumen or time commitments, deserves to understand, discuss, and vote on proposals that shape our DAO.

2. **Enhanced Community Engagement:** A regular, concise, and easy-to-understand newsletter, delivered directly to ApeCoin members, facilitates ongoing engagement with the DAO's activities. This increased engagement strengthens the democratic process and cultivates a more connected and vibrant community.

3. **Promoting Informed Decision-making:** The ApeCoin DAO operates on democratic principles, and well-informed participants are crucial for a functioning democracy. By providing unbiased, neutral summaries of AIPs, we enable members to cast their votes based on understanding and facts, not speculation.

4. **Community Building:** A consistent, reliable line of communication nurtures stronger ties within our DAO community. This sense of unity and belonging encourages more members to actively participate and contribute to our collective goals.

5. **Supporting AIP Authors:** AIP authors also benefit from this initiative. Our summaries make their ideas accessible to a wider audience in an easily comprehensible format, leading to broader discussions, constructive feedback, and ultimately, more robust AIPs.
#### OVERALL COST

To materialize this initiative, a robust financial plan has been carved out. Encompassing the various phases of the project, the financial blueprint divides the costs into initial setup and weekly operations.

The project kicks off with an initial investment of 1,200 $APE. This infusion is primarily directed towards a diverse set of tasks that lay the groundwork for the initiative. From setting up the Beehiiv platform, website designing, and development to kick-starting the first round of in-depth research, content creation, and formatting, this phase also involves initial promotion and distribution of the newsletter. Moreover, the cost also takes into account the graphic design aspect, making the content visually appealing and easier to digest.

Following the setup phase, the project enters the operational stage. Here, the weekly recurring cost is 1,050 $APE, accounting for tasks including continued research, content writing, designing, editing, and distributing the newsletters.

The cost that will be received within the year (52 weeks) of weekly recurring payments
55,800 $APE as a total amount.

We aim to build an independent website besides the Beehiiv platform. This would provide a unique, user-friendly experience, fostering a deeper connection between the ApeCoin DAO community and the newsletter.

**Summary:**
[Overnight.fi ](http://overnight.fi/) is an asset management protocol specializing in delta-neutral strategies. Overnight’s core product is USD+, a 100% collaterized yield-bearing stablecoin. The collateral of USD+ consists of yield-generating DeFi strategies, including lending to Aave, stable-to-stable and delta-neutral strategies.

Overnight Steady Accord is the new implementation of Overnight Pulse, a boosted USDC-DAI pool that relies on USD+ for yield. In March 2023, following a positive vote on [BIP-208] [[BIP-208] Enable Overnight Pulse Gauge [Optimism] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-208-enable-overnight-pulse-gauge-arbitrum/4463) Overnight Pulse was entered as a core pool, a gauge for Overnight Pulse pool on Optimism had been enabled. This is the request to re-enable the gauge, following the changes to its code-base.

Overnight Pulse has a successful history of driving volumes and TVL to Balancer’s ecosystem. Overnight pulse on Optimism, implemented via [Beets.fi](http://beets.fi/), reached 7M TVL and generated daily trading volumes in the range of 300-500K, peaking at 3.21M USD. The yield was consistently in the range of 12-14% APR, of which just 2-3% came from rewards, with the rest generated by USD+.

Following the entry by Aura and implementation of cross-chain gauges, the bribing economics on Beets OP has improved to a point where we expect it to be attractive to incentivize USD+ liquidity via bribing. Overnight has consistently been the top briber on various Solidly forks on Arbitrum, OP, BNB and zkSync. We now look to repeat the same approach on a more sustainable ve3,3 platform - Balancer/Aura. We are proposing the pool to enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19. This means protocol fees earned by this pool and a portion of the yield would be used to bribe for votes on it. Consequently, this pool will also receive bribes from those fees in proportion to this pool’s TVL relative to other Beets core pool TVL

**Protocol Description:**

[Overnight.fi ](http://overnight.fi/) is an asset management protocol specializing in delta-neutral strategies. Overnight’s core product is USD+, a 100% collaterized yield-bearing stablecoin. The collateral of USD+ consists of yield-generating DeFi strategies, including lending to Aave, stable-to-stable and delta-neutral strategies.

**Motivation:**

Balancer and Beets have clearly been pursuing yield bearing liquidity for quite some time. Overnight Pulse has attracted both strong TVL and stablecoin trading volumes on Beethoven OP, Overnight has attracted up to 30M TVL on Arbitrum, in particular, via Chronos and Ramses Solidly implementations. With Aura’s entry to OP, the opportunity presents itself for Balancer to become an Overnight’s core liquidity platform on Optimism. This is net positive for the protocol.

> Explain why this pool needs incentivization

The boost generated by USD+ is attractive enough for the pool’s TVL to be sustainable. Incentives are required for the pool to grow to a level where USD+ yield represents the majority of the pool’s APR. Incentives received by Overnight as part of OP grant would be used partially to boostrap the pool, by bribing via Aura

On April 18th the funding of the Balancer DAO for Q2 was ratified [[1](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xe05bc1a898797cd8f78f86bed25bac84efade2df1a959daee09f8dd7c69d3b36)]. As part of the proposal 21,250 BAL and $127,500 USDC was requested for contributor compensation. With the recent market downturn the ops multisig does not have sufficient BAL to pay the expected June Balaries (See here how discounted veBAL compensation is calculated [[2](https://balancergrants.notion.site/Compensation-cb303e0241d94d96bed110929947029d)] ). The proposal is to:

* ops subDAO Multisig [[3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325#tokentxns)] swaps its remaining USDC (expected to be 76892 USDC) after USDC Balaries for June with the treasury for the additional BAL required to pay out June Balaries in BAL (expected to be 22805 BAL ). This amount of BAL was calculated based on a BAL price of $3,66 on June 18th. After June has commenced the remaining BAL in the ops subDAO multisig will be sent back to treasury.

## Motivation

Preservation of USDC available for the Balancer DAO can be the prudent choice in the current market conditions. Therefore a swap of BAL (from the DAO treasury) <> USDC (from the ops subDAO Multisig ) with the Balancer DAO treasury would retain USDC on the DAO’s balance sheet and manage to pay the Balaries for June for people who are looking to get their Balary as discounted $veBAL.

## Risks (if applicable)

* While the ops subDAO made best efforts to poll contributors for their expected Balary, the official determination will happen at the end of the month via our monthly health-check.
* BAL price falls below 3,66 by the end of the month and a new proposal needs to be voted on to request the additional $BAL due to the decreased price of $BAL.

## Specification

* ops subDAO ( 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325 ) sends 76892 USDC to Balancer DAO treasury.
* Balancer DAO treasury ( 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f ) sends 22805 BAL to the ops subDAO multisig.",bullish
439,"## Summary

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V3 Ethereum. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-aave-v3-eth-pool-weth-parameters/15110).


## Motivation

The current yields of stETH and reth have been observed at 3.3% and 3.07% respectively. By adjusting the slope1 parameter of WETH, we aim to:

- Enhance Profitability in Leverage Loops: The proposed adjustment will make leverage loops more profitable for users.
- Align with stETH and reth Yields: The adjustment aims to set the slope1 slightly below the current yields of stETH and reth, ensuring Aave remains competitive.

Increased utilization of ETH reserve is expected to partly compensate for the slight loss of protocol revenue due to lower interest rate equilibrium.





## Specification

We propose two options for the weth slope1 parameters:

- **Option 1 (Conservative)**: Set slope1 to 3.2%. 10 bps below stETH yield but above rETH yield
- **Option 2 (Aggressive)**: Set slope1 to 2.8%. 50 below stETH yield & 23bps below rETH yield allowing both to be profitable.

Additionally, we propose reducing the optimalRatio to 80% to mitigate liquidity risks.

| Options       | new_slope1 | new_uopt | current_util | current_borrow_rate | new_util    | new_borrow_rate | current_borrow_revenue (WETH) | new_borrow_revenue (WETH) |

| Option 1 (Conservative) | 0.033      | 0.8      | 0.74         | 0.031               | 0.75 | 0.031           | 1363                    | 1384                  |
| Option 2 (Aggressive)   | 0.028      | 0.8      | 0.74         | 0.031               | 0.8         | 0.028           | 1363                    | 1331                  |

The deviation in the applied interest rate causes a small over-approximation for APYs <10%, but grows exponentially as can be seen below.

|Expected APY|Effective APY|Expected daily rate|Effective daily rate|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|4.00%|4.08%|0.01%|0.01%|
|5.00%|5.13%|0.01%|0.01%|

|10000.00%|2.69E+43%|1.30%|31.52%|

This difference is especially noticeable in the AMPL market, where the configured interest rate can go up to 10,002% at max utilization.

The AAVE Genesis team has been made aware and they will publish more guidance on the discrepancy.

This snapshot vote proposes two different curve configurations to adjust for the over-approximation:

### Curve #1 Rationale

As mentioned in [AIP-26](https://app.aave.com/governance/23-QmVXVtoDGzNtAPDCTWg7vYaezadKwsuHLrbgaTDRESQKzB), a nonlinear interest curve is more suited for AMPL's market and potentially other assets on AAVE's platform. It turns out that this over-approximation produces just such a curve.

The over-approximation mentioned above results in an exponentially growing curve which allows for defining a more suitable interest curve for AMPL. We propose the following parameters for [AAVE's default interest rate strategy](https://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/borrow-interest-rate#interest-rate-model), which produce the curve below:

|Optimal Utilization|Base rate|Slope1|Slope2|Maximum Effective APY|

|80|1.00%|2.00%|750.00%|186210.38%|

#### Rationale:

1. Accounting for the over-approximation of the existing Slope2=10,000% interest curve requires reducing the slope2 parameter.
2. Taking advantage of the exponential curve allows for:
           a. Setting a higher optimal utilization rate.
           b. Setting a higher maximum APY to reduce the potential for 
                utilization being at 100% for extended periods.
    without creating a too steep of an interest rate increase right above the optimal utilization rate.

### Curve #2 Rationale:

1. Accounting for the over-approximation of the existing Slope2=10,000% interest curve requires reducing slope2 parameter. 
2. Adjust curve parameters to have maximum APY similar to the intended APY in [AIP-26](https://app.aave.com/governance/23-QmVXVtoDGzNtAPDCTWg7vYaezadKwsuHLrbgaTDRESQKzB) This causes this curve to have higher likelihood for periods at 100% utilization compared to curve #1.

title: [TEMP CHECK] Allocating part of GHO Revenue to Safety Incentives
author: Marc Zeller, Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
date: 2023-06-07
---

## Abstract

This TEMP CHECK proposes the introduction of a dual reward system Safety Incentives, where a portion of GHO revenue is directed to the Aave Safety Incentives, enabling stakers (StkAAVE & StkBPT) to earn both AAVE and GHO tokens.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this TEMP CHECK is to enhance the sustainability of the Aave protocol by reducing its reliance on the Ecosystem Reserve of AAVE tokens for Safety Incentives. We propose a strategic shift towards harnessing protocol economic activity to generate ""real yield"" through the introduction of GHO as an additional Safety Incentive. 

By directing part of GHO revenue to the Safety Incentives, we aim to create a dual reward system, offering stakers both AAVE and GHO tokens. While the contribution of GHO to Safety Incentives may initially be a small fraction of the total incentives, it represents a significant step towards the protocol's maturity and sustainability. 

This proposal, suggests that the governance should adjust the distribution percentage quarterly, in response to market conditions.

As the Aave protocol already generates sustainable revenue that covers service provider costs, the introduction of GHO into the Safety Incentives mix is a viable and strategic move toward diversifying Safety Incentives and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the protocol.

### Potential Implementation

While technicals details of the implementation will be discussed at a potential ARFC stage of this proposal, and current stage is meant to gauge community's general interest, here's a diagram of a possible implementation, redirecting GHO revenue from Collector contract (dao treasury) to a splitter contract controlled by governance.

![image|2000x1028](upload://beyTiZ0BzFAVqdN2btMmu855a04.png)

### Initial Parameters

We propose to set a potential ""Gho Splitter"" contract with
- 80% toward COLLECTOR contract (Aave DAO treasury)
- 20% toward REWARDS_VAULT (controlling safety incentives)

## Next Steps

- If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage for service provider feedback and implementation discussions.

448,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-invest-fei-tribe-mta-tokens/2405).

Hi All, ZeKraken here, been posting on the forum for awhile, but first time submitting a proposal. Please let me know if you have any feedback on any of the below points.

## Motivation

As treasury swaps become more commonplace and now that the protocol fee has been turned on you should expect to see more yield farming activity coming from the Balancer DAO. In the vast majority of cases treasury assets should not just sit idly by, they should be put to work to earn yield while the tokens are in your possession. This is of course if the farming is done in a thoughtful, measured, and appropriate way.

## Investment Proposal

Below I outline the selected strategies for the FEI, TRIBE, and MTA that the Balancer DAO recently acquired through treasury swaps with those respective protocols.

### FEI / TRIBE:

2,454,000 FEI was acquired on Dec 9 2021, worth $2,448,559 at the time of this post

2,598,000 TRIBE was acquired on Dec 9 2021, worth $2,535,854 at the time of this post

ACTION: Deposit the full balance of both tokens to Rari Protocol’s Fuse platform- FeiRari [Fei DAO Pool](https://app.rari.capital/fuse/pool/8) TVL - $171,405,955

ESTIMATED RETURN:
FEI - $81,292 (in FEI) annually based on 3.32% APY
TRIBE - $718,407 annually (in TRIBE) based on 28.33% APR
Total - $799,699 annually

### MTA:

334,000 MTA was acquired on Dec 14 2021, worth $297,714 at the time of this post

ACTIONS:
[Stake](https://staking.mstable.app/#/stake) the full balance of MTA on the mstable platform giving us an equal amount of vMTA. staked MTA TVL - $6,361,104

Vote on the [dials](https://staking.mstable.app/#/dials) page, giving 100% of the voting balance to the MTA/WMATIC/WETH Balancer Polygon pool. This will bring additional MTA staking rewards to Balancer’s LPs in the Polygon pool. Note: the Mainnet Balancer pool is already capped at 10%, so no vote will be made for that dial at this time

ESTIMATED RETURN:
$76,333 annually (in MTA) based on 25.64% APY

OTHER:
We will not delegate mstable governance voting rights at this time. Rather the Balancer DAO will maintain the right to vote where it sees fit

For more information about the mstable’s staking/voting process see this [link](https://medium.com/mstable/emissions-controller-guide-4ceaf16199ac)

## Risks

There are a few risks to highlight around the depositing of treasury held assets. By far the biggest risk is smart contract risk which could result in partial or total loss of assets. However we are choosing to deposit on highly reputable platforms.

One option to combat the smart contract risk would be to utilize cover from Nexus Mutual for the two protocols. Currently those rates are 2.6% annually for both Rari and mstable (rates subject to change).

Another potential risk is around a reduced return on investment of this proposal vs. other potential strategies. There may be other strategies that could be deployed, but more often than not a much greater return comes with more risks. We feel we can get a decent return with an acceptable amount of risk.

Disclaimer: all figures and estimated returns are subject to change with market conditions, these figures presented here serve as a snapshot in time.

**Proposal Summary**

This is a proposal to enable a vETH/wstETH gauge on Balancer at:

https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xd3f8ab9c5928fdf53153e7757131ad7815fe3146000000000000000000000661

**Gauge address:**

https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ca33F22893a51A80Ed4ed8afebc900Ae813cA02

**Incentivization Strategy**

We will adopt a two-pronged incentivization strategy.

We will directly stream rewards to Aura, so that Balancer LPs can maximize yields. We will also bribe Hidden Hand for additional votes to reward our pools.

The bribes will be paid in wETH.

Rewards streamed to Aura will be paid in the form of either our reserve-based utility token, VEC, or in the form of psVEC. psVEC is the yield-boosted version of staked VEC (sVEC) that has been wrapped into a Pod on Peapods Finance to deliver increased rewards.

You can read more about VEC in our Protocol Description below.

**Protocol Description**

vETH is DeFi’s first Liquidity Position Derivative (LPD), introduced by Vector Reserve.

LPDs, or Liquidity Position Derivatives, are a never-before-seen asset class, capturing the yield from various LSTs and LRTs in a diversified fashion - while maximizing the ways to earn yield from each of them.

vETH can be minted using any approved asset on our dApp, and staked to earn yield from the following sources:

1. Staking and Restaking gains from holding LSTs and LRTs

2. LP fees from pairing these assets on various DEXs

3. Upcoming Superfluid Staking: The process of restaking liquidity positions on EigenLayer to earn additional yield. When this feature of EigenLayer goes live, we aim to be the market leader with a large treasury of LST/LRT-based LP positions backing vETH.

This approach allows us to generate best-in-market yield, giving vETH holders an advantage over holding standard LSTs or LRTs.

Our reserve-based utility token, VEC, has a symbiotic relationship with the vETH token. While vETH generates value for the Vector Reserve, being a great source of treasury revenue, VEC is emitted to generate liquidity for vETH pairs across multiple DEXs - ensuring the product remains competitive in all areas. Every VEC token is backed by assets within the Vector Reserve, which grow from a share of yield generated by vETH as well as LP positions acquired through bonding.

With over $30m TVL accumulated across vETH and sVEC since launch, Vector Reserve is pioneering the next stage of the liquid restaking revolution.

**Motivation**

The Balancer vETH/wstETH gauge will play an important early role in incentivising liquidity providers to help with the process of bootstrapping initial liquidity. It will then serve as an important source of liquidity for vETH on an ongoing basis, supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.

Oracles: No external oracles.

Audits: First audit can be viewed here:

https://github.com/JacoboLansac/audits/blob/main/solo/vector-reserve.md

Centralization Vectors: We have a small engineering team, with one lead engineer, but plans and funds are in place to scale as needed. The treasury is currently controlled by the multisig wallet.

Market History: Vector Reserve and vETH minting launched on Thursday 25th January 2024. Since then Vector TVL has rapidly accumulated over $30m in TVL. There have been no major volatility events attached to vETH since launch.

#### Summary:

[BIP-24](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-24-allocate-bal-to-a-ribbon-finance-vault/3209) and [BIP-227](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-227-upsize-bal-allocation-in-ribbon-finance-treasury-vault/4530) permitted the DAO to initially deposit BAL into a Ribbon Finance vault, and then upsize the position. Recently, Ribbon has since decided to deprecate this covered call strategy vault, and it no longer will be a place for the DAO to earn passive income. The proposal is meant to enable the DAO to claim back the deposited funds to hold in the treasury. 

#### Motivation:

As stated in the Summary, because this position will no longer be supported by Ribbon, the DAO should claim back these funds. Funds can be put to work elsewhere, but there is no sense in leaving them idle with nothing to be gained in the deprecated vault. 

#### Specification:

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the Ribbon Vault at `0x2a6B048eB15C7d4ddCa27db4f9A454196898A0Fe` by writing `initiateWithdraw` passing numShares as `200000000000000000000000`. This will take until the expiration of the next Ribbon round to register, at which time the BAL will be released for direct claim. 

Upon release, the DAO Multisig will interact with the same Ribbon vault as noted above and write the `completeWithdraw`

This Snapshot is designed to formalize the community’s consensus regarding the deployment of the GHO Stability Module (GSM) and its initial parameters.

## **Voting Options**

Given the current discussions regarding the effectiveness of the GHO Stability Module (GSM), we present two options via Snapshot to define the initial parameters. In these options, USDT and USDC are considered as underlying assets.

- Option A advocates for deploying the GSM, but with swap functionality paused. This implies that the module will remain inactive until the DAO decides to reactivate it. Such reactivation may involve parameter adjustments depending on market conditions. This option establishes the foundation for future GSM utilization, providing a straightforward setup without the need for complex deployments—just a simple AIP.

| Exposure Cap | 500,000 USDT |
| Facilitator Bucket Capacity | 500,000 GHO |
| Swap Active | False |
- Option B, considering the existing conditions with GHO at around $0.983, proposes specific parameters for immediate deployment with the swap functionality already activated. This signifies that the GSM will be enabled and ready for use upon deployment.

THX Network requests to whitelist its Gnosis Safe multisig address to enable it to lock B-80BAL-20WETH into veBAL and participate in governance and gauge voting.

# Motivation

THX Network allows creators and communities to create and embed ERC20 and ERC721 tokens in their platforms and social channels. The project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under agreement No 82888 (Blockpool) and No 824509 (Block.IS).

$THX is the project’s governance token launched in dec. 2021 using a Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) and has its main source of liquidity on Balancer’s Polygon deployment (~$900k TVL).

Our emerging DAO is about to diversify its treasury into $BAL and participate in Balancer’s governance.

# Specification

We’re requesting to whitelist the THX Network Gnosis Safe multisig, to interact with the veBAL contract. Address: 0x4a30c80A2c41312ce4ee79f730C8D84cAD9f7B31",bullish

Proposal to add gauge support for the pool WETH/LUSD/LQTY on Ethereum with a 10% emission cap.

- WETH 33.34%
- LUSD 33.33%
- LQTY 33.33%

## References/Useful links:

> New users are limited to 2 links per post... You'll find the link to all relevant resources [here](https://gov.curve.fi/t/proposal-to-whitelist-liquity-s-treasury-multisig-contract/4057)

## Protocol Description

Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD - a USD-pegged stablecoin and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.

In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. User’s borrowing against their ETH use decentralized 3rd party front ends. 

LUSD has proved its impeccable resilience in time by getting through severe market crashes untroubled.

LQTY is the secondary token issued by Liquity. It captures the fee revenue that is generated by the system. 

Liquity is the only lending service available in DeFi that is unstoppable & likewise, LUSD is the only stablecoin capable of resisting all kinds of censorship. Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free. No person or group has any control over the protocol — it is “set in stone” in smart contract code and can never be changed.

Number 1 on DeFi Safety

Liquity is the DeFi product with the highest process quality in the space, according to DeFi Safety. 

## Motivation

To summarize, LUSD is the Liquity protocol stablecoin. It uses ETH only as collateral. And LQTY is the secondary token issued by Liquity, capturing the fee revenue. Furthermore, LQTY stakers earn ETH and LUSD as rewards. And LUSD Stability pool depositors that earn LQTY and ETH. 

So there is already an established demand for the WETH/LUSD/LQTY pool. And even during the bear current market, the demand for Liquity has not diminished. On the contrary, since the mid-June market crash:

* $LUSD market cap went up from $150M to $185M (23%+ increase)
* Troves went up from 473 to 852 (80%+ increase)
* The number of $LQTY and $LUSD holders is also steadily growing in time
* Liquity is now no. 14 in TVL for DeFi protocols on Ethereum

There are two main reasons behind the growing demand. The first one is the recent events with collapsing centralized lending entities that have lost users’ funds and trust. An increasing number of them now choose Liquity, which offers no counterparty risk. 

The recently introduced Chicken Bonds are the second main reason for the increased interest in Liquity. LUSD Chicken Bonds offer an amplified yield-earning and trading opportunity for LUSD holders while helping to reduce the stablecoin premium and improve its liquidity. It has attracted 50m+ TVL in its first 50 days. 

In conclusion, the WETH/LUSD/LQTY pool should attract significant interest in the Balancer community. Besides, the recent release of LUSD Chicken Bonds further increased the demand for such a pool.

## Specifications

1. **Governance**: Liquity has no governance. It is built to maximize trustlessness and decentralization. 
2. **Oracles**: Chainlink is Liquity’s primary oracle. They are the largest player in the oracle space, have an excellent track record, are sufficiently decentralized, and are constantly improving their systems. 

    Tellor is Liquity’s secondary (fallback) oracle. They’re fully decentralized — price data is requested, with a “tip” attached — and miners compete to push accurate data and win the tip. Inaccurate data is disputed, and the threat of stake-slashing incentivizes honest price reporting

3. **Audits**: Multiple security audits have been conducted by various auditors. All relevant documents are available in the documentation. Additionally, Liquity runs a bug bounty program with Hats Finance. 
4. **Centralization vectors**: There are no centralization vectors. Liquity is built to have maximized resilience. 
5. **Market History**: Over the last months, we have observed a premium on LUSD results from a structural unbalance between offer and demand. It was further aggravated by recent events leading more and more users to worry about the censorability of centralized stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) and decentralized stablecoins primarily backed by centralized ones (like DAI or FRAX). 

    The situation led to a considerable demand surge for censorship-resistant stablecoins that only LUSD can answer since there is no other alternative with a significant TVL. Thus, we have seen LUSD trading at a premium and slightly above the peg, partially caused by the increased demand for LUSD. Nevertheless, hard peg mechanisms are built into the system between $1 and $1.10, and soft peg incentives in between. Further, Chicken Bonds are already helping to reduce the stablecoin premium, and this effect will strengthen as the protocol grows. 


    You can check here the historical data of LUSD and LQTY

6. **Value**: There is a proven in-time demand for WETH/LUSD/LQTY and the pool will be stable and beneficial for the Balancer community.

459,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-v2-liquidity-mining-program/1678/42).

## Motivation

Crypto moves fast and the AMM space is as competitive as ever. In order to stay relevant and to attract significant liquidity, Balancer needs to implement a flexible Liquidity Mining Program which targets high priority pools and can respond quickly to changing market conditions. 

Unfortunately, this can result in significant overhead for normal BAL governance. Constantly weighing in, voting, and checking the forums on a daily basis can be a hassle for most BAL holders. 

As a result, this proposes having a dedicated committee of core members to the Balancer protocol to lead this charge and ensure that the protocol is always incentivizing the right pools, at the right time.

## Specification

Balancer V2 Liquidity mining incentives will operate in **three** tiers governed by a combination of BAL governance and the Ballers Committee. 

![Screen Shot 2021-04-13 at 9.14.21 PM|690x74](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/98f34188a9d69eb4eac9cd5149b3f831a85a27a7.png) 

Tier 1 will be voted on by BAL governance while Tier 2 and Tier 3 are voted on by the Ballers committee. 

**All Balancer community members will retain the right to make proposals and signal support for T2 & T3 Liquidity Mining inclusion.** The Ballers Committe will act as a liason between community sentiment and formal changes to the program. Discussions on Liquidity Mining inclusion will be open for all community members on both Discord and the Forum. 

**The Ballers Committee will have no control over the Tier 1 slots**. Instead, they will be governed by normal BAL governance which will be put up for vote every 12 weeks. Additionally, all decisons made by the Ballers Committee (*along with voting addresses*) will be made public for everyone to see prior to implementation.

In order to accomodate for sufficient yield to attract liquidity on certain pools, more than one slot may be allocated to a single pool by consuming additional T2 and T3 slots as voted on by the committee. 

The timing for changes on each tier outlined above is a guideline--BAL governance and the Ballers Committee will always have the right to change tiers if the market conditions deem it necessary (*examples include rug pulls, bugs, and other issues which would require quick response by governance)*.  

### BAL/ETH Pool

In order to mitigate the reduction in yields for the BAL/ETH pair, **the Ballers committee will aim to target the existing returns in V1 (60-70% APY) through the use of additional T2 & T3 slots.**

It's important to highlight that there are a significant amount of variables that will affect the BAL/ETH APY (as well as all other pools). This includes amount of liquidity migrated during the transition, amount staked, tiers consumed, etc. 

With all those variables, The Ballers Committee will be responsible for trying to ensure that the APY on the BAL/ETH pool are in line with the above. 

### Transition from V1 to V2 Mining
The transition from Balancer V1 liquidity mining to V2 will be gradual and take several weeks. This will start with only a few of the Tier 3 (T3) and Tier 2 (T2) slots being filled by top priority pools, with new slots being ""activated’’ on a rolling basis, targeting every week. 

At every activation, the corresponding amount of BAL is subtracted from the weekly amount available in the V1 liquidity mining program. This way the total BAL distributed through liquidity mining between both V1 and V2 pools will always stay the same at 145,000 BAL per week.

As the community becomes more confident that there are no vulnerabilities in the V2 smart contracts, more of the liquidity mining program is expected to shift from V1 to V2 until the entirety of the V1 allocation is exhausted. This can happen by having more of the available slots being assigned to V2 pools, and also by upgrading a V2 pool to a higher tier.

The transition period will aim to take roughly 8 weeks from the start of V2 mining. **At the end of the transition period, Tier 1 slots will be allocated to these pools:**

* 80/20 BAL/ETH, dynamic fee
* 60/40 ETH/DAI, dynamic fee
* 50/50 ETH/WBTC, dynamic fee
* DAI/USDC/USDT stable pool

### Ballers Committe

The selection of Tier 2 and Tier 3 Liquidity Mining Pools will discussed on a weekly basis according to community input and signal, and voted on formally by the Ballers Commmitee. 

**The Ballers Committe is open to everyone. Any engaged individuals in the community can be elected by fellow community members to join the committee.** More on this below. 

**The goal of using the Ballers Committee is to avoid extensive overhead on BAL governance as well as to provide quick responses according to market conditions.** 

Ballers will use a specific Snapshot space (*separate space from traditional BAL governance*) so that the community can easily keep track of those decisions.

All decisions made by Ballers will be made public on Balancer’s forum shortly after the end of the committee weekly meetings (ideally within 2-3 hours). Highly respected individuals and working groups in the space may also be invited by Ballers to these meetings to provide strategic input. **That said, they will have no formal voting rights on Snapshot.**

### Additional Background on Ballers 

*Ballers are active members of the community that have gone above and beyond by contributing significant resources and time to the Balancer Protocol.* There are currently 10 Ballers in the community as assigned by [their tag on Discord](https://discord.gg/ARJWaeF). 

Ballers are currently elected by the team at Balancer Labs, however, there intends to be a formal governance process by BAL holders surrounding the election of future Ballers and the encompassing committee. 

With that, The Ballers group is expected to expand and rotate over time, encouraging regular community members to keep a high level of engagement so they can eventually become Ballers too!

BAL governance has the ultimate power to elect and dismiss Ballers through Snapshot votes. Ballers and the broader community will constantly assess how participative Ballers are and how good their decisions on the allocation of liquidity mining slots are.

## Drawbacks

- **The Ballers Committee is a small group of individuals and can poses centralization risks, collusion, etc.** It's important to note that BAL governance always retains the right to remove Ballers from their position. In addition, becoming a Baller is a selective process and requires a significant amount dedication to the protocol--meaning they're extremely aligned with the success of Balancer! 
- **This structure would eliminate liquidity incentives for the long-tail of pools.** This is true, however, the upgrade to Balancer V2 drastically increases gas efficiency and creates a natural incentive for project teams to drive liquidity to Balancer given its competitive conditions for trading, namely lower gas costs. Importantly, some competitors don't offer liquidity incentives *at all* and still have sufficient liquidity for the long-tail of assets. We believe that V2's upgrade is substantial enough to compete with this market dynamic. 

## Summary

Balancer V2 liquidity mining will operate in 3 tiers. Tier 1 will be voted on by governance on a recurring basis while Tier 2 and Tier 3 pools will be strategically assigned by the Ballers Committee based on community sentiment. 

It's important to highlight that certain pools may be allocated more than one slot by the committee. For instance, the BAL/ETH pool may be elected multiple slots in order for the APY to tentatively match the BAL/ETH APY on V1 as mentioned.

All community members will always have the ability to signal their support for liquidity mining inclusion for T2 and T3 pools in order to guide the committee. 

The transition from V1 to V2 will take place over a targeted ~8 weeks with BAL liquidity mining allocations incrementally migrated to V2 on a weekly basis. Throughout the entirety of the migration, the weekly BAL distribution will remain constant at 145,000 BAL per week spread across both Balancer V1 and V2.",bearish

The BPT from this pool is staked in the [Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module) that secures the Aave Protocol. 

## Motivation

As a continued show of good faith in this important partnership, we should maintain the current rate of BAL rewards (12,500 BAL per week) until January 20th, 2022. Currently our commitment to this rate of rewards is set to expire on September 20th.

- **Distribution duration:** 14 days
- **Start block:** 9375400 (approx. 9am UTC on July 22nd)
- **Finish block:** 9778600 (approx. 9am UTC on August 5th)
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.00992 CAKE

## Max Stake per wallet: 
25 AXS (approx. $460) 

Stake CAKE tokens to earn AXS tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 3,000 AXS (Approx. $50K worth)
- **Distribution duration:** 14 days
- **Start block:** 9375400 (approx. 9am UTC on July 22nd)

- **Token rewards per block:** 0.00744 AXS


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE


“But where will the CAKE and AXS for these rewards come from, Chef?”
Simple. We will use Treasury funds and buy CAKE and AXS tokens for these Syrup pools, 	from the market.


# The Farm:
In addition to the Syrup Pool, we are hosting an AXS-BNB farm that will have 1x farm multiplier in CAKE rewards. Remember, liquidity means less slippage, more trading volume and more CAKE burned as a result!


# What is Axie Infinity?

Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired digital pet universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets (known as Axies). Currently, players can start the game by purchasing Axies from other players on the Marketplace.

All in-game assets and Axie-related data can be accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe.

The project team aims to build a platform that encompasses the characteristics of a social network and jobs platform by creating a strong community and play-to-earn opportunities.

## Summary

This proposal aims to delegate the [2M](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xaf23dc5983230e9eeaf93280e312e57539d098d0) ARB voting power held in the Balancer DAO treasury to karpatkey's delegation multisig. This voting power will be actively used by karpatkey in the Arbitrum governance process.

## Abstract

Since the passing of [[BIP-103]](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xddc174b931a0d2e5e32276a3d0d7110367797dd24248f078d0f7876d0987c92f), karpatkey has been serving as the treasury manager for Balancer DAO, a role that involves active governance interaction. In this capacity, karpatkey has engaged in governance across various protocols and chains. The Balancer DAO has recognised our expertise and commitment, selecting us through the [BIP-452](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x3a8d63ce6dbebf9b559fcd1acb367ce0c1625b805bde893b62c5a2ba2e827cbc) to be your delegate on Aave. Since December 2023, karpatkey has also been an active delegate in the Arbitrum DAO, contributing to the launch of their Arbitrum delegation [platform](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/karpatkey-delegate-communication-thread/20085).

As delegates in Arbitrum, we have [provided research](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-research/20630) to the Treasury and Sustainability working group. This research presented insights into how the Arbitrum DAO could address treasury management challenges, including recommended practices, tools, or service providers the DAO should adopt. 

Additionally, karpatkey serves as one of six members on the screening committee for the [Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP)](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5050ef61a4cbff56344ad558c2c880b547fef3b81df607818238ed3031f840b3). This committee will oversee the review and screening of Real World Asset (RWA) service providers that are applying to STEP. This program will support the RWA ecosystem on Arbitrum by diversifying 35 million ARB from their treasury.


## Motivation
This proposal aims to establish an ARB delegation, empowering karpatkey to provide enhanced support for initiatives that align the Balancer and Arbitrum ecosystems. 

karpatkey, as the treasury manager for the Balancer DAO and an active delegate in Arbitrum, is not just a passive participant. With this positioning and awareness, the karpatkey team will actively and effectively represent the Balancer DAO's delegation.

karpatkey's active participation and awareness as a delegate are evident in its past initiatives. For instance, we led a proposal on behalf of the Arbitrum community on Aave, which successfully [removed ARB from isolation mode](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-remove-arb-from-isolation-mode-on-arbitrum-market/16703). This initiative was mutually beneficial for both Aave and Arbitrum, showcasing the potential for future initiatives led by karpatkey. The same can be said of the proposal led by karpatkey to [deepen the synergies between Aave and the Balancer Ecosystem](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061), which helped to make Balancer an important source of GHO's liquidity. 

By delegating this voting power, karpatkey can utilise it to vote in alignment with Balancer's interests on topics such as:
* Incentive programs;
* Arbitrum's ARB on-chain liquidity enhancement; and
* Arbitrum's treasury diversification strategies.

## Specification
The Balancer treasury vault managed by karpatkey `0xaf23dc5983230e9eeaf93280e312e57539d098d0` on Arbitrum One will interact with the ARB `0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548` token contract by calling the `delegate` function, passing the karpatkey governance multisig `0x583E3EDc26E1B8620341bce90547197bfE2c1ddD` as the delegatee.

These actions will delegate the ARB voting power in the Balancer's Treasury wallet on Arbitrum One to karpatkey's governance multi-sig.

471,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas/1437). If approved, changes would take effect at **00:00 UTC on Monday, March 8**.

On behalf of the Balancer community, I’d like to propose significant modifications to the ongoing gas reimbursement campaign. We have heard some concerns that the campaign is confusing and that it isn’t clear how much BAL a user will receive for a given trade. During these times of network congestion and high gas costs, we want to provide everyone with an opportunity to trade on Balancer. With that in mind, it doesn’t seem fair to ask users to exercise blind faith and wait until “next Wednesday” to find out what they’ve earned from trading. We would like to make every effort to simplify the campaign and improve transparency; what you see is what you get, or at least as close as possible. We plan to accomplish this by removing various sources of uncertainty from the reimbursement calculations so that it is possible to get an estimate ahead of time and display it to the user at the time of trade submission.

# The Proposal
Allocate **30,000 BAL** from the Ecosystem Fund to the “BAL for Gas'' campaign. There is no fixed time period; the budget is consumed on a **first-come, first-served** basis. When the budget is exhausted, the campaign is suspended until it is replenished by BAL governance.

For **each eligible trade made through the Balancer Exchange Proxy**, award claimable BAL tokens to the trader. An eligible trade is a trade containing one or more eligible swaps, where an eligible swap is a **swap between any two tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json)**. Claims are made available at the [BAL claims interface](https://claim.balancer.finance/#/) on Wednesday (UTC time) following the close of the weekly period (00:00 UTC Monday - 23:59 UTC Sunday) in which the trade occurred.

The amount of gas to be reimbursed is predetermined by the number of eligible swaps within the transaction:

![table|690x185](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/dd83c24ba43bd36e91396a5b6296f4c92cc986c2.png)

For converting gas to BAL, use the **median gas price of the enclosing block** and the **BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko** closest to the block time.

# Motivation
The proposal above may seem familiar, but there are some very important distinctions between this and the previous reimbursement program. All modifications share the common goal of improving user experience, which we believe is a matter of simplification and transparency.

First, this proposed campaign makes no effort to account for the _actual_ expenses of the user. Both the amount of gas consumed by the transaction and the gas price ultimately paid are irrelevant. Instead, deterministic figures are favored: the amount of gas is fixed depending on the number of swaps, and the gas price is the block median, rather than the user’s own price. It is simply too difficult to accurately predict the parameters of a given transaction ahead of time, whereas it is much easier to predict block-wide parameters. Predictability informs transparency.

The second major shift pertains to the budget. The existing program allocates a fixed weekly budget, which can sometimes necessitate cuts to the reimbursements in order to avoid excess spending. Such cuts can only be known _after_ the weekly period has ended, and therefore the existence of a weekly budget renders any trade-time estimates useless. In contrast, here we propose a fixed total budget which is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. This allows us to add reimbursement estimates to the Exchange UI at the time of the trade. If there are still funds remaining in the budget, the user will see an estimate of the amount of BAL to be awarded; and if the budget is exhausted, then the user will simply be informed as such and the estimate will be zero. When the well runs dry, BAL governors can decide whether to replenish and continue the campaign.

Third, the BAL/ETH price model is modified. Whereas the ongoing campaign uses the median price for the whole weekly period, the proposed campaign uses the price as close as possible to the actual block time. Knowing the approximate price at the time of the trade allows us to make informed estimates about the amount of BAL to be awarded.

![image|690x120](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/e00a59183e29b37e29369999caccc6035028b810.png)

Finally, the fixed amounts of gas (130k, 220k, 300k, 400k) were chosen so that only 1% of all trades, on average, would be overcompensated. This should be sufficient to prevent gaming the system for profit, but nonetheless **we reserve the right to filter out suspicious activity**. The Balancer Exchange UI will never perform more than four swaps in a single trade, which is why only four numbers are provided; any transactions containing 5+ swaps must belong to bots, whereas the target audience is end users. We simply cap the reimbursement amount at 400,000 gas; any additional eligible swaps beyond the first four will yield no further benefit.

# Mechanics
Although every effort is made to be as transparent and accurate as possible, there is still a very small amount of room for error. Here we will detail how the BAL amounts are computed both at trade time (estimated) and at dispersal time (actual).

At the time of the trade:

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **estimated** gas price for display purposes is the median from the last few blocks according to the `getGasPrice()` function from the web3 provider. This should provide a good corollary to the median of the actual trade block, which cannot be known in advance.
4. The **estimated** BAL/ETH price for display purposes is queried from the large [80/20 BAL/WETH pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x59a19d8c652fa0284f44113d0ff9aba70bd46fb4/). This acts as a real-time oracle which isn’t worth manipulating because it is only used to display an estimate and not to compute an actual award amount.
5. The user will see, in one summary number, the final result of #1-4: the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for this particular trade, assuming there are still funds left in the budget. A USD estimate is also provided for completeness, with the BAL/USD price being queried from CoinGecko’s API.

The UI changes are still being finalized, but as a mockup consider the image below.

![image2|485x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/1174949f6ce920677d9102bbf6ee0a35627776b8.png)

At dispersal time (computed by the [open source mining scripts](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts)):

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **actual** gas price is the median from the block containing the trade. We will filter out artificially low-price transactions which are sometimes included by miners and can skew the median - these are typically 0-gwei or 1-gwei transactions.
4. The **actual** BAL/ETH price is queried from the CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

It should be clear that the only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are most likely quite small: the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block, and the 80/20 BAL/WETH price may not perfectly match CoinGecko’s BAL/ETH price. All in all, the user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time, and this improved user experience should bring more traders to the campaign.

### Title: [TEMP CHECK]  Onboard Catapulta as Aave V3 Deployment Service Provider

### Author:  Kartojal & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

### Date: 2024-03-13

---

### **Summary**

The following proposal is to onboard [Catapulta](https://catapulta.sh/) as a Development Service Provider. The goal of Catapulta is to perform production and testnet Aave V3 instance deployments in EVM networks, approved by the Aave DAO.

### **Motivation**

The founder of Catapulta, David Racero, worked previously as Solidity Developer in Aave Companies during 2 years and a half, and was the main responsible for deployments scripting of Aave V2 and Aave V3 during the whole time at the company. 

Catapulta has created a smart contracts deployments platform that aims to automate certain manual workflows during deployments, like deployments reports, broadcasting txs and verifications in block explorers, allowing to speed up Web3 development cycles.

### Specification

Catapulta, as a potential Development Service Provider to the Aave DAO, will be focusing on the following scope of actions:

- Perform the deployment of new Aave V3 instances in EVM networks, in testnet and production, approved by the Aave DAO via Snapshot.
- Develop activation proposals for the Aave DAO to initialize Aave V3 instances, following all security procedures.
- Maintenance of Aave V3 deployment scripting to support new EVM networks.

The production deployment services will only happen once a positive [technical evaluation](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-deployments-technical-evaluation-framework-of-a-network/10237) AND snapshot approval from the Aave DAO.

Catapulta will reject any Aave V3 deployments requests from competitors or forks, and will pursue full transparency during the duration of the services. Catapulta will be in touch with all parties involved during the onboarding of a new Aave V3 instance, ex risk contributors, growth, development and security service providers.

### Duration & Proposed Budget

The duration for this service proposal will be 6 months.

Due the nature of the proposed services, that will only happen once a positive technical evaluation AND approval from the Aave DAO Governance, Catapulta has opted for a flat fee per production deployment.

- Fixed $15.000 USD in GHO or USDC, plus gas reimbursement, per Aave V3 production deployment, paid at the activation proposal.

479,"## Rationale

This VIP proposes a new set of parameters for VAI based on this discussion 1.

## Summary

Increase the steepness of the interest rate curve of VAI to incentivize VAI close to $1.

## Motivation

- Harden the peg by making it expensive to borrow VAI when the VAI price is low.
- Provide a better rate for borrowers when VAI is at $1.

## Specification

Modification of this VIP:
- baseRate: 3% (from 4%)
- floatRate: 4000% (from 225%)

We provide an exemple of the implication of the changes in the forum post.

This VIP doesn’t enable VAI borrowings, this will be enabled in a following VIP contingent to having a significant healthy buffer in the VAI USDT PSM.

## Risk Analysis

- Reduction of earnings if VAI stays at $1
- Increasing the VAI borrow rate might reduce VAI borrowings and TVL

**Title:** [ARFC] Add ARB to Arbitrum Aave v3
**Author:** @fig - Flipside Crypto
**Created** : 2023-05-26

---
## Abstract

This proposal is the next step to add ARB to Aave v3 on Arbitrum.

## Summary

Following the successful [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x058f8e69b69a27495ee9796fc6952326d94eb24fe0071050db166d5d5e1da242) to add Aave v3 on Arbitrum, this  proposal progresses the asset listing to the next stage in the Governance cycle, incorporating parameters provided by Risk  Managers.

## Motivation

Adding support for ARB in Arbitrum v3 pools adds greater TVL and user experience to the increasingly popular Aave v3 Arbitrum market - and additional revenue opportunities for Aave.

By enabling borrowing, it allows users and institutions to take a unique position on this Governance token as the network matures and builds a decentralized community.

Furthermore, it more closely aligns the Aave community with Arbitrum and, by extension, Ethereum.

Additionally, it allows for creative uses of ARB received by the DAO to seed initial liquidity.

## Specifications

ARB may be listed with the following risk parameters:

|Parameter|Value|
| --- | --- |
|Isolation Mode|Yes|
|Borrowable|Yes|
|Collateral Enabled|Yes|
|Supply Cap (ARB)|20M|
|Borrow Cap (ARB)|16.5M|
|Debt Ceiling|$14M|
|LTV|50.00%|
|LT|60.00%|
|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|
|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|
|Reserve Factor|20.00%|
|Variable Base|0.00%|
|Variable Slope1|7.00%|
|Variable Slope2|300.00%|
|Uoptimal|45%|
|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|

Thank you to both @ChaosLabs and @Gauntlet for delivering speedy recommendations.

## Disclaimer

The information provided above about ARB is from public sources and Flipside Crypto cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.

The Arbitrum Foundation or Offchain Labs has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and we are doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.

This ARFC has been prepared solely to promote further discussion, evaluate presented risk parameters, and finalize the proposal before heading to the AIP stage.

**Motivation**:

Recently the Xave Finance team recently was notified of a [potential bug report](https://twitter.com/XaveFinance/status/1725397072852254755?s=20). As advised by the team, removing all liquidity is best for LPs at this time. The Xave team has communicated to the Maxis that their plan is to deploy new pools and disclose further information on the situation in the near future. Due to this migration, there is no sense in incentivizing liquidity via Balancer gauges, and killing all currently active ones is the best way forward.

Title: [ARFC] Deploy whitelabel Aave V3 Market - Reental 
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-26

---

# **Summary**
The current proposal aims to deploy a “whitelabel” version of Aave V3 for Reental tokens on the Polygon network. By allowing friendly forks of Aave V3, Aave can increase its technology adoption and provide an alternative source of revenue and synergies for the DAO and third-party teams.

### **Motivation**

Reental, in collaboration with Reental Master LLC, a protocol offering utility and functionalities associated with the Real World Assets (RWA) market, aims to deploy its collateralization market (ReenLever) on Aave's V3 platform. Reental stands as a global leader with extensive experience in real estate asset tokenization, having tokenized over $46 million across four countries on three continents. It uniquely combines these security tokens with its own utility token ($RNT), delivering significant benefits to its community of over 16,000 investors.

Reental is a key player in the global tokenization of RWAs, specifically in the real estate market. It offers investment opportunities in real estate assets to users worldwide. Currently, Reental has tokenized over 65 properties across four countries (USA, Spain, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic), totaling $25 million, with a community of 16,000 users from over 80 countries. 

With this track record, Reental stands as the only company worldwide with tokenized properties across four countries on three continents, aspiring to become a global entity with properties tokenized worldwide and partnerships with some of the sector's most prominent corporations: Civitas, Grupo ClerHP, Grupo BEC, M2Capital, Sibarys Capital, and others. 

In addition to its demonstrated traction as a leader in the Spanish-speaking RWA market over the past three years, Reental recently launched its utility token: $RNT. This tool enables the community to actively participate in the protocol, foster mutual growth, and transform user investors into stakeholders, creating a virtuous growth cycle.

### Specification

We are witnessing a highly favorable trend and narrative regarding RWAs, and Aave can maintain its leadership by embracing the unstoppable growth of this ecosystem. Reental can contribute to this growth with its collateralized lending market.

Reental proposes launching a whitelisted Aave V3 instance, bringing along the current $46 million tokenized volume, which could be collateralized immediately, and the potential for billions more in the coming years.

20% of the generated fees will be allocated to the Aave DAO. While the Reental market is not currently a significant business prospect for the Aave DAO, and it is not expected to be a significant revenue driver, the market has an interesting value proposition for off-chain collateral-based liquidity protocols.

This integration bridges the off-chain world with the on-chain realm through these RWAs, which are already yielding returns for investors.

Reental will assume the role of risk admin for this market, adding new properties monthly.

### Paragraph Summary

LUSD is stablecoin minted directly by the protocol users by opening a Trove and depositing ETH as collateral. Loans are interest-free, with a 0.5% base initiation fee. All the contracts of the Liquity protocol are immutable, which makes LUSD the most trustless stablecoin currently available on the Ethereum mainnet.

LUSD is overcollateralized by ETH with two main mechanisms helping it keep its peg: first, LUSD can be redeemed for ETH at face value (i.e., 1 LUSD for $1 of ETH). Secondly, there is a minimal collateral ratio of 110%. Both mechanisms respectively create a price floor and ceiling through arbitrage opportunities.

Since the protocol is immutable, no additional developments are planned, yet the Liquity team is working on another project that will prove synergetic with LUSD.

LUSD’s resilience makes it a highly sought-after stablecoin for DAOs and protocols looking to diversify their treasury and users looking for cost-effective leverage on ETH. The current focus is to grow the DeFi ecosystem around LUSD to enable more diverse use cases.

This proposal aims to add LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave v2 mainnet (0% LTV). If the current proposal is met with enthusiasm, other proposals will follow suit.

### Specifications

#### AIP author status

I, TokenBrice, author of this ARC [recently joined](https://tokenbrice.xyz/joining-liquity/) the Liquity team to help with DeFi strategy.

#### Overview of the project and token

Liquity is a protocol offering cost-efficient leverage using ETH as collateral. While its base design can be described as similar to Maker/DAI, there are several key differences:

* Only ETH is accepted as collateral to maximize the protocol's trustlessness and resilience.
* There is no interest fee on Liquity. Instead, the borrowers pay a predictable initiation fee starting at 0,5% — and ramping up algorithmically when needed to protect the protocol.
* Liquidations are close to instant, and enabled by a protocol-level backstop: [the stability pool](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations), a reserve of LUSD deposited by users.
* Just like Aave, Liquity uses ChainLink as the main price feed. However there is a [fallback system](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations) in place, switching to Tellor, if the ChainLink price feed data is deemed incoherent.
* Since the contracts are immutable, there is no governance. There is still a token associated with the protocol – [LQTY](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6dea81c8171d0ba574754ef6f8b412f2ed88c54d), but it’s used for incentivization and fee-sharing purposes only.
* The minimal required collateralization ratio is lower – at 110%, increasing the capital efficiency of the protocol. This is possible thanks to the stability pool and instant liquidation mechanism which also helps maintain the peg by acting as a liquidity buffer. A failsafe mechanism, called the Recovery Mode, is triggered when the total collateralization ratio of the protocol falls below 150%. Being an exceptional measure, the Recovery Mode enforces more substantial restrictions on the Troves, such as temporary minimal collateralization of 150%, until the total collateralization ratio of the protocol recovers. So far, it was only triggered once in the early days of the protocol.

#### Positioning within Aave Ecosystem

LUSD is a stablecoin offering some genuinely unique features, the leading one being the trustlessness of the whole Liquity protocol. In that sense, LUSD is one of the most resilient stablecoin and the most decentralized. Similar to the addition of RAI on Aave, having LUSD will help Aave diversify from the current dominance of centralized stablecoins such as USDC used for borrowing.

Furthermore, as mentioned above, this proposal is the first step. Several others could follow to nurture the relationship between Aave and Liquity further:

1. Enablement of LUSD as collateral (LTV>0%)
2. Enablement of efficiency mode against selected stablecoins once v3 mainnet is live.
3. Addition of LUSD on Aave/Optimism + potential enablement as collateral + again enablement of the efficiency mode.

I believe that LUSD as a borrowable asset will be met with a strong demand: it will be the first time such a resilient stablecoin could be borrowed on Aave and the first protocol where LUSD is borrowable.

#### History of the project and its components

The Liquity protocol was launched on the 5th of April, 2021. As the code is immutable, there has been no update since then. However, the team is still actively working on the protocol' DeFi integrations, such as supporting LUSD liquidity on Curve.

Since the demand for LUSD is directly dependent on the appetite for leverage on ETH, the LUSD supply had varied quite a bit since the launch, with the highest point around 1.5B LUSD when ETH reached a peak price of ~$4K. The following correction on ETH, with the lowest point around $2K, led to a drastic reduction in the LUSD supply – this episode is the first and so far unique time when the Recovery Mode was triggered. Since this episode, the supply has stabilized more and is now around 325M LUSD. This episode was the first massive stress test for the Liquity Protocol, which handled it gracefully – a recap is available here:

https://www.liquity.org/blog/how-liquity-handled-its-first-big-stress-test

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiezquc6y7pkordcigvzwfwhgjfagnilxeweeuawycupuq6gsb3jxa)
    


Since the protocol launch, various DeFi integrations have been built on top of the Liquity Protocol, here are some of the most notable:

* A Curve pool (+integration on Convex and Yearn) was created against the 3Pool and became the main liquidity source. It’s amongst the stablecoin pools with the highest base APR due to the trading volume it processes.
* DeFiSaver offers some automation features to streamline Troves management.
* B.Protocol delivered an auto-compounder for depositors of the Stability Pool who wish to keep a 100% LUSD exposure: https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity
* Some protocols, such as Olympus or Fei Protocol diversified part of their treasury to LUSD to shield themselves from volatility with an unstoppable stablecoin. Synthetix is also using LUSD on Optimism to stabilize the sUSD price.

#### LUSD usage

A sizeable share of the LUSD supply (~66%) is deposited into the Stability Pool, the liquidity backstop for liquidations: https://etherscan.io/address/0x66017d22b0f8556afdd19fc67041899eb65a21bb

The top LUSD holders also include other protocols, such as Olympus, DXdao or some treasuries.

LUSD is also present on Optimism, where Synthetix provided a wrapper contract to help stabilize the sUSD price (~45M LUSD) + to provide liquidity on Velodrome (the pool is ~9M TVL, against USDC).

#### LUSD Emission

The only way to mint LUSD is to open a Trove, while LUSD is burned through debt repayment, either directly (by the trove owner) or through redemptions (by an arbitrageur).

#### Token & Protocol Permissions

The LUSD token as well as the whole Liquity protocol are fully permissionless. There is no multisig and no governance, and no-one can interact with the contract underlying the protocol in an administrative manner: all users are the same in front of the contract, just like with Uniswap v2 for instance.

#### Market Data

As of June 03, the total LUSD supply is around 325M. There is about $90M of total liquidity in pools where LUSD is involved.

The main liquidity source for LUSD is the Curve pool with ~$65M TVL: https://curve.fi/lusd

There are also liquidity sources against FRAX, USDC and DAI on Uniswap V3: https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0

There is a 4-tokens pool on Saddle Finance (alUSD, FEI, FRAX, LUSD) with $25M liquidity: https://saddle.exchange/#/pools/D4/deposit

Finally, on Optimism, LUSD is the largest stablecoin pool with around ~$9M against USDC https://app.velodrome.finance/liquidity/0x207addb05c548f262219f6bfc6e11c02d0f7fdbe

The observed volume can vary depending on the market's activity (massive ETH price movements are usually followed by days with large volume), with a baseline around $3M daily volume (mainnet only).

#### Social channel data

The main channel for the community to gather is the Liquity Discord server, with around 6.5K members. For outward-facing communications, the main channel used is the @LiquityProtocol Twitter account with over 28.5K followers. We also regularly publish newsletter updates to subscribers (2.5K) and have recently become more active on LinkedIn (<1K).

Number of transactions on LUSD: 197,461 (+ ~2000 on Optimism)

Number of token holders on LUSD: 4758 (+ ~100 on Optimism)

### Risk Assessment

We followed [Aave's risk assessment methodology](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/methodology) to provide all the necessary metrics:

I'm not sure what the proper rating is for a stablecoin with no governance and immutable code should be when it comes to the ""Permission"" category, so I went with an A to reflect that in that regard, LUSD is almost as safe as ETH. Feel free to challenge me if you think that is not appropriate.

486,"Current parameters:
Supply cap: `500k sAVAX` → `1m sAVAX` (proposed increase of supply cap)
Borrow cap: 0 sAVAX
DEX Liquidity: ~$40m

Normal mode:
LTV: 20%
Liquidation threshold: 30%
Liquidation penalty: 10%

E-mode:
Asset: AVAX
Max LTV: 92.5%

**Proposal: Increase of supply cap by 100% to 1m sAVAX (~$23m)**

The current sAVAX supply cap on v3 is 500k sAVAX (~ $11.5m) and has been reached within two weeks of listing.
Due to the efficacy of E-mode, where sAVAX can only be used as collateral to borrow AVAX, protocols built on top of aAVAsAVAX (AAVE Avalanche sAVAX) have seen extensive growth with deposits at max supply cap.
The proposal’s goal is to suggest an increase of 100% to 1m sAVAX supply cap via the fast-track process as outlined here (https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-v3-supply-borrow-cap-management-fast-track-process/8045).

Reasons for increase:

**DEX Liquidity and Conversion Rate**: Despite market conditions, DEX liquidity has remained around $40m across Platypus, TraderJoe and Pangolin. This can facilitate healthy liquidations if ever necessary. However, at the time of writing, there has not been any necessary liquidations of sAVAX on AAVE.

As Liquid Staked AVAX, there exists a pseudo peg to AVAX on secondary markets such as Platypus. Due to the nature of the asset, the conversion rate of sAVAX:AVAX has been quite closely maintained due to natural price arbitrage and a 15-days redemption window.

**LTV and E-mode**: sAVAX has a modest LTV on normal mode, at 20%, where there exists a healthy spread of price deviation to facilitate liquidations if necessary. On E-mode, only AVAX can be borrowed against sAVAX, which is a highly correlated asset with healthy liquidity on DEXs.

**Maturing Asset**: The cap was initially set as it was a deployment of a new pool. sAVAX has been listed for more than 2 weeks (listed 30th June 2022) and has been near supply cap since. As an asset, sAVAX is relatively mature, having launched in February 2022 and having undergone tumultuous market conditions and stress testing.

At its peak, there were over 4.27m AVAX staked within the BENQI protocol, with users claiming over 2.05m AVAX (> 46%) from the protocol on multiple occasions within days as documented by DefiLlama (https://defillama.com/protocol/benqi-staked-avax?denomination=AVAX).

488,"#### ABSTRACT

The DAO relies on two main systems that dictate and govern the entire DAO. Snapshot & Discourse. However, newcomers to the DAO may not be familiar with these systems, and the lack of instructional material available to them, such as video content, infographics, or live training, can lead to confusion, inactivity, and low participation (the ApeCoin DAO may be their first ever interaction with a DAO). This leaves new DAO members on their own to find their way around. This AIP aims to provide a central, easy to understand source of information for new members to use as a reference. Getting new members of the DAO up to speed and answering basic questions on day one will benefit the DAO across the board.

489,"[ARC] - UI/UX upgrade governance framework
The Aave protocol is a decentralized ecosystem of smart-contracts running on several EVM networks. This ecosystem is permisionless and anyone with the required tech knowledge can freely use 100% of the Aave protocol features.

That being said, for a more accessible user experience, the Aave companies created the Aave application 4 allowing the interaction with the Aave protocol without technical knowledge.

To reinforce the decentralization of the application, the Aave app is deployed on IFPS and considering Flux hosting to avoid centralization of hosting,

also, the Aave app, is fully open source 1 and allows any developer to contribute to the improvement of the application for the benefit of the end-users.

As recently, we have witnessed multiple demands from third-parties to be integrated in the aave App (wallets, on-ramps etc…) The presented framework intends to provide governance guidelines to standardize the process of integration into the Aave App.

This framework is intended to provide standardization of UI/UX integration of the Aave App.

The proposed governance process for a UI integration is to have each entity do a governance thread open for at least 5 days.

Then open a snapshot vote with a starting voting period of 24h in the future with at least 3 days open vote period considered valid with a 100k AAVE YAE vote quorum.

the proposed options for the snapshot must be YAE/NAY/ABSTAIN.

The Aave interface GitHub maintainers will then review the integration PR and provided they don’t detect security issues, will merge the PR.

In the case of a security issue detected with the PR and not discussed before the snapshot vote, the GitHub maintainers will open technical communication channels with the entity in an effort to allow the integration to be merged but will keep a veto right regardless of the governance process in the case the integration is considered harmful to Aave users security.",bullish

### Summary

DAOhaus proposes to add a veBAL guage for the [HAUS/WETH 80/20 pool] `https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x17ddd9646a69c9445cd8a9f921d4cd93bf50d108000200000000000000000159)`

### Protocol Description

[$HAUS]`https://daohaus.club/token` is the governance token for DAOhaus.

DAOhaus is a home for purpose-driven community DAOs. The DAOhaus platform is a human-friendly interface for communities to collectively deploy and manage [Moloch DAOs] `https:// medium.com/raid-guild/moloch-evolved-v2-primer-25c9cdeab455` Over 2,000 DAOs have been summoned on the DAOhaus platform to date, with over 10,000 individual DAO members and millions of dollars worth of crypto assets secured in DAO treasuries.

#### Governance: UberHaus and Warcamp

DAOhaus is governed by [UberHaus]`https://uberhaus.club/`, a DAO whose members are themselves DAOs that use the DAOhaus platform. UberHaus’ powers include governing the non-circulating $HAUS supply.

Uberhaus delegates (appointed by each DAO according to their own processes) meet weekly to discuss Uberhaus business. Proposals are made with a 4 day voting period and a 14 day ""grace period"" during which member DAOs can exercise their right to  ""ragequit"", i.e., exit the DAO with their full share of the treasury. This credible threat of exit creates a robust balance of power within the DAO and incentivizes seeking consensus whenever possible.

UberHaus funds one of its member DAOs – Warcamp – to build, maintain, and promote the DAOhaus platform. All core contributors to DAOhaus are members of, and receive compensation from, the Warcamp DAO. Warcamp members are admins of the DAOhaus Github repos.

##### Relevant links:

* The [UberHaus DAO]`https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0x4bec8e49aa44bb520bd5e29d6358e22464b5eb68` (on Gnosis Chain), which includes the main treasury and non-circulating $HAUS supply
* The [Warcamp DAO]`https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xef3d8c4fbb1860fceab16595db7e650cd5ad51c1` (on Gnosis Chain)
* The [UberHaus delegate multisig]`https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x648DfEBbaf3638cDa047141dbF4AF3006e880f49` (on Ethereum; 6 of 11), via which a set of delegates from UberHaus and Warcamp manage UberHaus’ assets on Ethereum. Those assets include a portion of the HAUS/WETH Balancer pool liquidity.

#### $HAUS Price History

The majority of the $HAUS price history is viewable [on Coingecko]`https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/daohaus`.

March 29, 2021, was the first time there was publicly available $HAUS liquidity. The initial price at that point was $8.88. There was an immediate runup just prior to Coingecko beginning to track the price.

### Motivation

The [HAUS/WETH 80/20 pool]`https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x17ddd9646a69c9445cd8a9f921d4cd93bf50d108000200000000000000000159` needs incentivization to help maintain and deepen its liquidity, which would have a number of important benefits, including the following.

* Enabling easier access to $HAUS for DAOs and individuals wishing to participate in DAOhaus governance activities
* Facilitating DAOhaus ecosystem grants denominated in $HAUS (by increasing the relative stability of the $HAUS price)
* Facilitating upcoming utilization of $HAUS as a coordination mechanism (beyond voting) within the DAOhaus ecosystem (also related to price stability)
* Supporting the utility and value of DAOhaus contributor compensation denominated in $HAUS

### Specifications

#### Governance:

See Governance section under Protocol Description above.

#### Oracles:

The DAOhaus platform does not rely on any external oracles.

#### Audits:

The most used smart contracts in the DAOhaus platform are instances of the [MolochV2.1 contract framework]`https://github.com/HausDAO/Molochv2.1`. V2.1 makes only a small adjustment to the [V2 contract]`https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch`, which was audited by Consenys Diligence.

None of the contracts used within the DAOhaus platform are upgradable.

DAOhaus also makes use of Minion contracts, which allow a DAO to interact with external contracts and control external vaults. The predominant version is the [Safe Minion contract]`https://github.com/HausDAO/MinionSummonerV2`, which acts as middleware between the DAO contract and a Gnosis Safe, where all the funds are stored and external contract interactions are executed.

There have been no hacks of DAOhaus smart contracts to date.

DAOhaus takes decentralization seriously and has made several organizational design choices to avoid concentrating power. As a result, the current state of DAOhaus is reasonably decentralized:

* None of the DAOhaus contracts are upgradable.
* Governance power over key on-chain assets is distributed across multiple entities, each of which is a DAO of its own. For example, DAOhaus core contributors (Warcamp) is a 30-person DAO with distributed governance powers.
* Non-circulating $HAUS is controlled by UberHaus, the DAO of DAOs. No DAO in UberHaus controls more than 10.5% of voting shares, and there is no path by which a DAO could gain additional voting shares without permission from a majority of peer DAOs.

The largest centralization vector is our front end hosting, over which a handful of developers have admin control. However, while an attack on the front end could manipulate what users see, the on-chain contracts (readable and writable via block explorers) remain the source of truth for all key user assets.

Our goal is to migrate our entire stack to decentralized infrastructure.

#### Market History:

The pool has been active since March 8, 2022.

* Current TVL: $2.1M
* Historical volume: $248k

497,"Symmetric as the official friendly fork of Balancer on Celo

This proposal aims to expand the Balancer ecosystem to Celo, managed by Symmetric,and make Symmetric the official Friendly Fork of Balancer on Celo.

Background:

Symmetric is a fork of Balancer that currently runs on the Celo and Gnosis Network, and will soft launch on Kava imminently. The project launched in 2021 and has since deployed a V1 and V2 fork of Balancer on both networks in addition to graduating from Celo Camp. Symmetric has close ties to the Celo community and looks to play a large part in Celo’s mission-based activity moving forward.

Symmetric approached BalancerDAO before launching V2, which did not result in an agreement. Symmetric has since shipped and operated their V2 on Gnosis and Celo in July, while BalancerDAO introduced the veBAL tokenomics, launched on Optimism in collaboration with Beethoven, and the bLabs team added a deployment to Gnosis to their roadmap.

Based on these changes, we think it’s the right moment to re-engage and find a mutually beneficial outcome.

Motivation

The Celo Ecosystem, despite relatively low usage, is seeing an increase in interest as the ReFi space native to the chain is growing fast, with projects such as Toucan protocol moving onto Celo recently. Another example is Uniswap moving to Celo with a $10M incentive package from the Celo Foundation’s DeFi for the People initiative focusing on Green Assets. Another significant point is that PrimeDAO is launching a ReFi Launchpad program on Celo in Q4 with $1M in funds available for project launches and liquidity rewards (bribes).

We believe we have the right knowledge, skillset, and network to successfully expand the Balancer protocol onto the Celo network and become one of the top three DEXs on Celo by the end of 2023.

Specifications

Friendly Fork Status

If this vote successfully passes, the Celo deployment of Symmetric will be recognized as the official friendly fork of Balancer on Celo.

SYMM token distribution mechanism

Symmetric plans on developing a system similar to veBAL by which SYMM token distribution is optimized and decentralized through holding of SYMM’s core pool on Celo (SYMM-CUSD) and voting via a simple gauge.

Tokens to become a FF

SymmetricDAO proposes distributing SYMM tokens to BalancerDAO and Balancer Stakeholders to become a Friendly Fork. In exchange for becoming the Friendly Fork on Celo, SymmetricDAO will distribute ~2.5% (12,500 SYMM) of the tokens to BalancerDAO and ~1% (5000 SYMM) to veBAL holders that engage with the deployment by December 31, 2022.",bullish

title: ARC: Extend the Safety Module Protection to Aave V2 Arc
status: WIP
author: Governance House, @MatthewGraham @ncitron, 3SE Holding & uhom 
created: 25/07/2022

---

# Simple Summary

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module (SM) protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested.

# Abstract

The Safety Module is a $700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users. It’s a unique mechanism within DeFi, that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users. At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market. As a result, not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection.

As new markets hold more risk at launch, they are initially excluded from the SM protection. Today, most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO, they seem fit for SM protection.

# Motivation

The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi. This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market. As new markets hold additional risk, these are not initially protected by the SM. However, once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months, the risks are significantly lower. Furthermore, the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process, with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2.

Overall, these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market, holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market. This implies that, in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market, the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market. Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks, as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers.

Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers (lps) on these markets. By reducing the risk for lps, it is expected to lead to further growth of the market’s TVL overtime. Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets, lps are treated more equally across the markets.

The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets. In the case of Aave markets on other chains, the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure, and not failures caused by the chains themselves (Polygon/Avax). With regards to the Aave Arc Market, Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAO’s stated risk parameters, should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update, the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance.

These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem. In particular, the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive. Today, most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon, while just about 100k on Ethereum V2. These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections, in a shorter time period.

# Specification

The table below shows the Aave V2 markets, assets listed and ecosystem collections for the Aave DAO.

501,"##### ABSTRACT
The purpose of this proposal is to outline the framework for a voluntary, no-cost three-month pilot program aimed at pairing successful AIP authors with first-time (AIP) applicants to foster increased participation and enhance the overall quality of proposals submitted for voting.

AllCityBAYC will oversee the initiative independently, separate from the Governance Working Group, with the intention of presenting a proof-of-concept to the ApeCoinDAO community for further development once completed.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
1. Improve the quality of ApeCoinDAO grant proposals: The AIP Ambassador & Mentorship Program will refine grant proposals submitted to ApeCoinDAO, making them more structured, detailed, and in line with DAO goals.
2. Increase the success rate of ApeCoinDAO grant proposals: With programs like this, ApeCoinDAO can increase the amount of meaningful proposals being passed, leading to a more effective grant process and overall positive impact on our ecosystem.
3. Knowledge transfer and skill development: Mentors and mentorship programs pour the foundation for success and reduce learning curves.
4. Reduced barriers: The AIP Ambassador & Mentorship Program will eliminate or reduce barriers that obstruct individuals or groups from accessing opportunities, resources, or participating in the AIP grant proposal process stemming from a lack of ecosystem understanding or ineffective communication skills.
5. Community building: This program will develop a deeper sense of belonging, connection, and cooperation among ApeCoinDAO constituents and provide an inviting environment for newcomers who may be curious about writing AIPs.
6. Establish ApeCoinDAO as a recognized incubator for innovation: Developing ApeCoinDAO as a visible hub known for assisting community members foster innovative ideas will encourage creativity within the community, increase brand recognition and contribute to an overall strengthened reputation.

503,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z consumers via extremely popular and influential social media personalities on Instagram, Tik Tok, and Youtuber. The goal is to create awareness within the normies and introduce them to the Bored Ape Yacht Club as the best club in the world despite not having a club or any yachts, and that ApeCoin is the future of finance that will lead to financial freedom despite not having any utility or real world use cases.

By Achieving this goal we hope to increase demand for Apes and get hundreds or maybe even thousands of normies to come buy our bags. If we can convince them into truly believing that Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin are cool, we hope they will buy them to be a part of this great community with no interest of ever selling for a profit, resulting in an increased holder count. This can potentially get Apes out of the hands of Blur farmers and traders who only buy Apes to flip them for a 0.01 eth profit (or loss).
MAGA - Make Apes Great Again

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Increased holder count… This may or may not bring in a few thousand new ApeCoin bag holders.
New community members and DAO participants… We may or may not get a few thousand new plebs to complain about how down bad they are.

More hate and ridicule… We may get a bunch of people to make fun of and talk bad about Apes. But there’s no such thing as bad publicity right? Whether the things they say are good or bad they will be talking about us.

The idea is to convince the normies that Apes are cool and they need to be like us. To make them realize that the Bored Ape Yacht Club is the best club in the world and they need to join this club asap before they can no longer afford to join.

The only way to find out if it works is to FAFO. The more we FA, the more we FO. If we don’t FA, we’ll never FO.

The one benefit I can guarantee for sure is that 1000 community members will get to claim a free Twisted Ape Treasure Chest. I have 1000 of these Treasure Chests in stock and ready to ship. They are currently priced at 69 $APE, but if this AIP is approved, I will make them a free claim to the first 1000 wallets that vote on this AIP, regardless whether they vote yes or no.

We will also include delegated voters. If you delegate your votes to another wallet or are part of a sub community that votes separately such as Surreal or Mocaverse, our dev team will get all your wallet addresses from the snapshot and include you in the free claim.

I will post the winners of these Chests here on the forum as well as on X and Discord. I will ensure everyone finds out about it by making public announcements on as many Twitter spaces as I can get on. We will not request any personal information directly, however the claim will be made on our Shopify website with the standard checkout process similar to every other ecommerce store on Shopify. So mailing addresses will be as safe as they usually are as with any other order users place online.

If there are less than 1000 voters and delegates and we have some leftover Treasure Chests, then we will make them available for free to all ApeCoin holders via a random raffle system.

title: [ARFC] Add wstETH to Optimism Aave v3
Discussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-wsteth-to-aave-v3-on-optimism/10932
short description: Add wstETH to Optimism Aave v3 deployment as collateral with borrowing enabled. Create an Ethereum eMode.
author: Llama - Defi_Consulting
dated: 2023-01-29

---

# Summary

This ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add wstETH to the Optimism V3 Liquidity Pool.

# Abstract

Across the Aave Liquidity Pools, stETH is listed on Aave v2 Ethereum and wstETH is listed on Aave v3 Ethereum. This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Optimism Liquidity Pool as Collateral with Borrowing enabled.  

The stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aave’s revenue, more than $281k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Optimism users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave.
 
The risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Llama, with this post using the parameters agreed between the two service providers.

# Motivation

The stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.55B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.83B) and ETH ($1.42B). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. 

Demand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Optimism Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Optimism. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aave’s revenue.

The charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $217k in revenue during December and has already generated $281k by late January.

Listing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Optimism, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.

### Motivation

Development of cross chain gauge boosts in collaboration with Layer Zero has progressed significantly and the new L2 gauges are ready to be used. Every existing gauge on a network other than Ethereum will either be migrated to a new gauge that supports cross chain boosts or killed. Balancer’s UI will feature the ability for veBAL lockers to sync their veBAL balance to non-ethereum networks to take advantage of boosted BAL emissions - this is expected over the next one or two months.

There will be two groups of transactions - group A will add the new gauges to the system and be executed immediately. Group B will kill the old gauges and be executed approximately on May 9th. This is to allow time for the next Aura voting cycle to complete to ensure any protocols providing voting incentives get the full value of those incentives. For those new gauges which get veBAL votes before May 4th the first emissions through the new gauges would start on May 11th.

Also on May 11th Balancer’s UI will display informational warning messages on all L2 pools which are getting a new gauge - this will provide a one click “gauge migration” for LP’s, meaning unstaking from the old gauge and re-staking in the new one.

### Specification
#### Group A
#1
The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction to the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling grantRole with the following arguments:

role: `0xf49d7ffb5922642adc9f29cfb52b2214e81e0b0e54e9cd1e9f70439f0011f368`

This corresponds with the role for calling add_gauge on the gaugeController.

account: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`

This allows the DAO Multisig to directly add gauges to the controller.

#2
The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptor at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call performAction with the GaugeController at `0xC128468b7Ce63eA702C1f104D55A2566b13D3ABD` for the target(address) argument and using `0x3a04f900` followed by the gauge addresses listed below and the corresponding gauge type for the data(bytes) argument.

# Summary

This publication proposes updating Aave DAO's stable coin holdings in preparation for the emergence of several service provider proposals. Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.

# Motivation

The below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)

The is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.

In the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:

* Security (Certora, Sigma)
* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) 
* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))
* Marketing (Aave Companies)
* Delegates (6 teams)
* Liquidity Committee (GLC)

Assuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.

The GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.

The previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:

* $375k ACI (6 months)
* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)
* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)
* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)

Total: $1,721k GHO

The DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.

This proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.

The DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).

However, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.

## Security Service Providers

Aave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.

* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)
* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)
* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)

This proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. 

For the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.

## Bug Bounty Program

The Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.

## Risk Service Providers

During 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.

Based upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.

## Voting Service Providers

The current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.

We note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.

## Financial Service Providers

A budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. 

** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**

## Marketing Service Provider

Currently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.

## GHO Liquidity Committee

The GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.

$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. 

## Growth Service Provider

The ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.

## Development Service Provider

The @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.

## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider

The AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.

## Safety Module

Expenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.

## Funding

Over the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:

* $1.5M - Security (6 months)
* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)
* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)
* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)
* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)
* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)

Total: 5.1M USD

All Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. 

Risk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.

There is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.

The ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.

An additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.

Additional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.

# Specification

This proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:

* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI
* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)
* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)

Swap the following asset holdings to GHO:

* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)
* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)
* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)
* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)
* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)

Bridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:

* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury
* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury
* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury

The USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:

* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3
* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3
* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3
* Swap 700k USDC to GHO

Upon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:

* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)
* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)
* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)
* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)

The above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. 

# Next Steps

The tBTC team proposes adding a tBTC/wBTC or tBTC/[renBTC/sBTC/wBTC] pool. Adding a tBTC pool will further increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum and make it easier to swap between assets.

Abstract

tBTC is a Bitcoin sidechain on Ethereum, built to give Bitcoin the capabilities of Ethereum and bring additional collateral to DeFi. The asset (TBTC) is an ERC-20 pegged to Bitcoin, it can be minted or redeemed for BTC by anyone and without intermediaries. Instead of relying on a single custodian like wBTC or federation of custodians like Liquid, tBTC is supported by a decentralized bonded multi-federated peg model using ECDSA technology.

tBTC is built on the Keep Network, and as of launching this week already has 24.21M USD locked in the network (22.69M USD in KEEP, 1.39M USD in ETH and 0.26M USD in BTC). We’ve decided to launch slowly and safely with a 9 week graduated cap, currently the cap is at 100 BTC but will rise to 250 later this week. [See the full schedule here](https://blog.keep.network/tbtc-the-safe-way-to-use-bitcoin-in-defi-is-live-on-tbtc-network-de2bb8b6eaf7). Future plans for tBTC include pointing at least 5% of the KEEP supply at various liquidity rewards.

Motivation

With several BTC on Ethereum choices out there, the tBTC team wants to gauge the Curve community’s appetite for a tBTC pool. Our team’s initial thought was to keep it simple with a tBTC/wBTC pool, but are also interested in hearing about interest in something like a tBTC/[renBTC/wBTC/sBTC] pool.

Please vote below or submit options for other assets you’d like to see in a pool.

Specification

The tBTC contracts just went live: https://etherscan.io/token/0x8dAEBADE922dF735c38C80C7eBD708Af50815fAa

tBTC is fully open source and has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence, Sergei Delgado (an independent BTC researcher) and Trail of Bits. [See audit details](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc#security)

515,"This would add a ""Claim to veCRV"" option when claiming CRV from Mintr.

Many jurisdictions, including the US, treat receipt of CRV from staking pool tokens as a taxable event (income). By allowing users to directly lock, this is avoided, and the net profitability of staking is higher for all impacted LPs. This should lead to more locked up CRV, less sell pressure on CRV, and merriment and good times for all.

This would improve quality of life for many users and should prove supporting of the CRV token price. It enables giving less money to Uncle Sam and his friends. Gas and time would be saved in the standard claim to vote-lock flow.

In terms of implementation, I think a checkbox next to the claim button is simplest, but I defer to the eng team on what aligns with their UI/UX look and feel.

### [BIP-343](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/303)

## Background
On the 24th of June 2023, the [Balancer Emergency SubDAO](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/governance/emergency.html#emergency-subdao), put all Composable Stable Pools (CSPs) into [Recovery Mode](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-121-permission-granting-recovery-mode/4045).  This was in response to an incident reported by ImmuniFi that Balancer Labs was not able to immediately verify or discount.

Ongoing investigation is leading to the belief, which still must be verified, that many of the pools can run safely outside [Recovery Mode](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-121-permission-granting-recovery-mode/4045).  The Emergency DAO has requested that we grant rights to disableRecoveryMode() on all CSPs and all Weighted Pools version 2 and above.

This will allow them to unpause pools as it becomes sensible, without a 1-2 week governance delay.

### TL;DR on recovery mode:
- Pools in Recovery Mode do not collect protocol fees(and therefore do not accumulate core pools incentives)
- Pools in Recovery Mode can only be joined and exited proportionally.
- Recovery Mode may interfere with the compatibility of pools.

## Risk Assessment
This BIP could allow the EmergencyDAO to remove pools from recovery mode without engaging governance or communicating the change.  Voting on this BIP accepts that those who put a pool into Recovery Mode can also move it out without governance intervention.

521,"Hi everyone,

As most of you are aware, the Tribe DAO has [applied for a veBAL allowlisting last month](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allow-tribe-dao-to-lock-vebal/2888), that was granted by the Balancer DAO, and 112,041 B-80BAL-20WETH tokens were successfully locked into veBAL last month.

The Tribe DAO also owns 252,865 B-70WETH-30FEI BPTs, a pool token that has a gauge, and we staked the BPTs in the gauge, earning BAL for around 3 weeks.

Contract used for vote-locking and gauge staking :

https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4EAc760C2C631eE0b064E39888b89158ff808B2

During our periodic reward harvesting 2 weeks ago, we noticed that our contract could not claim the BAL rewards associated with gauge staking, only the BAL and bb-a-USD associated with veBAL holding.

After discussion with the Balancer team, the issue was identified : BAL is not distributed through the gauge system, but through a BalancerMinter contract that is connected to the gauge system. The Tribe devs did a mistake, as we wanted to re-use the voting escrow and gauge management contracts we used for Angle Protocol, but it turns out that Angle Protocol distributes their ANGLE differently, directly through the gauges and not through a minter (like Curve and Balancer), so we did not have any capability to interact with the BalancerMinter. We tested and successfully claimed empty rewards on the gauge without revert, but just assumed no BAL were distributed because the gauge weight of the FEI pool was zero.

The Tribe DAO’s vote-locker has been deployed as an immutable contract, and it is now impossible to add the capability to interact with the BalancerMinter and claim the BAL rewards associated with gauge-staked BPTs.

As a result, the Tribe DAO farmed 34,344 BAL that will be forever unclaimable on the BalancerMinter.

We would like to ask the Balancer DAO to OTC these BAL tokens back to us (on [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5bb8F0253776beC6FF450c2B40f092f7e7f5b57)). We do realize that there is absolutely no obligation to do so on your part, and that the mistake was ours, but Balancer is a very strategic move for the Tribe DAO (even more so with the [FEI<>FRAX partnership](https://tribe.fei.money/t/frax-x-fei-stablecoin-alliance/4292) potentially coming), and these BAL will never enter circulation and will forever be unclaimable otherwise. The Tribe DAO will continue to renew its veBAL locking from the current contract, but we are going to deploy a new gauge staking contract [shortly](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/pull/799) (edit - deployed [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf53e251352683155898295569d77b8506ba00d80) behind [eip-1967](https://etherscan.io/address/0x66977ce30049cd0e443216bf26377966c3a109e2) proxy).

**Title:** [ARFC] Onboarding of weETH to Aave v3 on Ethereum
**Author:** Ether.fi & ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-02-27

---
### **Summary:**

The current ARFC seeks to add [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) Liquid Restaking Token weETH to Aave V3 Ethereum, after the successful [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboarding-weeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/16546) and [TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xffe122a2fb0b34e713b7bb8e74e943b35c6cb298bafc4e50c464b62167e3246e).

The intention behind this initiative is to enhance the diversity of assets on Aave and bolster liquidity within the ecosystem.

### Motivation:

eETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer. As of February 3rd, approximately 290,310 ETH ($670M) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi 1](http://ether.fi/) protocol, and XX has been natively restaked in EigenLayer.

[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) stands as the pioneering decentralized and non-custodial delegated staking protocol featuring an LRT (eETH). A notable feature of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is the control it provides stakers over their keys. The team behind the protocol is guided by the following principles:

1. Decentralization is the foremost objective. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is unwavering in its commitment to maintain the protocol's non-custodial and decentralized nature, ensuring that stakers always have control over their ETH.
2. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) operates as a legitimate business with a sustainable revenue model, with the team dedicated to its long-term success. There is no place for deceptive or unsustainable financial practices.
3. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is committed to always acting in the best interest of the Ethereum community. In the event of any missteps, the team at [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) will take responsibility and swiftly rectify the situation.

Risks:

[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)’s LRT eETH is 100% redeemable. Users who deposit ETH into the protocol can withdraw their stake at any time. The holdings are publicly auditable on-chain and the protocol retains healthy reserves to offset any losses.

## Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:

Anyone who deposits weETH into Aave will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)  and EigenLayer points to be used for future incentives.

Users are given eETH on a 1:1 basis with a minimum deposit of 0.001 ETH. 

[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity (weETH) to various platforms.

528,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BSC etc.

531,"#### ABSTRACT

A community marketplace is a natural next step for the ApeCoin DAO. A successful community marketplace will: drive adoption of $APE through $APE listings, drive traffic to the ApeCoin DAO (apecoin.com), and decrease fees to community members by building a APE-native marketplace with rich ape-specific user experiences. In order to compete this marketplace must be cost competitive with fees in-line with or lower than competitors like X2Y2.

Our marketplace will host all Yugaverse projects in a single marketplace UI, with dramatically reduced fees, keeping $$ in the BAYC ecosystem and improving the marketplace experience for both buyers and sellers.

While we have a lot to share, some notable key features of the marketplace are the following:

- Leveraging @reservoir0x’s open-source, on-chain orderbook to increase openness and composability.
- Aggregated orders from major marketplaces (OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, Sudoswap, and more) to maintain a strong bridge to the rest of the NFT market.
- Native sales in $APE with no fees to users buying and selling in $APE.
- A .5% marketplace fee on $ETH listings and a .25% fee in $APE. .25% of all fees will be sent to a community-held multi-sig wallet on a monthly cadence. The use of funds can then be decided in a separate AIP. (more on why later) The .25% from $ETH will be converted to $APE and sent to the wallet.
- Development of contextual and ape-specific marketplace functionality, such as integration of key BAYC metadata, relation to the Otherside, and more.

1. We can help setup a website which ApeCoin can host on their subdomain to display contributor stats (ex: https://optimism.showkarma.xyz). Some of the features are
2. Display high level voting summary
3. Display voting history from Snapshot/on-chain
4. Display delegate commitment message
5. Display delegate voting reason for each proposal
6. Delegate tokens right from the dashboard
7. Install discourse forum plugin that has the following features
8. Display governance stats of forum users (ex: see governance stats here “https://discuss.ens.domains/u/nick.eth/summary”
9. A custom form in the forum that delegates can use to post commitment message which gets posted in the forum and also displayed in the dashboard (bullet 1 above)
10. A custom form in the forum that delegates can use to post reasons for how they voted on each proposal which gets posted to form and also displayed in dashboard

#### OVERALL COST

$10,000 to cover dev cost for customizing dashboard, setup plugin and ongoing infrastructure and maintenance. We are also open to the option of doing all the work upfront and only if the community finds our product valuable, you can release the funds.

**Summary:**

> This pool uses the ComposableStablePoolFactory-v3 1 which addresses the [reentrancy vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345) disclosed during February 2023. This gauge is uncapped, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329). This means 65% of 50% of yield generated by this pool is to be used for bribing for votes on it via [Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/balancer). The remaining 35% goes to Balancer DAO as revenue. 
> 
> This proposal is for a new pool OHM / bb-a-wETH to be created on Ethereum.

> * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OlympusDAO)

**Protocol Description:**

> Olympus is a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain with the goal of establishing OHM as a crypto-native reserve currency. It conducts autonomous and dynamic monetary policy, with market operations supported by the protocol-owned Olympus Treasury.
> 
> OHM serves a need in the market gap between fiat stablecoins and volatile crypto assets, providing relative stability and scalability underpinned by the protocol’s Range Bound Stability (“RBS”) system. RBS is the flagship system of Olympus’ autonomous monetary policy and has resulted in [low volatility and stability](https://dune.com/spoysp/ohm-volatility) for OHM since its launch.

**Motivation:**

> Olympus currently has multiple large pools on Balancer, most notably the OHM/ETH and OHM/DAI pools on Ethereum. Creating an Olypus and Aave Boosted pool will generate more revenue for Balancer and with the core pool status, the pool will benefit from the Protocol Fee Incentive Vote flywheel.
> 
> With a large pool the flywheel is expected to generate a meaningful amount of vote incentive cash flow and this frees up Olympus's budget for bootstrapping other pools. 

**Specifications:**

> 1. **Governance:** 
> * OlympusDAO is currently using [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/olympusdao.eth) for governance
> * DAO [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x245cc372C84B3645Bf0Ffe6538620B04a217988B) 4 of 8: Holds DAO funds, executes governance proposals
> * Policy [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0cf30dc0d48604A301dF8010cdc028C055336b2E) 3 of 5: Changes to policy (reward rate adjustments, turn on/off bond markets)
> 
> 2. **Oracles:**  
> * The core protocol uses the Chainlink OHM oracle to record the OHM moving average price on chain for RBS operations,[linked here](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/overview/range-bound)).
> * Other core protocol functions do not require oracles.
> * The newly launched liquidity vault product uses oracles in order to prevent attack vectors in which deposits/withdrawals of a pool would result in highly skewed pool prices in comparison to the oracle price.

540,"# Motivation

Balancer recently [launched](https://op.beets.fi/#/pools) on Optimism in collaboration with BeethovenX. This deployment will soon utilize veBAL gauges for BAL emissions so it is important that BAL maintains adequate liquidity and price equivalence with Ethereum. To get around the 7 day withdrawal period on the official Optimism bridge which breaks the necessary arbitrage loop with Ethereum I have enlisted the help of [Multichain](https://multichain.xyz/). They have added support for BAL between Ethereum and Optimism, however [it requires liquidity to be functional](https://docs.multichain.org/for-partners/for-partners/faq).

Thus, I propose allocating BAL from the treasury for this purpose. Please see the poll at the bottom which will serve as a temp check on the amount. Note that we would earn [bridge fees](https://medium.com/multichainorg/anyswap-fees-explained-bceddf535b83) on any funds deposited for bridge liquidity.

The treasury [currently holds ~4M BAL](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f/balances) so you can calculate the impact to the treasury from there depending on your poll choice.

# Risk

* Multichain is exploited and our BAL is lost. You can find information about [their security model here](https://docs.multichain.org/getting-started/security/security-model).

# Introduction

Earlier this year, governance has approved to [deploy Balancer on Avalanche](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xfac459b1f0ce7eec8965814a062a3eac195b5988990ae7a6a59e4022304837c3)

After a bootstrapping phase where [an initial set of gauges was added](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x6459a7430d378236892af46e14afbecb56f51a81cd8e48b92e8a5774a919d7d6) the deployment is now at a much more mature state with approximately $7mln in TVL and $400k in daily trading volume. Furthermore, BAL emissions are flowing to major AVAX LST pools that are also part of our core pool framework. However, currently, no deep liquidity exists for BAL to trade with on Avalanche.

# Motivation

Given the lack of BAL liquidity on Avalanche, we propose to seed $100k in BAL/WAVAX liquidity in a 80:20 [pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/avalanche/pool/0xa39d8651689c8b6e5a9e0aa4362629aef2c58f55000200000000000000000038) on Avalanche so that protocol participants can trade against a core pair. This liquidity will be provisioned from the DAO treasury on mainnet. Funds will be bridged to Avalanche and deposited to a newly created BAL:WAVAX 80:20 pool.

At the time of the writing of this proposal, approximately $5k worth of BAL is emitted every day on Avalanche gauges. Therefore, a base liquidity of at least $100k is sufficient to provide a solid trading pair without too much slippage.This core liquidity pool will help participants to trade against WAVAX and therefore reduce friction of non-existent BAL liquidity. This measure should therefore improve UX for LPs and autocompounders significantly.

Examples of provisioning of 80:20 pools for other assets like Aura showed success on deployments like OP: https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x2f6b6973f38381fe453ea819b7e0f0897adeaae7000200000000000000000113

# Risk Assessment

Following risks may arise when provisioning liquidity on AVAX:

* Incurring losses while trading or provisioning liquidity
* Incurring impermanent loss by providing BAL against a non-ETH related asset like AVAX.

Incurring losses while trading or provisioning liquidity

As the DAO doesn’t hold any WAVAX liquidity, it needs to trade it on the open market. We suggest that USDC shall be traded by the LM Multi-sig on Avax that will use aggregators like 1inch to facilitate the trade and reduce price impact from trading USDC to WAVAX. The final BPT position shall then be transferred to the multi-sig to complete the transactions

Incurring impermanent loss by providing BAL against a non-ETH related asset like AVAX

One of Balancer’s core strengths is to provision a 80:20 pool to reduce IL. To demonstrate,

we can sketch out certain extreme scenarios where AVAX price would appreciate much more compared to BAL price. In such a scenario, we would incur so called impermanent loss on our position which describes the loss of value of the underlying assets in the pool compared to when the assets were simply held. We can use a tool like our IL calculator https://balancer.tools/impermanentLoss to simulate following scenario:

|Token|Price start|Price End|Difference (%)|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|BAL|4|6|50|
|AVAX|35|100|185|

Given this scenario for an investment of $100k we would incur IL of approx 3.7%. It is safe to assume that this pool will get at least 5% of trading fee rewards, which would negate any impact of IL.

 
![bip-513.png](ipfs://bafkreibe7ajfhl4dp672rqmf6sbj47b6duxs3tc6uezx5udmc7ye7rxl3y)
    

We therefore conclude that IL always plays a role but should not affect any significant losses to the DAO in this configuration.

# Technical Specification

The Balancer DAO Treasury Multi-sig `0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f` will send 20,000 USDC and $80k USD worth of BAL (real amount at time of writing) to the Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` which will bridge the funds to the LM Multisig on AVAX: `0x326A7778DB9B741Cb2acA0DE07b9402C7685dAc6` using Stargate Finance bridge via WalletConnect.

After funds have arrived on Avalanche, the LM multi-sig on Avalanche will trade $20k USDC to WAVAX on 1inch.

A total of approx. $100k of BAL and WAVAX will be deposited into pool [0xa39d8651689c8b6e5a9e0aa4362629aef2c58f55](https://app.balancer.fi/#/avalanche/pool/0xa39d8651689c8b6e5a9e0aa4362629aef2c58f55000200000000000000000038)

**Introduction & Domains of Operation:**

After a three-month trial contract facilitated by Balancer Labs, the Balancer community [passed](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x686cfe15ffd35178814276eaff348b791bfd8fd1684e2731f222e9881df61279) [BIP-254](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-254-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao/4652) to fund Beethoven X DAO as an official Service Provider from May 1, 2023 - July 31, 2023.

Shortly after the ratification of BIP-254, Orb Co. [relinquished its responsibilities of all marketing-related work](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-april-2023-high-level-updates/4735) and has since [released all marketing personnel](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-updated-q2-budget-forecast-5-12-23/4775). These actions created a void wherein a critical service essential for the Balancer ecosystem ceased to exist almost overnight.

In order to ensure a smooth transition and mitigate any harm to the Balancer brand, Beethoven X contributors have activated significant resources to allow us to step in to fill the gap in the domain of marketing/content and are now running the marketing efforts at Balancer.

April 26: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-balancer-marketing-analysis/4705/14?u=jedirasta26
May 4: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/beethoven-x-marketing-update/4731?u=jedirasta26
May 19: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bi-weekly-marketing-update-beethoven-x/4797?u=jedirasta26

As our initial budget did not account for the significant amount of additional work we’ve undertaken over the course of the last month, this proposal seeks to amend BIP-254 in the following ways:

1. Increase funding for marketing/content-related efforts from $15k to $30k per month starting June 1.
2. In an attempt to answer community concerns around having service providers that are “too big,” we will split marketing and technical services into two distinct service provider proposals moving forward. Passage of this proposal would additionally remove the marketing budget from BIP-254.

**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**

Over the past 3 months, the marketing efforts to support Orb were focused on the following key areas:

* Developer Landing Page
* Content and Education
* Social Media Presence

However, in light of the transitions of the Orb marketing team, our efforts over the past month have shifted focus and have been put towards building a foundation to adequately fill the role previously occupied by Orb. To achieve this we have established the following:

* We have defined a strategy for content creation that is focused on highlighting current developments in the Balancer ecosystem.
* We are attending weekly meetings with [@Solarcurve](https://forum.balancer.fi/u/solarcurve) and Maxis to make sure that content is relevant and closely aligned with BD efforts.
* We have created a notion-based system to organize, develop, and schedule content coming out on social media channels and share with all relevant contributors.
* We established a baseline cadence for content coming out on Twitter.
* We have built a base layer of visual assets to support all of the content copy.
* We have begun to develop a distinctive voice/style to authentically represent the Balancer brand.
* We have been working closely with Balancer’s lead designer [@uxui](https://forum.balancer.fi/u/uxui) to develop an aesthetic for the Balancer brand/social media presence.
* We have connected with the Balancer community contributors to begin to define a working relationship, support their contributions and build a framework for future collaboration.
* We have continued to work on the developer landing page.
* We have furthered our relationship with Aura to closely align on the Balancer brand direction and over-arching marketing strategy.

Now that a baseline has been built, our focus moving forward is to showcase Balancer as a highly relevant and flourishing ecosystem. Leveraging our current expertise and familiarity with the ecosystem/tech alongside support from key contributors from the Balancer DAO we aim to achieve this by working on 4 key areas:

1. Social Media
2. Core Growth Pillars
3. Brand Development
4. Long-Term Initiatives

Below we have outlined the intention for these initiatives with relevant KPIs for their measurement/success.

1.Social Media: Twitter is the main point of visibility for the content coming through Balancer and as such it will remain a major priority for our marketing efforts. To continue to build relevancy for the Balancer brand and increase our reach we will be working on the following:

  * Consistent threads focused around the core growth pillars identified with BD.
  * Building rapport with key partners in the space to increase network effect.
  * Refining Balancer's visual style and tone of voice.
  * The inclusion of visual forms of educational content.
  * Community initiatives and a focus on increasing engagement.

KPIs: To measure growth across Twitter we will use the following metrics on a bi-monthly basis. Our hope is to see these figures trend upward over time.

 
![beetsM1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreig4ilgccqfynilp635t7m2ote2ng4ya4n7djlgnzxke7fekecgncm)
    


2.Core Growth Pillars: Re-establishing “relevancy” has been identified as an area that will be critical for the future growth of Balancer’s ecosystem. The following narratives have been outlined as highly relevant to Balancer's success:

  * ve8020
  * LST’s
  * Boosted Pools
  * Building on Balancer

With these core growth pillars identified, our goal is to curate content focused on bringing these pillars to the forefront of users' attention. We aim to achieve this in the following way:

* Focus marketing efforts around highlighting the vast benefits of the ve8020 model. Showcase successful case partner studies with statistics and growth metrics, as well as build out a ve8020 initiative pack to further educate, onboard, and align new participants.
* Continue to highlight the unique technology that sets Balancer apart for hosting and facilitating the growth of Liquid Staked Tokens.
* Showcase the power and effectiveness of Boosted Pools for facilitating ecosystem-wide growth.
* Provide content and material for builders to onboard into the Balancer ecosystem.

KPIs:

* Ve8020: With a push for the adoption of ve8020 we would like to see the number of protocols adopting this governance model increase over the rest of the quarter. Currently, 8 protocols have embraced the initiative, we would like to see this number increase to 15+ protocols by Q3.

* LST dominance: Since Shapella, we have seen LST liquidity on Ethereum rise week after week, with total ETH staked up over 4 million since April. Throughout the next quarter, we expect this to continue to increase with Liquid Staked protocols directly impacted by an influx of capital. With an innovative tech stack tailored to facilitate the growth of Liquid Staked liquidity, Balancer is uniquely positioned to become the dominant hub for these YB asset types. The goal is to see every LST hosted on Balancer increase in % by the start of Q3.

 
![beetsM2.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiapq5p773dkibw67p4uej63jr4bwiqsm2irnvblxcfxzitapkp34q)
    

* Building on Balancer: At the start of our service provider contract we had begun work on a developer-focused landing page. However, during the transition of Orb this project has seen less attention as our focus shifted to building a baseline for operations. With a baseline now in place, the goal for the next 3 months is to have completed a beta version of the Landing Page for the community to test out.

3.Brand Development: One of the major areas identified as having potential for improvement has been the overall design and UX for Balancer. Working closely with lead designer Pon, we have been exploring different avenues for how this could be achieved.

  Over the coming months, we hope to bring to life all of the conceptual work we have done by working on the following:

  * Curate and present to the community 2-3 refined brand aesthetics with UX/UI prototypes.
  * Build out the Balancer developer landing page integrating new brand aesthetic.
  * Incorporate new look and feel into Twitter and content-related efforts.

4.Long-Term Initiatives

Below we have outlined 2 long-term marketing goals.

1.Education (Balancer Media Hub)

The Balancer Media Hub aims to create a central hub dedicated to curating high-quality, engaging content for the Balancer ecosystem. Articles, Videos, and Podcasts, all on one site. With a tech stack uniquely positioned to educate users on a plethora of different DeFi topics, the Balancer Media Hub has the potential to onboard the next wave of DeFi participants. The primary motivations for the development of the media hub are to:

* Facilitate the widespread adoption of users into Balancer/DeFi
* Create a space where educational content is accessible, fun, and engaging.
* Continue to push the evolution of the Balancer marketing department
* Build a foundation for the community to contribute to the growth and education of Balancer.
* Make sure that we stay not only relevant but “ahead of the curve” moving into the future.

2.Community Development

We are strong believers in grassroots movements and want to encourage community contributions in our marketing efforts. Our aim would be to foster community content creators to contribute towards the larger efforts of education in DeFi. By incentivizing users with innovative financial gamification mechanisms, we could create an initiative that would provide a platform for community members to showcase content relevant to the ecosystem in the following ways:

* Serve as a space of development for engaged community members and a space of inspiration for aspiring members.
* Introduce structures of gamification that add to participation and interaction within our community dynamic.
* Provide a framework for engagement that would have an effect on both visibility and education.
* Create a network of trust which allows the community to thrive.
* Potentially integrate into the Balancer Media hub to help scale community contributions

**Deprioritization of PR and Live Events:**

This is an area that previously received a significant amount of resources from the Orb marketing team. While we value the potential upside this type of marketing can bring, we feel that the cost-benefit doesn’t justify the continuation of these efforts. For the time being, we have chosen to sunset these domains for our marketing strategy and will instead focus on the areas described above. This means that we will not be actively pursuing PR-related activity or officially organizing/attending live events as part of our service provider contributions.

**Length of Engagement & Budget:**

For the services described above, we are requesting an increase in the current funding outlined in BIP-254 for marketing-related efforts from $15k per month to $30k per month starting from June 1, 2023, until July 31, 2023.

As part of this proposal, we would also like to make a formal revision to BIP-254. Presently, we offer both technical and non-technical services to the Balancer ecosystem under one service provider proposal. If accepted by the Balancer community, the passing of this proposal would split our services into 2 distinctive proposals; one service provider contract for technical services and another for marketing services. Moving forward this would mean that we will always request marketing budget changes/renewals separately, and any complaints/objections for marketing services would be treated as separate issues from the technical services provided.

As these funds will be used to cover contributor salaries, we request that this amount be made available in a liquid form. If approved, $30,000 USDC or BAL equivalent would be sent to the below ETH address around the first of each month.

Title: [ARFC] Reduce Reserve Factor on wstETH 
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-24

---

# **Summary**
For further alignment with the upcoming Lido Alliance proposals, this proposal will reduce the reserve factor for wstETH to 5%. 

## **Motivation**

Aave and Lido have historically seen symbiotic growth, with stETH being one of the premier collaterals on Aave and leveraged staking being one of the most profitable use cases for both Aave DAO and Lido users.

As part of the recently passed [TEMP CHECK proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-deploy-a-lido-aave-v3-instance/17930) to create an isolated instance for wstETH borrowers, a number of other parameter changes were proposed to align Lido and Aave. 

This proposal implements the agreed reserve factor change for wstETH to 5%.

## **Specification**

On all networks, change wstETH Reserve Factor to 5%. 

## Disclaimer

The ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.

## Next Steps

1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.

The Balancer gauge space has become quite cluttered.  This BIP proposes to remove a number of gauges that have been around for a while but are not receiving any votes.   The purpose of this governance is not to remove a gauge that is in use by a DAO, but simply to clean up gauges that seem to be abandoned.  Any DAO managing one of the tokens in the gauges listed below is welcome to request it is removed from the list of gauges to be removed so long as there is a clear plan to either obtain vote weight to trigger emissions from it or promote significant volume in the near future. 

### Specification

This BIP recommends the the removal of gauges for the following pools, all of which have received 0 or very minimal voting in recent rounds, and also are not generating significant activity in the form of trading volume or fees. Note the accompanying gauge address for each pool.

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Acquire AURA 
author: @TokenLogic & @MarcZeller (ACI)
created: 2023-08-29

---

# Summary

This publication proposes Aave DAO acquire 443,674 AURA from Olympus DAO for 420,159.28 units of DAI.

# Motivation

Over the next few months the veBAL and vlAURA being used to support GHO pools will reduce as voters shift there focus away from GHO. The initial commit from the Aura Finance team was 400,000 units of vlAURA for an initial 3 month duration.

This proposal seeks to replace the support from Aura Finance by acquiring 443,674 units of AURA from Olympus DAO. Olympus DAO is reducing there AURA exposure due to change in the Olympus DAO roadmap which is detailed [here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3756-towards-a-fully-autonomous-olympus) and [her](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3967-tap29-aura-solicitation-to-bid).

Based upon the research presented in this [Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682), which details impact AIP-42 by Aura Finance, the most efficient way for Aave DAO to bootstrap GHO is via vlAURA relative to veBAL. 

Olympus DAO seeks payment in DAI, at an exchange rate of 0.9470 DAI per unit of AURA. The amount of AURA is 443,674 with a total cost to Aave DAO of 420,159.28 units of DAI. Aave DAO currently holds [2.873M](https://etherscan.io/token/0x028171bca77440897b824ca71d1c56cac55b68a3?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) units of aDAI on Aave v2.

**Olympus DAO is conducting an open forum auction over 3 day period, bids are placed relative to the spot price derived from the AURA/wETH pool on Balancer v2.

The USD price will be updated within this proposal progressively over the bidding period. Do note, Aave DAO's governance process duration exceeds that of Olympus DAO's which means Aave DAO's voting occurs afterwards and ultimately determines if/when the OTC swap will occur**

# Specification

This proposal will achieve the following:

* Redeem 420,159.28 units aDAI from Aave v2
* Exchange 420,159.28 units of DAI for 443,674 units of AURA with Olympus DAO

For reference, Olympus DAO AURA Holding Address: `0x245cc372C84B3645Bf0Ffe6538620B04a217988B`

The contract shall be developed in collaboration with @MarcZeller and deployed by the ACI team.

The collateral used on Frax Finance is split between an accepted collateral (e.g. ether) and Frax Finance’s governance token, FXS. The collateralization ratio for FRAX changes based on its price. - [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/pt-BR/prices/Frax?timestamp=1705682853673)

> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:

> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.

Set Borrow cap to 4.6 Million


Proposal: remove the borrow cap on the cCOMP market.

On last Wednesday’s Community Call (I tried and failed to record the call…next time) we discussed removing the cCOMP borrow cap of 100k COMP. The borrow cap was originally put into place to prohibit someone from using the market to borrow COMP, create a governance proposal, vote, and return the capital in seconds. After the upgrade to Governor Bravo and the installation of a review period, the governance process is significantly more cost-prohibitive for a borrower to obtain the necessary votes to meet the proposal threshold. As well, the review period gives users 48-hours to position their COMP holding for a vote, unlike Governor Alpha which used an instantaneous voting system. If a malicious user were to borrow the required COMP to meet the proposal threshold the community would have sufficient time to defeat their proposal.

Removing the borrow cap will help the COMP market develop. Trading firms (onchain and offchain) utilize money markets like Compound and Aave in their systems to borrow assets and particularly ones that are not abundant in supply in traditional borrow/lend services like BlockFi, Genesis, Nexo, and Celsius. It is helpful for everyone if spot and futures markets are efficient.

Next Steps: Changing the borrow cap does not require a traditional governance proposal since caps are controlled by the community multisig. The multisig holders follow the direction of the community. Below is a 7-day poll for removing the borrow cap on the cCOMP market. If you vote “YES” you think the borrow cap should be removed. If you vote “NO” you do not think the borrow cap should be removed. If the poll revolves to “YES” after the 7-day period the multisig holders will remove the borrow cap.",bullish
555,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-balancer-labs-to-emergency-pause/2399).

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable a multisig controlled by Balancer Labs team members to control the Boosted Pools emergency pause mechanism during its first 3 months.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) have an emergency pause period which is **hardcoded at 3 months** from the time the factories were deployed. During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. **Funds can always be withdrawn by users** , even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.

Since gathering 6/11 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also **authorizing a Balancer Labs controlled multisig to pause the system** . The [BLabs Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B) will be controlled by a handful of team members at Balancer Labs. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Governance Multisig nor the BLabs Multisig will have any pause power.

An important distinction between the pause mechanism in Boosted Pools and that of previous pool types and of the vault is that Boosted Pools are not supposed to be unpaused. In practice, after a pool is paused users should withdraw assets from the pool and a new pool should be deployed. In the event that the pause mechanism must be triggered, Balancer Labs will commit resources to draw attention from liquidity providers to the fact that they must withdraw their funds.

## Specification

The Balancer governance multisig on Ethereum Mainnet ( `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` ) would submit a transaction to the Authorizer ( `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` ) in order to grant the following roles to a Multisig controlled by Balancer Labs ( `0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B` ):

1. the ability to call the `setPaused` function on pools deployed from the `AaveLinearPool` factory ( `0xD7FAD3bd59D6477cbe1BE7f646F7f1BA25b230f8` )
2. the ability to call the `setPaused` function on pools deployed from the `StablePhantomPool` factory ( `0xb08E16cFc07C684dAA2f93C70323BAdb2A6CBFd2` )

The DZAR peg to ZAR (fiat currency) is kept at voluntary efforts of Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd. and the pegging can be terminated at any point in time at discretion of Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd.""

DZAR can print unlimited amounts of tokens at their sole discretion.

DZAR gets pooled in many 8 asset pools. These pools are as safe as the weakest currency, DZAR going to 0 will drain these pools to 0. There are millions in these pools. If DZAR prints unlimited amount of tokens, it will drain all these pools, generate large losses and bad publicity.

557,"Hello Cake holders,

I am a supporter of Cake emission reduction to fight inflation. For some months we have been reducing only the emissions of the Farms and not those of the Syrup Pools.

I'm against cutting only farms emission while keeping syrup pools emission at the same level. Farms constitute crucial part of PCS and each time they reduce Cake emission er are making them less attractive to the market.

To make the ecosystem more sustainable, I propose to the community to vote on the reduction of cake emission for the Cake Pool (stake cake earn cake), which is the Pool that increases Cake's inflation the most.

Even small reductions each time can help Cake and drive us towards inflation.

Title: [ARFC] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market 
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-26

---

# **Summary**
This proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. 

### **Motivation**

Artemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.

artMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).

artMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.

### Benefits of listing artMETIS

We believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.

- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.
- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.
- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.
- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.

### Chain to be deployed/listed

artMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.

Ticker: artMETIS

Contract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)

| Siloed Borrowing | No |
| Borrowed in Isolation | No |


### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:

The Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.

Furthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.

Artemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.

In recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.

In summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.

562,"### [Proposal and benefits for AAVE community]

[Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) provides web3 domains like Somename.crypto or somename.blockchain that can replace wallet addresses in crypto transactions. With 3M domains registered, 300+ coins/tokens supported and an ever growing ecosystem of compatible apps (660+ integration live today), Unstoppable Domains support would further reduce friction in recruiting new AAVE users, contributing to token value growth.

### [Proposed integration]

1. Search by domain name: The proposed integration would add Unstoppable Domains as an input option alongside ENS in the watch-only mode. Today in watch-only mode a user can either enter a wallet address or an ENS domain like 0xjimbob.eth. This integration would additionally allow users to type in UD domains such as 0xjimbob.nft. 

### [Technical integration]

Proposed integration implemented in https://github.com/aave/interface/pull/1243

This integration directly follows the feature that already exists for searching for .eth domains. It simply expands to include the ability to also search for the 3M+ domains supported by Unstoppable Domains. This does not impact the wallet connection modal nor include branding impacts in any way. 

### [Extra marketing benefits]

As a Defi platform supporting Unstoppable Domains, AAVE would benefit from evergreen presence on [Unstoppable supported apps section](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps) on all platforms. Unstoppable teams have agreed to provide marketing support aiming to grow AAVE usage: slots in UD's newsletter (300k audience), Posts on Socials (300k on Twitter, 125k on Tiktok), as well as AAVE mentions on relevant comms material at future events.",bullish

As the DAO's framework began to shift in Q3, Danko joined the Balancer Maxis workgroup, being responsible for onboarding new DAO members and helping contributors and third-party projects navigate the protocol. During this time, Danko has proven himself a reliable and trustworthy member of the Balancer community, representing Balancer in several key meetings, events, and conversations.

Danko is a Founding Member of BanklessBR DAO, a Brazilian community that helps people enter the web3 space, where he was a core-team contributor until last July, publishing and translating several articles, specially on the topic of DAO communities. He was also an active member of numerous NFT communities and supported local artists with web3 education.

IRL, Danko has more than 13 years’ experience in law enforcement as a forensic scientist and investigator. His formal academic background includes a Bachelor’s degree in law and a Masters degree in Public Policies. This drives Danko’s interest in the DeFi space in general, and the future of our industry.

As there will be no overlap of directors, there will be no additional cost to the Balancer DAO and no funds are requested under this proposal.

For more information regarding the role of a community director, please see the original [funding proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-14-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/3316) for the Balancer Foundation.",bullish

**Summary**

Restore brand trust in Balancer by assisting DNS hack users, allowing them to immediately recover 75% of lost funds, while Balancer continues to investigate this incident.  Users claiming immediate restitution shall forfeit all further claims relating to this incident, with any further recovery accruing to the Balancer DAO.

**Background**

On September 19, the Balancer frontend was attacked via social engineering on EuroDNS, the domain register used for .fi TLDs.

https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1704281611326357567

Due to prompt action from community members, damage was mitigated, and control was quickly restored.

https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1705250633782313431

https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1704552285395894422

Unfortunately, users interacting with the Balancer frontend while the attack was ongoing were affected.  Final damage numbers have not been published.  However, rough estimates would be around 200-300K USD.

**Motivation**

Brand trust is the public's perception of a brand's reliability and trustworthiness, as informed by both personal experience and marketing communication. It’s a complex concept that encompasses a variety of factors, including security and privacy, product quality, customer service, brand mission and values, and political or philanthropic efforts.  In crypto, brand trust is an important, and arguably the most vital, differentiator between comparable products in competitive market conditions.

Brand trust is a critical component of brand loyalty. Customers who trust a brand are more likely to utilize it again, even if they have a negative experience from time to time or one-off experiences that don't meet their expectations.

Consistency is another strong component of successful branding.  Communicating the same values in the same voice at every customer touchpoint--treating all users alike--is important in creating an authentic brand.  Inconsistent actions are unpredictable, and unpredictability dissuades consumers.

[[BIP-XXX] Decide on direction of restitution for affected LPs in Boosted Pool Incident](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-decide-on-direction-of-restitution-for-affected-lps-in-boosted-pool-incident/5187) is an excellent example of striving to restore brand trust.  While Balancer is neither obligated to provide restitution, nor responsible for user actions, the community has nonetheless found it worthwhile to seek a resolution to the first hack and make its users whole.

Similar, Balancer should attempt to take any possible actions within its power to mitigate harm caused by the second hack as well to known, affected users.  We propose that verified actors affected by the DNS hack be allowed to claim 75% of their lost funds from Balancer while it continues to investigate this incident, forfeiting further claims to their lost funds, with any additional funds recovered going to the Balancer DAO.  By doing so, Balancer will be not only be able to restore, but grow its brand trust, which will be essential if it seeks to succeed in the long term.  In today's competitive marketplace, users have more choices than ever before, and are increasingly demanding, especially with consumer security and safety. Consumers want to interact with brands, like Balancer, that can provide a safe transactional environment and positive overall experience.

**Specification**

Upon approval of this BIP, immediately send $117,806.25 USDC (72.0528468675 ETH) to address 0xD14f076044414C255D2E82cceB1CB00fb1bBA64c, a verified, known, damaged wallet, who will be providing an on-chain signature for wallet verification referencing this BIP in the comments below, along with a statement forgoing all further claims to restitution.  The amount to be sent is 75% of the $157,075 USD (96.07046249 ETH) total lost by this wallet during the attack period across 5 transactions, which can be verified on chain [here](https://etherscan.io/address/auramaxi.eth).

Further:

1.The max budget for this program shall be 350K USD.
2. A 60 day reporting window shall by announced via appropriate channels, including Discord and Twitter, following approval of this BIP, with a second reminder at 30 days, and a final reminder in the final week to deadline.  The 60 day claim period will start upon announcement of the claim window.
3. To submit claims, users will [verify wallet ownership](https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures) and report any DNS hack losses via a Google Form, which shall be prepared by a volunteer committee of 5 well-qualified, objective individuals with experience in DeFi opsec, who shall serve as a technical advisory committee to process these transactions.  Because a widely used angel drainer was used in this attack, it's not possible to determine whether tokens drained during the timeframe of the attack were from user interactions with the Balancer FE or from elsewhere.  Some blockers can be put in place to prevent potential double-dipping from the attacker himself, such as gathering identifying information on the claim form.  But ultimately, whether a user making a claim was truly affected will come down to a human call.  If the committee reviews a claim, finds it satisfactory, submits a BIP, and governance approves that BIP, then that claim is legitimized.
4. To validate and approve claims, the committee will verify the address and transaction details on Etherscan, arriving at an independent total to be compared against details submitted on the Google Form.  Should the details match, the claim shall be recommended for processing.  Should the details conflict, the claim will be rejected for resubmission.
5. To execute, the committee will aggregate all claims in batches, and prepare two BIPs to be approved by governance--one BIP to be submitted 30 days after the start of the 60 day claim period announcement, the second BIP to be submitted at the 60 day deadline.  Each BIP shall include a list of affected wallet addresses and amounts, and be sent to the Balancer DAO signers on the following Tuesday after each BIP has been approved, who shall use transaction builder to execute one multi-send transaction to send the verified amounts to the affected wallets.
6. Further claims following the 60 day period will require a new BIP and must go through governance.

**Voting**

To ensure the effectiveness of public relations campaigns, immediate action is necessary.  Consequently, we’d respectfully request that this BIP be moved to vote this week.

## Vision

[Pickle Finance][2] aims to become the home for Balancer LPs to enjoy the best possible returns and to become a major collaborator in the governance of the Balancer Protocol. 

## Abstract

Pickle is building a module on top of Balancer's Gauge system that seeks to aid Balancer LPs and prospective `veBAL` participants in maximising the utility of their deposits with Balancer, while also enhancing the overall utility of the Balancer's Gauge system by creating a liquid `veBAL` derivative.

Similar to other ""boosting protocols"", Pickle aims to create these synergies by providing an easy mechanism for the aggregation of `veBAL` boosts and for prospective Balancer LPs to benefit from this boost.

The Pickle and Balancer teams are no strangers to each other, with Pickle being invited and expressing its willingness to join the Balancer Wars as early as the Gauge system was announced. Pickle has borrowed from its unique experience running a Gauge system for itself and building on top of other boosting modules like Convex to come up with a unique system we call the Brinery. 

As a gesture of goodwill and to encourage the creation and adoption of the Balancer Brinery, Pickle will be providing incentives (in `$PICKLE` tokens) to both those who vote to whitelist us and those who join the Brinery early on. These incentives will be detailed pending their approval by Pickle governance. The Balancer community can expect the Pickle Core team to propose between 2-3% of the `PICKLE` supply to be awarded to Balancer Brinery incentives, with rougly 80% of these reserved for joiners and 20% for voters.

This proposal makes no request to the Balancer community for financial assistance to Pickle. We are a solvent, revenue-generating protocol with a healthy balance sheet. Our interest is in providing a superior service to Balancer users and to create a symbiotic relationship between our communities.

## Brinery Specification: Architecture & Design

The Brinery will provide a seamless experience for users to join `veBAL`. Our proposed system works in the following manner: 
1. Users deposit 80/20 BAL/ETH `BPT` with Pickle
2. Users receive **brinBAL** in return
3. Under the hood, Pickle will:
  a) Lock up a portion of `BAL/ETH` for `veBAL` in perpetuity - a receipt token is issued for the locked amount as **pveBAL**. A portion of `BAL/ETH` liquidity is retained
  b) Supply `pveBAL` and retained `BAL/ETH` into a new Balancer pool
4. Users can redeem `brinBAL` for their proportionate share of `pveBAL` and `BAL/ETH` (or in a single asset if they wish)

This design has the advantage of guaranteeing liquidity for Pickle's `veBAL` derivative. The Brinery contracts will have flexibility in managing liquidity to achieve the proper balance between liquidity and maximal rewards. Users who hold `brinBAL` will receive Balancer governance rewards (all fee-sharing rewards, emissions, and bribe proceeds will be consolidated into BAL tokens), the Brinery's ""flywheel"" rewards (`BAL` ""taxed"" from Brinery boosted PickleJars), and of course `PICKLE` tokens. 

For users familiar with our standard PickleJar, a series of Brinery Boosted Jars, or ""brinJars"", will be on offer to compound users' BPT positions, taking advantage of boosted rewards from the Brinery's `veBAL` lock, alongside `PICKLE` incentives. These novel Balancer Jars will rely on state-of-the-art infrastructure and comply with the EIP-4626 standard for maximal efficiency, security, and composability. 

## Pickle

### History

Pickle is one of the original yield aggregators in DeFi, bringing innovations such as incentivised auto-farming with its PickleJars. We have been building as an Ethereum-based DAO since September 2020. Our builders are well-known and have collaborated over their time in DeFi with many top-notch protocols and teams to build, conduct security reviews, or brainstorm and validate ideas. To name a few: Yearn, Sushi, Curve, Polygon, Frax, Alchemix, and of course, Balancer.

Pickle has crossed paths with Balancer on several occasions. Pickle was the first yield aggregator to build on top of Balancer on its launch in Polygon. Moreover, our `PICKLE-ETH` was only the second pool after `BAL-ETH` to launch with Balancer on Arbitrum. A cursory look at the [BAL mining scripts on GitHub][1] shows we are 1 of 11 Balancer partners. On Arbitrum, we are 1 of 3. We are brethren in DeFi and hope to remain so for many years to come.

Finally, Pickle was the first-ever protocol to adapt Curve's Gauge system to align its users and token holders into a better governance system we call `DILL`. More than 51% of all `PICKLE` is currently locked for an average of 3.23 years, with almost 1,000 `DILL` holders forming the DAO that backs our protocol.

### Team

Pickle is led by myself, joined by the rest of the core team which currently consists of another 12 individuals with a wide range of skills in product, product marketing, UX design, smart contracts engineering, and frontend and Web3 infrastructure development. 

### Governance

Pickle is run according to the principle of ""progressive decentralisation"" by the DILL DAO. DILL governance is currently upgrading so DILL holders receive 100% of protocol revenues generated by Pickle, in ETH, plus PICKLE anti-dilutive rewards. At present, using Pickle's Gauge system, DILL holders can vote on-chain for where PICKLE emissions should go. With support for delegation currently in development, Pickle aims to launch its own ""Pickle voting module"" so users can participate in governance, including PICKLE emission allocations across sidechains, via secure offchain voting.

The Pickle voting module to provide DILL holders an interface for directing `veBAL` voting power held by Pickle's Balancer Brinery, as well as select the allocation of PICKLE emissions amongst our various Brinery products. 

## Specification

If this vote passes, the Balancer DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction with `0x7869296Efd0a76872fEE62A058C8fBca5c1c826C` calling the function `allowlistAddress` with the argument `0x93318d4b44558f57B688C6943fA9E2c3e52540B0`

To drive value to BADGER



Here is the multisig ticket around seeding initial liquidity in these pools:

 ### Governance Process Request:
As this is the first gauge vote that AURA voters can vote on.  BadgerDAO requests that the snapshot for these gauges be extended to last 5 to 7 days in length in order to give the parties involved time to educate their user-bases about how to engage in this governance.

### References/Useful links:

### Protocol Description:

[BadgerDAO](https://www.badger.com) is launching a new set of products focused on ve ecosystems under a new Product Division called [Gravity](https://www.badger.com/gravity). The first Gravity product is[graviAURA](https://www.badger.com/graviaura).

![](upload://6DVS6GLh2AaOhbGY2c9kjBxm7Yq.jpeg)

graviAURA is a wrapped vlAURA token with bribe harvesting features similar to[bveCVX](https://www.badger.com/products/bvecvx), Badger’s liquid vlCVX token, which has been live and managing upwards of 2m CVX/vlCVX for the past 9 months. bveCVX is a well established DeFi product, with a 9 month history of successfully managing locking, unlocking, liquidity and orderly withdrawals. The new graviAURA product is a fork of bveCVX, extended with new balancer specific features designed to allow DAOs and other token based projects and communities to create and sustain liquidity. This feature can be described in one sentence as follows:

__The vote weight from graviAURA tokens in a Balancer pool with a gauge is used to vote for the pool the tokens are in.__

This solves the free rider problem. By including graviAURA in a pool, all depositors in said pool are voting for it equally. You cannot siphon yield from the pool by depositing and not voting. graviAURA automates locking of tokens, locking on a weekly cadence. Deposited tokens, as well as any unlocked tokens from a given week, can be withdrawn until the next lock. Additionally, gauges will provide limited liquidity when there is no AURA available for withdrawal.


### Motivation:

graviAURA is designed to help DAO’s create liquidity. Part of the bootstrapping plan for graviAURA involves supporting an ecosystem pool for at least the first 3 months. We would like to launch the ecosystem pools, as well as a BADGER pool, as our first graviAURA gauges.

We expect each of these pools to maintain a base natural yield even without external voting, due to the fixed weight of graviAURA(and hence underlying vlAURA) in each of the pools that will consistently vote for them. Note that some external driver will be required to bootstrap pools with initial self-voting capital or incentivize an increase in the size of the pool.

  


As soon as these gauges are up, BADGER will make the following changes to our voting and farming strategies around balancer:

- All free votes controlled by the BadgerDAO Treasury will initially be split between these 3 pools.
- All POL farming BAL will be moved from the BADGER/WBTC pool to the BADGER/graviAURA pool. (assuming all 3 gauges pass)
- Any fucoolture bribes will be directed only to graviAURA pools, and if possible offered on an Aura focused bribe market.



### Specifications:

**Governance:**  
BadgerDAO has a hierarchy of different multisig accounts that handle operations within the DAO. These have specific use cases and are outlined in detail in the repo linked here:[Badger Multisigs.](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-multisig/)The highest risk operations are controlled by a timelock address which needs to be triggered and has a 2 day time delay to perform any actions.

The Badger Multisig maintains governance over the contract, and can redelegate the votes to a new EOA should the wallet be compromised. The potential risk of this centralized element of the system is therefore the misdirection of all graviAURA votes for 1 voting round.

**Oracles:**

Badger does not rely on any external oracles

**Audits and review:**

Vaults 1.5 Quantstap audit:

C4 contest for graviAURA strategy: \[public results pending cool off period]

C4 contest results for bveCVX strategy (upstream repo of graviAURA):

Additional audit results can be found on badger.com under[Security & Audits](https://badger.com/security-and-audits).

**Centralization vectors:**

Badger utilizes upgradeable contracts for many of the products we offer. Badger upgradeable contracts are protected by a 2 day timelock.. Our API and frontend are hosted by centralized entities, but we are developing a fully permissionless IPFS hosted access point primarily intended for strategy development.



**Note:**Due to the snapshot voting element of AURA and the requirement to automatically calculate and regularly re-vote during rounds, voting is currently controlled by an EOA. This EOA sits in a secure keystore that is only accessible to 2 senior members of the Badger team and the bot which runs the voting script. Badger will work with Aura over time to decentralize snapshot voting as much as possible, and has an active workstream focused on removing centralization risks around automated snapshot based voting.



### Market History:

AURA, graviAURA and auraBAL are all new tokens focused on the balancer ecosystem and currently do not have significant liquidity or trading history. The purpose of these gauges is to help build that. Eth is a well known token with proven market history that is easy to find.

**Badger:** Is the governance token of BadgerDAO. It has currently been trading in an 80/20 BADGER/WBTC balancer pool that can be found here: [BADGER/wBTC 80/20 Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xb460daa847c45f1c4a41cb05bfb3b51c92e41b36000200000000000000000194). The treasury maintains additional Protocol owned liquidity on both Curve and Uniswap V3, and BADGER is well traded across a number of centralized exchanges, including FTX, Binance and Coinbase.

Title: [ARFC] Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum
Date: 2024-05-13
Author: Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)
---

## Summary

The proposal aims to onboard Threshold Network’s tBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum. tBTC is backed one-to-one with Bitcoin.

## Motivation/Background:

tBTC is Threshold’s decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum’s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.

Having recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).

tBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.

Threshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.

### Benefits for Aave:

- Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.
- A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.
- Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.
- Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.
- Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium’s LTIPP.

### Emission schedule

tBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.

### Risks

For tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - [Wallet Generation  Threshold Docs](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation)

The Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:

Title: [ARFC] Framework for ARFC and TEMP CHECK Proposals
Author: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative
Date: 2023-06-27
---

## Summary

This framework provides comprehensive guidelines for the Aave DAO community when creating and voting on ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) and TEMP CHECK proposals. It includes a template for crafting proposals and outlines the quorum and voting requirements.

## Motivation

### Distinction Between TEMP CHECK and ARFC

TEMP CHECKs serve as ""temperature checks"" to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.

Conversely, ARFCs are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.

### Proposal Template

Each proposal **must** include the following sections:

A header:
1. **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for the proposal, including the proposal type (ARFC or TEMP CHECK) in a [TAG] format.
2. **Author**: The name of the author and/or entity creating the proposal.
3. **Date**: The date the proposal is being made, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

A proposal body:

1. **Summary**: A succinct summary of the proposal.
2. **Motivation**: A detailed presentation of the proposal and potential benefits for the Aave protocol. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
3. **Specification**: A comprehensive description of the proposed change, including any relevant parameters or risk considerations. For ARFCs, this section should be technical, detailing the specific changes to be made. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
4. **Disclaimer**: Any necessary disclaimers, such as conflicts of interest or third-party involvement.
5. **Next Steps**: The proposed next steps if the proposal is approved.

## Background
The BAL for Gas initiative was introduced as a measure to entice and help users interested in trading ERC-20 tokens through the Balancer trading platform.

The introduction of the Gnosis partnership, however, will allow users to trade without requiring ETH for gas, so the gas reimbursement program becomes obsolete.

589,"# Simple summary

The [EIP-4824 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4824) defines common interfaces for DAOs via `daoURI`, akin to `tokenURI` for NFTs. This proposal will upgrade Aave DAO to EIP-4824 by deploying a new registration contract through a contract interaction with the EIP-4824 factory maintained by DAOstar.

# Rationale

Adopting the EIP-4824 standard will enrich the on-chain information availability of Aave governance contracts, making it easier for existing and future DAO tools to seamlessly interact with the contracts. A specific example is enabling members to interact with the Aave governance contracts through different front-end interfaces, potentially across multiple chains. Some of the tools that are digesting or committed to digesting this enriched information include Snapshot, Tally, DAOhaus, Etherscan, DeepDAO, and other members of [DAOstar One](https://daostar.one).

Note that adopting the standard does not require any parameter changes to Aave’s existing DAO contracts, nor is there any cost besides gas to call the factory contract. To make the process easier, we have already built and deployed 4824-compliant subgraphs for the component endpoints of `daoURI`, including `membersURI`, `proposalsURI`, and `activityLogURI`. What remains is for Aave to claim these off-chain endpoints via the on-chain process specified by EIP-4824. The proposal does not in any way change the way that Aave’s governance works.

DAOstar is a public goods project supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Aragon, Radicle, MolochDAO, MetaCartel Ventures, The Graph, and many other members of [DAOstar One](https://daostar.one).

# Governance action
By voting yes, you agree that Aave DAO will (1) upgrade to EIP-4824 by calling the EIP-4824 registration contract located at 0x37df3fc47c1c3a2acafd2dad9c1c00090a8655bc, with Joshua Tan of DAOstar/Metagov (thelastjosh.eth) as the temporary manager for the registration contract. No funds will be transferred.

By voting no, nothing happens.

# Technical details

To simplify adoption, we have [pre-built the subgraphs and endpoints](https://github.com/metagov/daostar/tree/main/Implementations/API#aave) for Aave DAO. The endpoints can be edited at will by the selected manager, or by another vote of the DAO itself. For example, here is a [live endpoint](https://maj79gmufj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aave/proposals/1/0xec568fffba86c094cf06b22134b23074dfe2252c) serving 4824-compliant data for Aave.

# Conclusion

This proposal will upgrade Aave DAO to EIP-4824 by deploying a new registration contract through a contract interaction with the EIP-4824 factory maintained by DAOstar. It is extremely low risk, benefits Aave DAO by upgrading it to the ecosystem standard, and also positions Aave as a leader on standards for the ecosystem.",neutral

593,"**Title:** [ARFC] Upgrade Safety Module with StkGHO

**Author:** Marc Zeller - ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

**Date:** 2023-11-21

---

## Summary
This ARFC introduces an enhancement to the Safety Module by integrating a GHO Safety Module. This new category aims to mitigate risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events within its ecosystem. It also reduces the Safety incentives for StkAAVE and StkBPT.

## Motivation

[AIP-366 was adopted by governance](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/366/) to reduce the safety incentives of StkAAVE and StkBPT, but an implementation bug made the AIP execution impossible. After discussion with DAO service providers, it was decided to bundle the re-run of 366 with the creation of the GHO safety module and the StkGHO asset.

The GHO Safety Module will fortify the Aave Protocol's resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversifies the Safety Module's capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.

The GHO Safety Module will target a liquidity pool of 9M GHO with an APR range of 12-15%, achievable with a daily emission of 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day period. The module will have a slashing rate set at 100%, meaning the entirety of the deposits could be utilized in a shortfall event, with socialized coverage among StkGHO holders. The cooldown period is adjusted to 10 days, which is suitable for a stablecoin.

## Specification
**Revised Safety Module Emissions Rate:**

| Asset      | Previous Emissions | Proposed Emissions |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| StkAAVE    | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |
| StkBPT     | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |
| StkGHO     | N/A               | 35 AAVE/day        |

- **GHO Safety Module Parameters:**
  - Target Liquidity: 9M GHO
  - Target APR: 12-15%
  - Emissions Period: 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day cycle
  - Slashing Rate: 100%
  - Cooldown Period: 10 days

## Next Steps
1. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage.

* The gas optimization contribution that has taken place continues to serve and save users a significant amount of funds for gas fees on a daily basis, so far as of 4th February, it has saved 80+ETH (which is 5.5% of the 3 years staking period) and expected to save a total of 1450ETH+ in the total 3 years staking period, please refer to the Dune dashboard.
* This proposal aims to review the proposed reward for AIP 161, the feedback from the community was eye opening and insightful to shape the current proposal.
* In summary, back when the staking contract was being audited through AIP34, I found multiple gas optimizations findings, which were shared with Immunefi and classified as out of scope, since they are only concerned about security findings. thereafter, due to the time scarcity to form an AIP and wait for it to pass to implement the gas optimizations and the mainnet launch was in the following 2-3 weeks. I decided to get it implemented by reaching out to Horizen Labs. which they were happy about the findings and implemented the findings at the last moments.
* This proposal will set an example and a motivation for open source contributors to contribute to the DAO and obey by one of the main DAO’s guiding values: “Collective Responsibility: We leave everything better than we found it.”

597,"Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on Base

Author: @fig - Flipside Crypto

Date: 2023-05-22

---

## Simple Summary

This Temperature Check seeks the community's input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Base mainnet, expanding Aave to a unique, OP-stack network.

## Background

Base is an open-source, developer-friendly L2 EVM blockchain, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. Base is incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase’s on-chain products and a sandbox for permissionless development.

Coinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launch of Base to help realize the Optimism superchain vision. Base testnet is currently live — and mainnet soon around the corner.

Docs are available at [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/)

Its mission and identity are stated clearly in the docs: ***Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users to web3.***

As a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective’s mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.

Four key principles have shaped Base that will continue to guide its approach:


**Open-source**

Base is built on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase is joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone.




**A bridge, not an island**

Base is optimized for easy, secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, as well as other L1 ecosystems like Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. Builders and users may start on Base, but go everywhere Base is a “bridge” for users into the crypto economy.



**Decentralization** 

 Decentralization is essential for the crypto economy ""to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone.” Coinbase is deeply committed to progressing toward full decentralization over the years ahead.


**For everyone**

Base is a vision to be an open ecosystem, seeded with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life.

 
Base has launched with a diverse array of launch partners, servicing different developer and user needs across data, block explorers, bridging, custody, DeFi, and others.

Please see the list below of robust launch partners:

 
![dd6a532ab00053c11ed6070d651915f493105e81_2_1380x712.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihs7se4xncwxlk4lrb3t4lkcsx2o2gkjqj6pt6rxplamuho5b2znm)
    

## Motivation

The Aave community has voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase across other prominent L2s such as Arbiturm, Metis, and Optimism.

By enabling Base on Aave, it creates valuable (and differentiated) revenue opportunities for Aave, capturing the growth and interest of users who live on the Coinbase platform.

Base is a way for Aave to instantly leverage Coinbase’s products and distribution: seamless Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to **110mm+** users and **$80B+** assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.

In the first week of Base, 18k developers deployed 55k smart contracts on testnet. This activity sustained through the network's announcement has the potential to introduce new, valuable users to DeFi and Aave.

Since Base's testnet launch on 02/23/2023, metrics illustrate strong activity:

* 2,000,000 accounts created
* 17,000,000 transactions
* 1,000,000+ addresses holding a Base Builder NFT for participating in in Quests

In addition, Base has shown impressive retention for a blockchain, with ~70,000 unique wallets returning to Base for subsequent transactions within one day. The users, likely early developers, paint a promising outlook for the activity that may be seen on mainnet.

## Specification

This *TEMP CHECK* presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Base mainnet on day one of its launch.

Suggested risk parameters for this asset are provided in the table below.

The community may decide to list more assets on this market depending on risk tolerance.

More information on the [Network Specifications](https://docs.base.org/network-information) may be found here.

## Disclaimer

The information provided above about Base is from public sources and Flipside Crypto cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.

For full disclosure, Coinbase partnered with Flipside Crypto upon the announcement of the network to make Base on-chain data available for free for analysts.

Coinbase has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and we are doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.

As a cautionary measure to prevent an appearance of a conflict of interest, Flipside will abstain from voting on this proposal - in line with other proposals we put forward.

This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.

## Next Steps

**Temperature Check:** Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Base Mainnet.

**ARFC:** If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.

**AIP:** If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.

title: ARC: Extend the Safety Module Protection to Aave V2 Avalanche
status: WIP
author: Governance House, @MatthewGraham @ncitron, 3SE Holding & uhom 
created: 25/07/2022

---

# Simple Summary

This ARC proposes to extend the Safety Module (SM) protection to V2 markets as the smart contracts have been extensively battle tested.

# Abstract

The Safety Module is a $700m risk mitigation pool holding that protects Aave users. It’s a unique mechanism within DeFi, that pushes borrowing capacity while providing security for users. At the moment the SM only covers the Aave V2 Ethereum market. As a result, not all users across the V2 markets share the same level of risk protection.

As new markets hold more risk at launch, they are initially excluded from the SM protection. Today, most of the V2 markets have been extensively battle tested and have been generating collections for the Aave DAO, they seem fit for SM protection.

# Motivation

The SM is one of the largest risk mitigation pools of DeFi. This pool was designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market. As new markets hold additional risk, these are not initially protected by the SM. However, once a market has been live and battle tested for a few months, the risks are significantly lower. Furthermore, the listed assets are currently similar across markets and follow the same rigorous listing process, with an assessment based on the Aave Risk Framework 2.

Overall, these markets are smaller than the Ethereum V2 Market, holding combined supplied and borrowed assets of just half of the Ethereum V2 market. This implies that, in case of a shortfall event in an Aave market, the shortfall would likely be smaller on those markets than on the Ethereum V2 market. Overall by covering different markets the SM would benefit from diversification of risks, as these are not additive but rather follow the law of large numbers.

Extending the SM coverage to other V2 markets reduces the risk for liquidity providers (lps) on these markets. By reducing the risk for lps, it is expected to lead to further growth of the market’s TVL overtime. Through standardising the application of the SM across the markets, lps are treated more equally across the markets.

The Safety Module protection needs to take into account the additional risks of these markets. In the case of Aave markets on other chains, the SM will only protect in cases where the Aave smart contracts experience a failure, and not failures caused by the chains themselves (Polygon/Avax). With regards to the Aave Arc Market, Safety Module protection is contingent upon acceptance of the Aave DAO’s stated risk parameters, should the whitelisters of the Arc market reject a DAO approved Risk Parameter update, the market will lose coverage until it is brought back in compliance with the DAOs stated tolerance.

These markets have become core components of the Aave ecosystem. In particular, the Polygon and Avalanche markets have opened the Aave Protocol to new users for which Ethereum transaction costs are prohibitive. Today, most users prefer these markets with over 1m addresses having used Aave V2 Protocol on Polygon, while just about 100k on Ethereum V2. These markets also represent a large share of the protocol revenue bringing in half of the ecosystem collections, in a shorter time period.

# Specification

The table below shows the Aave V2 markets, assets listed and ecosystem collections for the Aave DAO.

599,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal seeks approval to establish a process and framework to build out a “Delegate Community Program"" for the purpose of fostering inclusivity, further decentralization of cultural governance, and encouraging collaboration with ApeCoin from diverse web3 communities.

A ‘Delegate Community’ in essence acts as a sub-DAO and utilizes voting rights delegated to it by the ApeCoin DAO. Per any other delegate voting entity, the $ape tokens remain in the custody of the owner - in this case the ApeCoin DAO

‘Delegate Communities’ will establish Snapshot Organisations which will deploy ERC-721 strategies, enabling their respective communities to vote on proposals using their own NFTs. In turn, the result of their internal vote will dictate the direction of their delegated ApeCoin vote. This mirrors the Mocaveerse model.

To incentivise participation, ‘Delegate Communities’ will receive a share of TBD $ape grant on a TBD frequency for participating in a TBD percentage of AIPs.

Much like recent Working Group AIPs, this proposal is not requesting approval for the final program implementation. Rather, this proposal is introducing voters to the concept of delegating power to and incentivising communities across web3 to engage with ApeCoin and its governance.

For the avoidance of doubt, there is NO COST FOR THIS INITIAL PROPOSAL.

If successfully passed, however, there will be a follow-up proposal to outline and agree the process for:
* Implementation
    * Period Covered: Fixed, Rolling etc
* Vote Delegation
    * How many votes to ring fence and delegate
* Delegate Community Selection
    * How many
    * Qualifying Criteria
* Rewards/Incentives
    * Amount of $ape for the rewards
    * Frequency of rewards
    * Qualification/KPIs
* Administrative Oversight
    * People - who is managing this stream
    * How are they incentivised
    * How is success (theirs and the proposal) measured
    * Detailed overview of the deployable process including systems, transparency and community engagement

I intend to work with the Ape Assembly to propose the above items and any other considerations that will be needed to implement the final process.

####  BENEFITS TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:

By creating delegate communities, the DAO benefits from distribution via new, currently disengaged communities. New, diverse perspectives from these communities will increase and improve AIP creation potentially leading to better governance and growth of the ApeCoin ecosystem.

####  OVERALL COST

The overall cost for this proposal is zero.

### Protocol Description:

> tBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin, that is 1:1 backed by mainnet BTC.
> 
> Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.
> 
> tBTC is trust minimised and redeemable for mainnet BTC without a centralized custodian.

## Motivation:

> This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the Balancer tBTC/WBTC pool on Ethereum.
> 
> Threshold DAO seeks to consolidate deep liquidity on Mainnet, and Balancer is an ideal venue to build upon.
> 
> The DAO has budgeted T token bribes to incentivise this tBTC/WBTC pool, with the goal to attract liquidity to the pool and Balancer. Threshold DAO intends this pool to be a part of the long-term tBTC strategy.

### Specifications:

>1. Governance:
> tBTC operates on Threshold DAO’s decentralized threshold encryption protocol. Threshold DAO is governed by the network’s work token, T. T token holders govern the DAO via proposals raised to the Threshold forum, which can be raised to a vote via Snapshot, as well as the on-chain Governor Bravo module via Boardroom.
> tBTC contract deployments are currently managed via the Council multi-sig, a 6-of-9 multi sig managed by trusted community members: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f
>In the future, all contract authorities will be passed to the Governor Bravo contract.

> 2. Oracles:
> tBTC does not rely on an oracle price feed.

>3. Audits:
>* [Least Authority](https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-keep-network-tbtc-bridge-v2/) 
>* [Chainsecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/threshold-network/)
>* [Certik](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/threshold-network)
>* [Immunefi Bug Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/)

> 4. Centralization vectors:
> Threshold Network governance is decentralized, and updates are ratified by the DAO.
> tBTC contracts updates are currently managed by the Council multi-sig.

> 5. Market History:
> tBTC is a wrapped BTC token, and is pegged to the price of BTC. Since launch, tBTC’s price has not significantly diverged from that of BTC. tBTC launched in January of 2023, and currently has ~1000 BTC to collateralize the ~1000 tBTC.

### Value:

> The Ethereum tBTC/WBTC pool is intended to be a lynchpin of BTC liquidity on Mainnet.
> 
> Threshold DAO has allocated a portion of its incentives budget to bribe the tBTC/WBTC pool via Paladin.
> 
> Balancer will benefit by attracting additional BTC liquidity.

602,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

Firstly, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to farms – the per block allocation to Farms and Lottery will remain at [**~2.01 CAKE/block**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics).

Importantly, the purpose of these proposals is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. In other words, redistributing farm rewards from the farms mentioned below will boost APRs for all other farms. 

By boosting APRs for higher-performing farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more capacity to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

Deploy Aave V3 on the EVM-compliant L1 network Fantom Opera.

### Proposer

Michael Kong is the CEO/CIO of the Fantom Foundation, a core contributor to Fantom, and a long time Aave supporter.

### Abstract

The Fantom Foundation is at the Aave community's disposal to help facilitate a deployment of Aave V3 on Fantom, an EVM compatible L1 chain with the [6th largest TVL according to DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/chains).

### Motivation

This proposal follows up on the original [Fantom Launch thread](https://governance.aave.com/t/launch-aave-on-fantom/5868) on Aave Governance which received [99.74% support](https://snapshot.org/#/fantomecosystem.eth/proposal/QmSTMpJq4Hbzhd7GifqNUMQTSrW1nbhnFJ88pzRDhu3fB5) from the Fantom community.

Fantom has over $7bn TVL and is host of popular DeFi applications originating from Ethereum such as Curve, Yearn, and Abracadabra, in addition to homegrown apps such as SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, and BeethovenX.

The network TVL is growing fast, having had $5bn in October 2021, and a mere $0.14Bn a year ago.

The Fantom native token FTM is listed on major exchanges, has a Market Cap of $7.6bn, and a combined 24h Volume of $2.1bn [according to CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/fantom/).

### Implementation

* Fantom supports multi-sig, subgraphs, chainlink and band oracles, among other common infrastructure, making a launch seamless.
* Upon launch, Aave would most likely be eligible for the [Fantom Incentive program](https://fantom.foundation/blog/fantom-incentive-program-how-to-apply/), where projects may receive **up to 6,000,000 FTM** vested monthly.
* The Fantom Foundation offers its team of engineers to help with any integration and infrastructure challenges or questions as they may arise.

608,"## Summary

Chaos Labs proposes an amendment to our current scope of work and compensation structure accordingly. Chaos Labs is currently contracted to cover V3. We propose to formally expand our scope of work to cover all of Aave, including V2 and GHO. Chaos Labs is requesting a $400,000 increase, bringing our total annual compensation to $1.5M. 

We view this expansion of work as an all-encompassing commitment and, with this, take responsibility for all Aave lending markets and financial products for the remainder of the term. Specifically, this means that there will be no further compensation increase requests, regardless of additional deployments, features, or initiatives prioritized during this time. 

## Background

Chaos’ initial engagement with Aave, starting in November 2022, focused exclusively on risk management and parameter recommendations across V3 markets ([Discussion link](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025)). In early January, prior to the launch of V3 Ethereum, the community approved a 5-month [extension](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/139/) of our engagement to cover V2 markets, which expired in early June 2023. Despite coverage and compensation expiring, Chaos Labs has continued to demonstrate unwavering dedication to managing V2 risk and promoting the transition to V3 while allocating significant resources.

Furthermore, we have committed extensive resources to integrate V2 markets into our product suite and put forward comprehensive analyses and proposals. Given that the transition to V3 is a protracted and ongoing commitment, it remains crucial to maintain proactive risk management for V2 in the transition phase. This necessity was underscored in the recent industry-wide deliberation surrounding the CRV market. Chaos formulated a mitigation strategy now being implemented via a series of governance proposals.

As risk contributors to the protocol, we at Chaos Labs embrace an all-encompassing perspective. We view our domain of accountability and responsibility as the entire spectrum of Aave, including V2, V3 (all deployments), and the most recent launch of GHO,  as they pertain to risk, data science, parameter recommendations, analytics, and more. With this in mind, the amendment to our compensation will more accurately reflect the dedicated resources we allocate, the breadth and depth of our commitment, and the tangible value we provide to Aave. 

## **Scope:**

As outlined in the background section, the scope of our work is expansive, encompassing every element related to market risk throughout the Aave protocol. Below, we highlight the core components of our engagement:

### V2+V3

- **Risk Parameter Optimization** - Deploying our agent-based simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a distinguished team of data scientists and researchers, we provide the community with comprehensive analyses and recommendations for risk parameter settings and strategies. Our paramount goal is to optimize protocol revenue while protecting user funds and mitigating potential risk vectors.
- **Risk Monitoring and Alerting** - We offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations.
- **Protocol Growth** -  We provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.
- **Incident Response and Ongoing Market Impact Analysis -**  We maintain an active role in incident response, ready to react promptly and effectively in the event of any market anomalies or security incidents. Furthermore, we continually analyze the repercussions of market events and potential risk scenarios, empowering us to refine our strategies and bolster the resilience of the Aave protocol.
- And more

### GHO

- **Parameter Optimization** - Chaos Labs will conduct data-driven research and simulations to recommend optimizations for GHO-specific parameters, including Borrow rate, stkAAVE discount rate, bucket capacities, and DEX liquidity goals. Additionally, Chaos Labs will extend its current V3 Ethereum Asset Listing framework to include rigorous analysis of how new asset types can affect GHO composition and stability.
- **Ongoing Risk Management, Monitoring, and Analytics -** Chaos Labs will continue iterations on our unified risk monitoring and alerting platform for GHO, across primary markets (Aave), including all facilitators and secondary markets (centralized and decentralized exchanges). Our risk management services include economic reviews of GHO and ecosystem adoption across primary and secondary markets, peg stability, GHO backing composition, and more.
- **Facilitators Risk Framework, Recommendations, and Monitoring** - Chaos Labs will create a risk framework to consider potential facilitators and their corresponding GHO credit lines and provide ongoing risk analysis for potential and existing facilitators based on this framework.
- And more

## Terms

We request an additional $400K for the remainder of our current engagement, bringing the total annual compensation to $1.5M.


## Specification:

If this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0) as the recipient.

In terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 400,000 aUSDT. This stream will be scheduled to conclude on November 7th, 2023, coinciding with the termination of our original engagement.

## Disclaimer:

Chaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and Tashi. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.

This proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Tooling Upgrade
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @defiJesus & @efecarranza
created: 2023-10-23

---

# Summary

The publication suggests that the Aave DAO contracts @TokenLogic to develop various smart contracts aimed at assisting in the management of the DAO's Treasury.

# Motivation

At present, the Aave DAO has a mechanism for bridging funds between Polygon and Ethereum using the [Aave Polygon-Mainnet ERC20Bridge](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-helpers/tree/master/src/bridges) via the shortExecutor. This contract was created by @efecarranza during their tenure at [Llama](https://governance.aave.com/t/update-on-aave-swapper-and-strategic-asset-manager-contracts/14522/3).

To ensure the Aave DAO's financial stability and the ability to transfer assets across different networks through the shortExecutor, it is crucial to establish equivalent contracts for other networks. One such scenario involves moving USDC from Avalanche to Ethereum, effectively extending the DAO's stable coin runway.

This publication recommends the development of the following tooling contracts:

1) Avalanche to Ethereum
2) Optimism to Ethereum
3) Arbitrum to Ethereum

Upon the creation of these contracts, they will become public goods within the Aave ecosystem. This means that anyone will have the capability to draft a payload for transferring the DAO's funds between various networks with minimal effort.

Once the Avalanche to Ethereum bridge contract is completed, TokenLogic intends to propose a fund migration to the Ethereum Treasury to support the ongoing financial stability of the DAO.

# Specification

TokenLogic is to create the following contracts:

1) Avalanche Bridge to Ethereum
2) Arbitrum Bridge to Ethereum
3) Optimism Bridge to Ethereum
4) Transfer Funds Avalanche to Ethereum

@BGDLabs is to review and approve these contracts.

# Funding

To facilitate the development and implementation of the previously mentioned contracts, this publication seeks the following funding:

**Funding Amount:** $12,430.00, to be paid in GHO.
**Delivery Schedule:** The estimated timeframe for completion is approximately 5 weeks, which includes the review by @BGDLabs (an estimated 2 weeks).

The deliverables will undergo approval by @bgdlabs to ensure their completeness. The Avalanche bridge contract will play a pivotal role in moving funds from Avalanche to Ethereum, thereby providing support for the DAO's financial stability.

The transfer of funds as per the approved amount will occur upon the successful delivery of the contracts. The Aave DAO is encouraged to vote on one of the following three options:

1) YAE
2) NAE
3) ABSTAIN

# Next Steps

1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will commence building the contracts.

The DAO is expected to uphold outcome of the Snapshot vote.

612,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-boosted-pools-authorize-gauntlet-and-the-ballers-multisig-to-manage-pool-parameters/2400).

The Boosted Pools factories were deployed to mainnet last week, and the Balancer app now supports them too.

The authorizations to be ratified by this proposal would enable Gauntlet and a multisig controlled by Ballers to control certain parameters of the Boosted Pools so as to increase their capital efficiency and returns to liquidity providers.

## Motivation

The Boosted Pools smart contracts ( `AaveLinearPool` and `StablePhantomPool` ) contain a series of parameters that affect their efficiency and can be tuned depending on market conditions:

* Boosted Stable Pools ( `StablePhantomPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * amplification parameter
  * token rate cache duration
* Boosted Linear Pools ( `AaveLinearPool` ):
  * swap fee
  * lower target
  * upper target

Gauntlet has been managing fees and amplification factor in weighted and stable pools, and would be able to do so for Boosted Stable Pools if this proposal is approved by the community.

The duration of the token rate cache can have an impact on a boosted pool’s capital efficiency. If the duration is too long, the pool can be arbed for all the interest accrued on Aave since the last update of the cache. A short duration mitigates this risk, with the downside of increasing gas costs for trades.

On Linear Pools, swap fees are not collected by liquidity providers, but rather act as an incentive for arbitragers/keepers to:

1. withdraw main tokens from the pool, deposit them in Aave and deposit the aTokens in the pool when it has main tokens in excess;
2. withdraw aTokens from the pool, withdraw the underlying from Aave and deposit the main token to the pool when it has a low balance of main tokens;

The lower and upper targets determine a range within which no fee in imposed on trades between main tokens and Aave tokens. A trader moving the balance of main tokens away from this range pays a fee to the pool, which the pool then returns to traders that move the balance back towards the range.

While we’re confident that Gauntlet can hit the ground running with respect to optimizing the swap fee and amplification factor of Boosted Stable Pools, there’s still much to be learned when it comes to the other four parameters described above. For this reason, this proposal would authorize a multisig held by Ballers to set those parameters. Balancer Labs would monitor the activiy on the pools and the market conditions and advise on the the best course of action, but Ballers would be the ultimate decision makers, acting on behalf of BAL holders. All updates would be announced in Discord beforehand.

Gauntlet proposes adjusting interest rate parameters for the Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche Aave V2 markets. Tokens impacted include USDP, FRAX, USDT, GUSD, WETH, WBTC, WAVAX, and WMATIC. Forum post can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v2-interest-rate-curve-recommendations-from-gauntlet-2023-04-21/12846).

# Abstract
Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet’s platform has evaluated all assets on Aave V2's Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche markets and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. Last November, we proposed interest rate curve changes for the Aave V2 Ethereum market using our interest rate curve optimization framework. Our methodology makes data-informed decisions around setting borrower and supplier interest rates when market conditions require the protocol to reduce risk or when strategic opportunities present themselves to increase protocol revenue without materially impacting risk. This analysis further finetunes the interest rate curves of Aave V2 Ethereum, and extends our methodology to Polygon and Avalanche.

## Objectives
Among other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve:

1. **mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool**
2. **build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future**

As a secondary objective, we want to **optimize the user experience of Aave's borrowers and suppliers**.

title: ARC - Consolidate Aave V1, V2 & AMM Reserve Factors, Purchase CVX and Deploy to Earn Yield
author: Llama Community @MatthewGraham @Dydymoon 
created: 03/01/2022

https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797
---

# Simple Summary

The Aave V1, V2, and AMM market Reserve Factors (RF) on the Ethereum network hold a combined value of over [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). The Llama Community proposes consolidating the RF into the V2 RF and deploying the capital with the intention of retaining TVL and earning additional yield. The yield generated comes with the added benefit of acquiring governance tokens of other DeFi protocols and increasing Aave’s metagovernance influence.

# Abstract

The Llama Community recommends implementing several yield generating strategies spanning Balancer, Curve, and Convex and subsequently participating in the respective communities' tokenomic constructs. Aave will earn yield in the form of swap fee income, aToken yield derived from Aave V2, and governance token incentives in the form of BAL, CRV, CVX, stkAAVE and LDO.

The first investment theme is deploying capital into the Balancer Boosted Pool and BTC Stable Pool to earn a vAPY of around 13.4% and 4.6% respectively. The Balancer Boosted Pool invests around 80% or more of the deposited liquidity into Aave V2 to earn yield whilst also generating swap fees, stkAAVE, and BAL rewards. The Stable Pool generates income via swap fees and BAL rewards, with the latter making up the majority of the incentives on both strategies.

The second investment theme is more complex. It involves acquiring both CVX and veCRV to participate in gauge weight voting on Curve in order to influence a portion of the CRV inflation schedules to be distributed to aToken pool Liquidity Providers (LPs). Aave will deploy stables and ETH from the RF to earn additional CRV and CVX rewards, which will be used to further boost the incentive allocation to the aToken pools.

The data presented here is accurate as of the end of December 2021 data.

# Motivation

## Part A - Consolidation

The legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times. There is only ~[$219M](https://app-v1.aave.com/home) of TVL remaining in the V1 market, and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time.

![|602x232](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Kqln89Od7cLnxfnd5sEq4gn6xMD2yrAocqa8nJOaXQoyjQ4GlNkgfw8pQ7E2skefYXPdtiqSLwWL_KtYcNiO6Qjciy0I296Q7eiz0R9_NEO1nhZSPJtMqR-eDXg4N7SOqTj-zsEC)

This proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1, V2, and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield. The V1 RF holds around ~[$821K](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae) of assets at the time of writing, whereas the Ethereum V2 + AMM market holds [$27.45M](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) of assets. Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). A summary of the main assets held in the V1 RF are shown below:

![|602x232](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/947026c5031f95dbb5c76d9939f772d746867d90.png)

## Part B - Retain TVL & Increase Returns

Whilst holding aTokens is arguably one of the lowest risk yield opportunities in DeFi and something Llama Community encourages most, if not all, treasuries to hold. The Aave DAO is fortunate since it receives income in the form of aTokens. Thus, Llama recommends firstly making all unproductive stable coins productive and then optimizing further by earning additional yield and metagovernance influence.

The two main high level strategies proposed in this ARC share three common goals:

* Retain TVL within Aave
* Exceed aToken returns
* Accumulate metagovernance influence

In addition to these three goals, the Convex / Curve strategies have the added benefit of improving the extrinsic use cases for aTokens. aToken holders will be able to deposit liquidity into the Curve aToken pools and then deposit the Liquidity Provider (LP) token into either Curve or Convex to earn additional yield.

The Compound pool on Curve has [$174.5M](https://curve.fi/compound/) of TVL relative to the Aave pool which has [$55.3M](https://curve.fi/aave/) of TVL.This is most likely due to the higher incentive APR that the Compound pool, 10.13% vAPY, relative to the Aave pool earning 7.58% vAPY on Convex.

# Specification

## Overview

Llama proposes diversifying $26,67M (94.36%) of the combined Ethereum RFs across three protocols: Convex, Curve and Balancer. The combined Aave V1, AMM, and V2 market RF totals [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) at the time of writing. A detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the [Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) and a high-level overview is shown in the figure below.

The table below shows the assets that will be deployed within this proposal. Note this is only 94.4% of the assets and 5.6% of the assets are to remain unchanged within the Aave V2 RF.**

![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/c/c10a19f49f9edbbd241d7a280d0a0541e2bf9316.png)


The table above includes the following stablecoins, DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD and sUSD from the Aave V1 and V2 markets. The AMM markets holdings have not been included as they only total $119.3K at the time of writing.

The table below shows asset allocation per each strategy:

![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/33eaba04a8080fdd0c5b6496090155a98965bab4.png)

The balance within the Aave V2 RF, not deployed in one of the above strategies is shown as Other (Longtailed Assets) in the figure below. The percentages reflect the overall composition of the RF, noting that 94.4% of the consolidated RF is deployed into one of the strabled detailed in the above table.

**![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DLtTpPMVMYL0mhKSaCrroYwwD4r3-3uRDgwUjLIeZjrmMwnQ8i7-PSfgrwnHJLJnd5b4GfeTIhVuaW1emtWc12o-YFyQTqgVMOMyPni023sKbTxZFpyneBVCGu_eV3u-UuvOcsLc ""Chart"")**

The actual implementation of this proposal is likely to be spread across several AIPs. This is to reduce the implementation complexity and allow the several positions to be swapped / redeemed before being deployed into a bonding curve whilst we await the Chainlink CVX oracle being released and getting the Aave V2 RF whitelisted to deposit into the CRV locking contract to attain veCRV.

The subsequent sections provide further insight into each strategy and how they are to be funded.

## Convex / Curve Strategy

### Convex Allocation

The Convex (CVX) allocation is to be funded by the assets mentioned in the table below:

**![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/468f451db851df2f8c4ec9f3bc28fd81647492da.png)**

In order to fund the initial $2M purchase of CVX, all of the AMPL, BUSD and TUSD will be used ($842.2K) and the balance, $1,16M, will be funded with USDC. This is the initial purchase of CVX and with a unit price of $43.20 is equivalent to about 46,300 CVX tokens.

We expect to make additional CVX purchases in order to meet the minimum voting hurdle required to influence how Convex’s veCRV holding is deployed on Curve gauges. Based upon this [snapshot](https://vote.convexfinance.com/#/proposal/QmRgsaGswSgzuzaiiH385StTGsv5TVdhAA1LWBGWR3yyLp) and the [Voting Rules and Information](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/voting-and-gauge-weights) section of Convex’s documentation, we estimate around 70,000 CVX votes are needed to clear the hurdle rate. This is expected to cost a further $1.02M to what is proposed above and represents less than 1 months revenue. We intend to fund this through future revenue and have a sufficient buffer to the hurdle rate based upon voter participation on Convex’s snapshot.

The assets are to be converted to ETH and then used to purchase CVX via a Bonding Curve with a 50 bps premium that utilizes a Chainlink oracle price feed. Alternative methods can be discussed in the comments. However, we opt for a solution that can be implemented entirely through the AIP governance process and does not include manual trading.

AMPL is the most illiquid of the mentioned tokens and this position will need to be converted to ETH over a series of transactions. Trades are to be routed through an aggregator with MEV protection like CowSwap. The most liquid AMPL pools are on Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap. Wherever possible, aTokens will be swapped rather than redeemed in an attempt to retain TVL in the Aave V2 market.

The newly acquired CVX will be locked for 16 weeks with voting rights delegated to Llama in order to vote on both Aave and sAave gauges via Convex’s snapshot to increase the amount of CRV rewards received on the Curve pools. Voting occurs every 2 weeks via Snapshot and thus the need for a delegate.

The locked CVX also receives a portion of the protocol fee income and votes on how Convex’s veCRV are distributed across Curve’s gauges. Llama Community acting as the delegate will vote to boost CRV rewards on the Aave pool as a priority and sAave once sufficient voting influence has been attained.

### 4 Year Locked Curve (veCRV) Allocation

The aCRV tokens that have accumulated within Aave V2 are to be redeemed for CRV and then locked for 4 years on Curve to receive an equal amount of veCRV. This strategy is subject to Aave’s V2 RF being approved and whitelisted via Curve’s governance process.

![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/21477469e7d025cafd72614e98c3e6cd4e3236cf.png)

The veCRV position will then be used to vote for CRV incentives to be allocated to the Aave and sAave pools via the respective gauges. Based on the CVX strategy discussed prior, these veCRV votes are likely to be allocated to the sAave gauge.

Subject to the timeline and attaining the whitelist permission to deposit into Curve’s veCRV contract, the alternative strategy is to convert CRV to cvxCRV, then stake to earn CRV, CVX and 3crv, pulse any airdrops that go to veCRV holders. This is expected to generate 47.35% vAPY, see snippet below.

**![|602x244](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v6jyNfHVIrr7ovNveVCupxypxFTzoZfLAP3_aGSwRHVcNezLxZIPvmmLHitPMI7TzrFRm9G-SRpimpcuJqnZLX-OvJ5SUai1_2jStwPxr02Uyge60q2WDCx0dS4eU4GnwAblDACD)**

The earned CRV will be converted to cvxCRV and this will compound over time. The earned CVX will be locked to increase Aave’s voting influence and the 3crv will be exchanged for CRV, then converted to cvxCRV to further compound the strategies returns over time.

### Productive aToken Stable Strategy

The sAave and Aave strategies include depositing capital into a Curve pool and then staking the LP token on Convex to earn stkAAVE, CVX and CRV rewards. The two strategies are expected to generate around 4.07% vAPY and 6.19% vAPY before Aave’s CRV and CVX voting influences the CRV incentive derived yield.

The table below shows the allocation, how each strategy is funded, and which pool those funds are to be deposited into.

![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/03ca5c3d9bf70c960c6769e35b6a630d64b6ce18.png)

### Productive ETH Strategy

After transferring the ETH from Aave V1 RF to Aave V2 RF, the awETH is to be redeemed for ETH and the combined ETH deposited into the Curve stETH pool. The LP token steCRV is to then be deposited and staked in Convex to earn CRV, CVX and LDO incentives. The expected yield is around 6.65% vAPY.

![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/3d101f6f395bb1310f0d58031136da366e6ee838.png)

No vlCVX or veCRV voting rights will be used to attract CRV incentives on this pool as the pool does not contain any aTokens.

## Balancer Strategy

### Balancer Boosted Pool Strategy

Balancer has recently launched the first [Boosted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe?utm_source=website&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=aaveboostedpools) on Wednesday 16th December and liquidity mining incentives have already commenced generating around 13.4% vAPY at the time of writing. Using the [Stable Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42000000000000000000000063) as a guide, we expect Balancer to grow the Boosted Pool with the use of Liquidity Mining (LM) and even replace the Stable Pool in time.

The Balancer Boosted Pools earn swap fee income, LM incentives, and a new type of yield derived from unproductive capital being deposited into Aave V2 to earn yield. Llama expects the yield of the Boosted pool to exceed the Stable Pool in order to entice users to move across. Llama expects LM incentives to be the mechanism for achieving an elevated return while the pool is in its bootstrapping phase.

The strategy for Aave is to deposit an equal amount of DAI, USDC and USDT into the Boosted Pool. All BAL rewards are to be retained to accumulate governance influence.

![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/57b902e46f625cfea122142b56fd0d0ccbe75579.png)

Following Chainlink’s Harmony deprecation, replace all existing price feeds by Chainlink on Aave v3 Harmony with fixed price adapters (with the last known Chainlink price).

Additionally, update interest rate strategies to one with exact zero values.

## Motivation

As Harmony remains unstable following the bridge exploit, and [Chainlink is planning to shut down all the price feeds on the network](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=harmony&page=1), we believe that the most neutral solution (since there are still users who can withdraw) is to replace the Chainlink feeds with fixed adapters that return the last available price.

Additionally, since the pool dynamics are non-functional, accruing any debt makes no difference, even if it was already set to minimal. Therefore, we are going to replace the interest rate strategies for every asset with a zero-interest one.

Call `AaveV3Harmony.ORACLE.setAssetSources()` passing the appropriate parameters to replace the price feeds of the assets on the Aave v3 Harmony Pool.
For each asset on the pool, call `PoolConfigurator.setReserveInterestRateStrategyAddress(asset, zeroInterestRateStrategy)` to replace their rate strategy.

AgEUR is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin minted by the Angle protocol. Users of the Angle Protocol can mint AgEUR by locking collateral in vaults.

For more information about AgEUR, please refer to [AgEUR Polygon V3 ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-ageur-on-aave-v3-on-polygon/7325).

This ARFC presents the Aave governance with an opportunity to onboard AgEUR to Aave Optimism V3 as a non-collateral asset.

## **Abstract**

This ARFC presents the Aave governance with an opportunity to onboard AgEUR to Aave Optimism V3 as a non-collateral asset.

## **Motivation**

AgEUR is the leading EUR-pegged decentralized stablecoin.

While the current market for EUR-pegged stablecoins is still anecdotal, the ACI supports stablecoin diversity in both the USD-pegged flavors and outside of USD-pegged assets.

AgEUR is designed to be efficient and can be minted at fair value using another stablecoin, which helps ensure that the peg remains resilient over time.

The proposed risk parameters are merely suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI is inviting Risk Service Providers to provide feedback on them.

## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. In addition, we propose freezing the KNCL reserve.


## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.


## Specification

The recent market downturn on the weekend of December 4th led to the most liquidations on both centralized exchanges and in liquidity protocols in the recent past. Most liquidations on the Aave protocol happened between 4:30 and 5:45 UTC when the price of ETH dropped nearly 13%. Below is a graph of liquidation by collateral and repay asset.
![Liquidations by collateral and repay asset](https://i.imgur.com/gDTtU13.png)
Although volatility for assets is slightly higher, the abundance of liquidity and active market participants is a positive sign for the health of Aave! For example, the total value of CRV (curve dao token) liquidated was large compared to the total collateral used on Aave. Lower LTV, lower liquidation threshold, and higher liquidation bonus protect the protocol from insolvencies. However, multiple liquidations of over 400,000 USD occured in quick succession. This shows ample liquidity for liquidators even in times of high network congestion. These market events provide important data points for measuring tail risk.

For reference, previous analysis of liquidations on Aave from May 2021 can be found here: https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/aave-protocol-liquidation-retrospective-may-2021-67c655fc1b31

Although some assets currently have higher volatility, our analysis shows that it is safe to increase borrowing parameters and decrease liquidation bonus values. Our simulations study price drops and network congestion more extreme than was seen last week, and slippage and liquidity considerations have improved.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAT Loan To Value     | 70%     | 75%     |
| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |
| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |
| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 60%     |
| REN Liquidation Threshold     | 60%     | 65%     |
| SNX Loan To Value    | 30%     | 40%     |
| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 55%     | 60%     |
| SUSHI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |
| ZRX Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |

**Freezing KNCL**
The KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://www.notion.so/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://www.notion.so/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.

Considering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.

## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust thirteen (13) total risk parameters across eleven (11) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus.



## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations, the latest being [AIP-39: Risk Parameter Updates for Aave V2 assets](https://app.aave.com/governance/39-QmXQMnHQMP6KmwkCG8MjBCjxxNEeaHszh9FgFZFASkqPS2).


## Motivation

This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Volatility for non-stablecoin crypto assets remains high. As such, we focused on supporting protocol safety for our parameter changes in this cycle. 

Adjustments were also made for three liquidation bonus values. These assets (UNI, BAL, LINK) saw increases in liquidity and trading volume and a reduced liquidation recommended value as a result. As always, simulation recommended values seek to maintain capital efficiency and uphold borrow usage levels.  



## Specification

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 50%     |
| SNX Loan To Value     | 20%     | 30%     |

| DPI Loan To Value     | 60%     | 55%     |
| UNI Loan To Value     | 60%     | 55%     |
| UNI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.0%     |
| YFI Loan To Value     | 45%     | 50%     |
| BAL Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.0%     |
| LINK Liquidation Bonus     | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |
| BAT Liquidation Threshold    | 75.0%     | 80.0%     |
| ENJ Liquidation Threshold    | 60.0%     | 65.0%     |
| MANA Liquidation Threshold    | 65.0%     | 75.0%     |
| ZRX Liquidation Threshold    | 70.0%     | 75.0%     |


See below volatility and exchange volume data from 9/28 to 10/06 that were important drivers for the updated parameter recommendations.

It is important to note that these drivers give insight into why Gauntlet's simulations will output a new VaR calculation for a set of parameters, but each parameter can not be estimated by input changes. For example, the decrease in trading volume for DPI indicates lowered liquidity, while there are large increases for ENJ, MANA, and BAT. These suggest more liquidity and easier liquidations, but that relationship changes over time.

629,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-authorize-treasury-subdao-to-allocate-bal-to-turbo/2549).

# Motivation

Recently, Fei Labs announced [Tribe Turbo](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/the-tribe-dao-strongly-believes-that-a-healthy-and-thriving-defi-ecosystem-needs-a-robust-platform-b1faea700dfa), a way for DAO’s to issue Fei at no cost into Fuse pools of their choice. The Treasury subDAO has been evaluating this opportunity and believes there is likely market demand for users to borrow against their BPT’s (Balancer Pool Tokens) while still earning any BAL or other token incentives. Credit to Jared for preparing this helpful infographic which illustrates what will take place.

As part of the recent treasury swap with Fei, Balancer DAO has 2.45M FEI. As an initial allocation to gauge market demand, we propose to deposit 100k BAL into Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]) and borrow up to 10% of the current market value in FEI - we will also add 1M FEI from our current holdings for a total of ~1.1 - 1.2M FEI to be deposited into Fuse Pool [y].

The Treasury subDAO will monitor the health of the FEI loan against our 100k BAL and either add more BAL collateral or pay down the debt using our existing FEI holdings to protect against any possibility of liquidation.

The initial list of BPT’s users can deposit into Fuse Pool [y] will be wstETH/WETH, WBTC/WETH, WETH/DAI, WETH/BAL, WBTC/renBTC/sBTC, FEI/WETH, bbfUSD (Fuse boosted pool DAI/FEI/LUSD), and bbaUSD (Aave Boosted Pool DAI/USDC/USDT). As previously mentioned, any liquidity mining incentives will still be captured so users do not miss out on any yield by using Fuse Pool [y].

Since Tribe DAO has a lot of experience managing Fuse pools, the Treasury subDAO will let them manage Fuse Pool [y]. However, the Treasury subDAO will retain decision making authority around adding/removing BPT’s and setting the maximum LTV for each BPT. Any decision would be given to Tribe DAO to execute.

An important final consideration is that any FEI borrowed through Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]) is subject to an 80/20 split of the borrow interest with 80% going to Tribe DAO and 20% to Balancer DAO. Treasury subDAO has provided feedback that a 50/50 split would make increased usage of Turbo more palatable, though for now the 80/20 split remains the most likely reality. Credit to Jared again for this comparison of both revenue scenarios.

# KPI

Treasury subDAO is targetting a minimum of 50% utilization on borrowable FEI in Fuse Pool [y] as a sign that market demand does exist for borrowing against BPT collateral. This metric will be assessed 30 days after our deposit into Turbo to show either this is a worthwhile allocation of capital or we need to reconsider the value add. 

# Risks

* Turbo is a new product that, while audited, is untested. There is the possibility of a smart contract bug which causes a complete loss of our BAL deposited as collateral to Fuse Pool [x].
  * **Mitigation**: Tribe DAO has offered to give us an OTC insurance quote. This can be pursued if the Treasury subDAO feels it is appropriate.

* If utilization of FEI is very high in Fuse Pool [y] and the price of BAL drops very quickly, it may not be possible to withdraw FEI from Fuse Pool [y] to re-pay the FEI we borrowed from Fuse Pool [x]. This scenario could result in liquidation of the BAL we deposited to Fuse Pool [x].
  * **Mitigation**: Treasury subDAO should be prepared to add additional BAL collateral and/or use other liquid cash-equivalent assets in Balancer DAO’s treasury like USDC or FEI to re-pay the Fuse Pool [x] loan in an emergency. Additionally, it may take several days for the DAO Multisig to execute the necessary transaction(s) which must be factored in.
* Tribe DAO calls the loan in Fuse Pool [x]. This would trigger a four week period where Balancer DAO must repay the FEI we borrowed in full or risk the BAL collateral being seized.
  * **Mitigation**: Similar to the previous one. We cannot rely on being able to withdraw FEI from Fuse Pool [y] in such an emergency, so keeping cash-equivalent liquid assets ready to use in this kind of situation is important.
* Manipulation of the oracle that prices BPT in Fuse Pool [y]. This could result in an exploit that drains funds from Fuse Pool [y].
  * **Mitigation**: BPTs represent full range liquidity - previous instances of this manipulation in Fuse pools has been the result of relying on a Uniswap V3 oracle which represents concentrated liquidity in a specific range. Thus, the risk of this exploit should be very low. If it happens, we might lose the FEI we deposited to Fuse Pool [y] so we’d need to repay our FEI loan using our own funds.

# Specification

The Treasury subDAO already has the authority to farm with idle non-BAL assets, so only a social vote of the subDAO signers is required to allocate FEI from our current holdings into Fuse Pool [y]. In order to make use of Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]), we require authorization from BAL token holders to use some of the DAO’s BAL holdings.

**The Treasury subDAO requests that governance delegate us the power to allocate up to 500,000 BAL to Turbo (Fuse Pool [x]).** This will allow us to scale up from the initial deposit of 100,000 BAL if we deem it appropriate.

631,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. 

In addition, this ARC proposes adjusting two (2) total risk parameters, including LTV and Liquidation Threshold, across one (1) Aave Arc (Fireblocks) asset.

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Following the recent market crash, our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for LINK and WETH.** 

These parameter updates also represent Gauntlet's first set of parameter updates for the Aave Arc market.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification

Our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels.

## Aave Arc (Fireblocks) Parameter Changes Specification

Our simulation platform indicates that increasing the capital efficiency of USDC collateral does not meaningfully increase the risk of insolvencies. Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| USDC Loan To Value     | 85.5%     | 87.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Threshold     | 88%     | 90%     |




## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

Travala.com has published a proposal for the Venus community to integrate XVS as a payment option on their website. 

This partnership would provide significant benefits for the Venus community by expanding the utility of XVS in the real world through travel bookings. The marketing support and exposure provided by Travala, along with the convenience of booking with preferred cryptocurrencies, would further enhance the integration's appeal. 

Travala's established presence in the travel industry, with major partnerships and a Best Price Guarantee policy, offers a strong foundation for this collaboration. 

By leveraging Travala's platform, Venus can tap into a large user base that is already accustomed to using cryptocurrencies for travel bookings. The proposal's focus on boosting XVS's utility and accessibility aligns well with the strategic vision of both the Venus community and Travala. 

The initial support from Venus DAO to cover integration costs and marketing expenses demonstrates a commitment to driving the success of this partnership.",bearish

# Summary:

Enable a Balancer gauge for the PAR/EURA (ECLP-PAR-EURA) E-CLP with a 2% cap on Ethereum.

PAR is crypto-backed Euro stablecoin issued by the Parallel Protocol.

EURA is crypto-backed Euro stablecoin issued by the Angle Protocol.

The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP). E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.

# Protocol Description:

### Parallel Protocol

The Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol) is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon and Fantom. Stablecoins (PAR & paUSD) are decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro/USD fiat currency.

### Angle Protocol

Angle is a decentralized and over-collateralized stablecoin protocol composed of smart contracts running on open blockchains. It can be used to issue stablecoins designed to maintain the value of the assets they are pegged to.

EURA (previously agEUR), pegged to the value of the Euro - €. EURA holders can stake their stablecoins for stEUR in order to earn a native € yield.

# Motivation:

The role of the PAR/EURA E-CLP pool is to increase the stability of PAR, the on-chain liquidity of both PAR and EURA, connect the Parallel and Angle ecosystems.

The capital efficiency of E-CLPs will help to quickly increase the liquidity for PAR & EURA. This hub-and-spoke network will enable a more liquid secondary market for PAR & EURA to make it easier to exit from/ enter into PAR & EURA.

By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for PAR & EURA. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:

* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.

### A few notes:

* PAR (the Parallel EURO stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Polygon: [2eur (PAR)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x513cdee00251f39de280d9e5f771a6eafebcc88e000000000000000000000a6b)

635,"## Summary   
  

Aave Companies is proposing to the DAO the introduction of GHO, which was outlined in this initial proposal. 

 
With community approval, GHO can be launched on the Aave Protocol, allowing users to mint GHO against their supplied collaterals.   
  
GHO can be minted by users against a diversified set of crypto-assets. Borrowers of GHO will continue earning interest on the underlying supplied collateral, just as in all other borrow transactions on the Aave Protocol.   
  

If approved, the introduction of GHO will provide benefits for the community via the AaveDAO by sending 100% of interest payments on GHO borrows to the DAO.  
  

If approved and implemented through an AIP, GHO will be administered by Aave governance.  
 
It will be up to the AaveDAO to decide whether they are willing to support Aave Companies for the costs and work associated with GHO. 
 
## Community Feedback 
 
The community was very engaged with the GHO proposal, providing incredibly helpful and informative feedback. 
 

Some of the most notable feedback includes (but is not limited to): 
 

- Attention to potential pitfalls around DAO-set interest rates. 

- The importance of supply caps. 

- The value that a peg stability module could bring. 

- The necessity for properly vetting potential facilitators. 

 

This snapshot, if approved, will assign the Ethereum V2 Market on the Aave Protocol as the first facilitator for GHO, whilst also greenlighting the GHO proposal more generally, allowing for audits to take place in the context of broad community approval. It will be followed by a separate proposal that outlines a proposed strong starting state for GHO, which incorporates and builds upon the aforementioned feedback while helping to ensure that GHO is community driven from the get-gho. 

  

## Snapshot  
  

This preliminary Snapshot vote serves to:  
  
- Receive community approval for the pursuit of the GHO project.  

- Whitelist the Aave V2 Ethereum Market as the first facilitator for GHO. 
- Signal community approval to kick off discussions around starting parameters. 

 

Our proposal for this starting state will be informed by community feedback regarding the initial proposal and will aim to provide a strong initiation point for the AaveDAO to oversee GHOs development and parameters moving forward.",bullish

There are several solutions:

We will reach the management of pancake, they will allow me to withdraw earlier, even if at 100% loss of rewards

Users who can help - donate funds to me, and I extend steaking for a year and give the private wallet key to you

## Summary
Aave Arc is a “permissioned” version of the software underlying V2 of the Aave protocol that employs an additional smart contract layer to only allow “whitelisted” or “permissioned” users to engage with the protocol.

Fireblocks asks the Aave Governance community to approve the appointment, adoption, and authorization of Fireblocks LLC, a Fireblocks company, as a “whitelister” for one or more deployments of Aave Arc.

## Proposal
Fireblocks is on a mission to bring more institutional participants into DeFi.

Today, Fireblocks serves more than 600 customers and has secured over $1.25 trillion in digital assets. Fireblocks’ technology has become trusted by the leading institutional crypto players and the world’s biggest banks to secure digital assets, develop new yield generating strategies, and improve capital efficiency. As the initial whitelisting partner for Aave Arc, Fireblocks can offer institutions the same secure and scalable rails used to transfer and store digital assets to access permissioned DeFi environments.

DeFi is considered by institutional users to be one of the more complex markets to navigate across security, compliance, and risk perspectives. We are eager to be at the forefront of this transformational opportunity with Aave Arc by extending access to even our most compliance-conscious customers, who would otherwise avoid DeFi over compliance or regulatory concerns.

Fireblocks’ R&D, compliance, and legal teams have developed a new whitelister framework for permissioned DeFi. This framework meets both enterprise-grade requirements for accessing DeFi and adheres to Aave Arc’s whitelister governance criteria. This deployment will set the precedent for new organizations joining Aave Arc, simplify the process for onboarding new whitelisters, and ensure everyone is following best practices defined by the whitelister community.

AgEUR is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin minted by the Angle protocol. Users of the Angle Protocol can mint AgEUR by locking collateral in vaults.

For more information about AgEUR, please refer to [AgEUR Polygon V3 ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-ageur-on-aave-v3-on-polygon/7325).

This ARFC presents the Aave governance with an opportunity to onboard AgEUR to Aave Arbitrum V3 as a non-collateral asset.

## **Abstract**

This ARFC presents the Aave governance with an opportunity to onboard AgEUR to Aave Arbitrum V3 as a non-collateral asset.

## **Motivation**

AgEUR is the leading EUR-pegged decentralized stablecoin.

While the current market for EUR-pegged stablecoins is still anecdotal, the ACI supports stablecoin diversity in both the USD-pegged flavors and outside of USD-pegged assets.

AgEUR is designed to be efficient and can be minted at fair value using another stablecoin, which helps ensure that the peg remains resilient over time.

The proposed risk parameters are merely suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI is inviting Risk Service Providers to provide feedback on them.

649,"# ARC rationale

On February 16, 2023 at approximately 7 PM UTC, Platypus Finance, a stableswap protocol on Avalanche, was exploited through a flaw in its USP stablecoin solvency check mechanism and resulted in 9 million in stablecoins stolen from the users and pool depositors of the protocol in a series of three attacks.

In one of the three attacks, the attacker mistakenly implemented a logic in the exploit contract such that around $381k worth of stablecoins were directly transferred to Aave V3’s Pool contract deployed on Avalanche.

Currently, the Pool contract has implemented a `rescueTokens()` function, which will allow the function caller, who must be granted the `Pool_Admin` role in Aave V3’s access control system, to transfer any stuck ERC-20 tokens to designated addresses, including the stablecoins transferred to the Pool contract by the attacker.

This ARC is inspired by the previous discussions between Aave contributors, the Platypus team & its community, and various blockchain security organizations and individuals on the possible recovery of the funds sent to the Pool contract.

This ARC’s objective is to gather community sentiment and consensus to form and publish a formal AIP proposal vote for a community vote to approve the recovery actions on the stolen user assets stuck in the Pool contract.

To be discussed and decided:

* The technical implementation of the recovery actions: Platypus team and the Aave core contributors will work on a recovery contract to call the `rescueTokens()` function of the Pool contract and transfer the exploited funds stuck in the Pool contract to Platypus team’s multi-sig, subject to governance voting which will grant the recovery contract the `Pool_Admin` role access. The contract will follow Aave’s `StewardBase` pattern, which specifies the logic for handling Aave’s Pool access control logic and automatically renounce the admin roles once the recovery actions are fully executed.

# ARC content in short

* Platypus/ Aave team to deploy a recovery contract with the sole goal to recover exploited assets stuck in Aave V3’s Pool contract.
*  Aave community to vote on granting the recovery contract’s `Pool_Admin` permission to execute the recovery logic.
* Guardians to execute the permission grant should the voting is passed.
* Platypus/ Aave team to execute the recovery contract.

# Additional Information
To provide full transparency to the Aave community, we have also wrote a full analysis of the exploit where funds were drained to Aave’s Pool contract, along with all different amounts, addresses involved, and public analysis links included. We have also reached independent security firm BlockSec, to confirm the facts and legitimacy of our claim.

We have uploaded the relevant documents and have linked them below, where the first document is the analysis and our claim; and the second document is a verification statement signed by BlockSec:

650,"Summary

Quantstamp, Inc. has proposed a Security Partnership in the form of a Retainer Agreement to the Venus protocol.

The current planned list of audit priorities can be found below:

- Time-based contracts, needed for the deployment of Venus to Arbitrum or other networks where the block rate is not constant.
- Multichain governance, needed to allow Venus Governance to execute privilege commands on the new networks (Ethereum, opBNB, Arbitrum, Polygon zkEVM, etc.)
- wstETH oracle, needed for the deployment of the Liquid Staked ETH pool to Ethereum
- Cross-chain synchronization of the XVS voting power, taking into account the XVS staked into the vaults deployed to the different networks
- Seize of XVS rewards, allowing Venus Governance to seize XVS rewards from accounts like the BNB bridge exploiter and return them to the distribution wallet.
- VAI compatibility with Isolated pools, needed to deploy VAI to more networks

As Venus’s security partner, Quantstamp will provide Venus with 10 audit weeks worth of audit credits that may be used at any point during the year for auditing purposes. Each engagement in this retainer will be staffed with four (4) auditors and includes fix reviews and an in-depth review of both smart contract- and protocol-level security. The total cost is $130,000, which will be paid in four monthly installments of $32,500 in USDC from the Venus Treasury, with the first to be paid at the start of March 2024.

Partnership Scope

Quantstamp will provide the resources needed to perform ongoing security assessments of Venus’s codebase(s). If issues are found, Quantstamp will provide findings and options for Venus’s consideration as well as assistance to rewrite the code. Venus will be responsible for providing access to personnel, content, resources, systems, and information (including any consents, authorization, or licensing) as may be needed by Quantstamp to perform the activities under this partnership.

About Quantstamp

As a global team of security professionals, Quantstamp has honed our expertise by auditing hundreds of leading projects and serving as a trusted advisor for startups, governments, NGOs, and the private sector, performing more than 700 audits and securing over $200 billion in digital asset risk from hackers to date.",neutral
651,"Summary
The Venus Community proposes that Venus list the stablecoin FDUSD as a core lending market on Venus Core pool.

Rationale
$FDUSD is now becoming a well-established, liquid and widely recognized stablecoin in the BNBChain decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

Motivations
$FDUSD is a 1:1 backed stablecoin. The treasury is backed 100% by cash and cash equivalents (cash, overnight reverse repurchase agreements, and T-bills). There is no investment in any other assets. Reserves are actively managed and monthly attestations are published [here 2] by their team.

Stablecoins are designed to maintain a value pegged to a specific asset, such as the US dollar. By adding FDUSD, Venus can offer its users a new reliable and secure stablecoin that can be used for various transactions within the platform. Moreover, FDUSD can enhance the liquidity of the Venus core pool. The core pool serves as the fundamental liquidity provider for Venus, enabling users to borrow and lend different assets.

By incorporating FDUSD, Venus can broaden its pool of available assets, attracting more users and market participants. This increased liquidity can contribute to a more efficient and vibrant ecosystem. Additionally, the inclusion of FDUSD in the core pool will facilitate increased adoption and usage of Venus.

By offering FDUSD, Venus can tap into a larger user base that seeks stability and can leverage the platform for their needs. This would ultimately enhance the overall utility and attractiveness of Venus as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. Furthermore, FDUSD can serve as a hedge against market volatility. In times of heightened price fluctuations, stablecoins serve as a reliable store of value for users, preventing losses and preserving the purchasing power of their assets.

In summary, the addition of the FDUSD stablecoin to Venus core pool can bring stability, increased liquidity, broader adoption, and a safe haven for users. Incorporating FDUSD aligns with Venus goals of offering a robust, user-friendly, ever growing and inclusive DeFi platform.

Proposed Parameters
(As per Chaos Labs recommendations)

Collateral Factor
Considering the relatively short track record of FDUSD, ChaosLabs recommends starting with a more cautious Collateral Factor compared to USDT and USDC in the core pool, setting it at 75%.

Supply Cap and Borrow Cap
Applying Chaos Labs’ approach to setting initial supply caps for new assets, they propose setting the supply cap at 2X the on-chain liquidity available under the Liquidation Incentive (configured to 10%) price impact.

Given the current liquidity, they recommend an initial supply cap of 5,500,000 FDUSD.

IR Curves
We recommend setting the IR curve in line with those of the major stablecoins on the Venus Core pool:

Base - 0%
Kink - 80%
Multiplier - 6.875%
Jump Multiplier - 250%
Reserve factor - 10%

As for XVS emissions, the community recommends 10 XVS/Day as an initial incentive that can be later reviewed as the market grows in liquidity and utilization on Venus.",bullish
652,"**Title:** [TEMP CHECK] - Incentivized Delegate Campaign (3-month)

**Authors:** [@noturhandle](https://governance.aave.com/u/noturhandle) [@lajarre](https://governance.aave.com/u/lajarre) ([Butter](https://buttery.money/))

**Date:** 2023-04-03

## Summary

This Temperature Check has been created to enable the Aave community to select a delegate for the three-month incentivized Delegate Campaign organized by Butter.

The campaign will be funded by a $15k grant received in AAVE (~222 AAVE) from the Aave Grants DAO, which will be used to compensate the winning delegate for their efforts on behalf of tokenholders during the three-month term.

Thirteen candidates applied for the campaign—each will be presented as options in this proposal.

## The 3-month Incentivized Delegate Campaign

During the three-month term of the Delegate Campaign, the winning delegate is expected to perform governance duties on behalf of tokenholders. To ensure maximum alignment between the elected delegate and the voters, each candidate has been asked to produce a Delegate Initiative, which can be found [at this link](https://butterd.notion.site/Butter-d-Aave-Delegate-Initiatives-45e1ce2ac08a4b4298518b193ed8a7ce).

The Butter team will monitor the elected delegate and report on goals and KPIs related to the Delegate Initiative to help voters evaluate the delegate’s performance.

For the first pilot version of Butter’s Delegate Campaign program, the compensation mechanism is not yet permissionless. However, Butter will provide compensation on at least a monthly basis (or more frequently). More updates on this will be available soon.

## The Candidates

The candidates for the vote are listed below, in reverse alphabetical order.

653,"## Goal of the vote

0x Labs would like to gather signal from the community on whether or not there is support for on-chain governance as proposed in [ZEIP-95](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/95).

## Scope

The forum discussion on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-95-migrating-0x-protocol-to-on-chain-governance-process/3513](https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-95-migrating-0x-protocol-to-on-chain-governance-process/3513)

As described in the forum discussion, there would be a three-step process to the full transition to a new governance mechanism:

1. Deployment of the new governance smart contracts for initial calibration and testing
2. Migration period: ZRX holders can start registering to the new system
3. Vote to switch governance systems: 0x is fully controlled by new smart contracts

This snapshot vote will only give signal on the community’s sentiment with step 1. 

If sentiment is favorable, 0x Labs will continue to develop and deploy the system of smart contracts that define a new governance mechanism — the technical implementation can be found open sourced [here](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/95).

A subsequent vote (ZEIP-95) will be required to officially switch ownership of the `exchangeProxy` contract to a new governance mechanism, completing the transition.

657,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes SingularityDAO ($SDAO) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with SingularityDAO! SingularityDAO is a project utilizing AI–powered DeFi portfolios, with products such as [**DynaSets**](https://singularitydao.ai/dynasets/).

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn SDAO tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 350,000 SDAO
 - **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 04 Jul 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 03 Aug 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.4050 SDAO 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the SDAO Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a SDAO-BUSD farm. The farm will have 0.5x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.1x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the farm period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.

#### What is $SDAO?

From the team: “SingularityDAO is a DeFi Protocol designed to provide returns that is agnostic towards market trends. This is achieved by utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and tapping upon the experiences of professional traders in the team.


The SDAO token provides the following utilities: governance; fee sharing (from DynaSets performance fees); launchpad access; staking rewards; and liquidity mining.”

## Summary
This vote asks for approval from the community on 3 interdependent projects developed together within the Aave <> BGD Labs scope: Aave Governance v3, a.DI (Aave Delivery Infrastructure) and Aave Robot v3.

## Context
One of the main developments included into the Aave <> BGD Labs engagement was the next iteration of the governance system of Aave: v3.

In order to enable it, being heavy on cross-chain communication, we have also developed a.DI, a cross-chain communication abstraction layer of smart contracts.
Additionally, an instance of the already approved Aave Robot will be deployed for Governance v3, as layer of permissionless automation.
All of them, and specially Aave Governance and a.DI are inter-dependant.

Extensive information about the 3 components can be found on the following links, including architecture, flows, voting assets or initial underlying bridge providers, amongst others:

- [Aave Robot](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-robot-v1/13091)

## The proposal
Even within the Aave <> BGD Labs engagement context, this vote tries to follow good procedures on the community and ask for pre-approval on all the ideas exposed on the previously linked posts, for them to be official.

# Simple Summary

This ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) finishes at a further 30% reduced rate.

In addition to tapering incentives on the Aave V2 market, the ARC proposes introducing incentives on the Aave ARC market. 10% of the 30% reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 ethereum market are to be applied to incentivising AUM on the Aave ARC Ethereum market.

# Abstract

Liquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG), renewed by [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) and then incentives were reduced by 30% with the implementation of [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) which expires on the 20th February 2022. A summary is shown below.

* AIP-X: 46.2 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market

Continuing on from AIP-47, incentives on low vol assets are to be split 1:2 in favour of borrowers over lenders. This logic will be applied to both Aave V2 and ARC markets. High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.

# Motivation

This proposal continues on from AIP-47 with a further 30% tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior [ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946) and shall last for another proposed 90 day period. We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market.

The incentive APR will fall, even though TVL has reduced with market conditions so has AAVE’s token price.

In addition to incentivising Aave V2 Ethereum market, I would like to present to the community an opportunity to commence distributing stkAAVE incentives on the Aave ARC market with the intention of achieving the following:

1. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)
2. Increase liquidity
3. Attractive (low) borrow rates
4. Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor
5. Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform

Within this proposal we will present two options for the Aave ARC markets, Option 2) will reflect a Total Value Locked in Aave ARC of $250M. This represents a 12.6x increase in TVL from what is a low base. The next iteration of liquidity mining will likely see an increased allocation to Aave ARC as we continue to encourage users to interact with the market. The initial target here is to grow Aave ARV to over $250M within the next 90 days and then pivot as required to support continual growth of the market.

# Specification

The below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 21.02.2021 up to and including 20.05.2022.

Key changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign:

* 30% reduction in incentives to 1,078 stkAAVE per day on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* Introduction of 26.2 stkAAVE per day on Aave ARC Ethereum market
* Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value

The table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave V2 Ethereum market asset listings. In estimating the Borrowing vAPR, a 75% utilisation of the deposited assets was assumed. This was based on the current DAI utilisation.

![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/d/d2ff417f056b6dd50b32d389b8167c92d86a39d4_2_1380x984.png ""Chart"")
Note: TVL per token is as per the 3rd February 2022.

The table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave ARC market asset listings.

Option 1) Same Methodology as above allocating 10% of the reduction in Aave V2 Ethereum Market stkAAVE incentives. Ie: 10% of (1,540-1,078)

Option 2) Similar methodology to the above with an assumed market size of $250M and distribution across the assets of 60% USDC, 20% ETH and 10% of both wBTC and AAVE.

Asset Value Deposited Multiplier Daily stkAAVE Incentive LM Allocation (%) LM Incentive Split (%) LM vAPR (%)

Mathematics: % of value deposited x multiplier then scaled to provide LM Allocation that totals 100%. [Link here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trx6tYr1jy5Izs-IfPTrGCp1y6EExCgyu4P8pme_Y_8/edit?usp=sharing)

# Rationale

The previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal. The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC reflects a desire to grow this mainnet market. Incentivising the Aave ARC market is funded from the reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1,540 to 1,124.2 stkAAVE per day.

Aarve ARC Option 1) we show what impact allocating 10% of the savings from the reduced Aave V2 Ethereum market would look like following a similar allocation strategy to the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The mathematics assumes 75% utilisation of lending pools capital is borrowed which reflects the current utilisation of the DAI pool on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. With zero wBTC deposited in the market, and still very low capital being deposited, this approach is heavily skewed towards USDC and mis represents what is expected with time.

Aave ARC Option 2) we elected to view the incentives in line with $250M and assumed a distribution across the pools. The distribution is an assumption and is quite different to the existing distribution on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. We can easily change these parameters and are happy to do so. The high level logic is to anticipate capital being deposited and then estimating what the vAPR from incentives would equate to. For this we assumed $250M which is arbitrarily chosen as a nice round target, it represents over 10x growth in the market TVL.

# Discussion

The previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets. Link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946). Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market, large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing. (Lending vAPY, - borrowing vAPR, + Borrowing Incentives vAPR, + Lending vAPY)

With the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas. Time in the pool is also a huge factor, and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so. However, it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now. Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions. The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider.

With the introduction of incentives on Aave ARC, even with around $250M deposited 60% in USDC, the strategy would be profitable with a 75% utilisation rate. This risks assets currently deposited in the Aave V2 Ethereum market being reallocated to the Aave ARC market. If this was to occur the vAPR from incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market would increase. It will be interesting to see what effect this has on the value deposited in each pool. Pending how the market reacts to these proposed changes, we can always revisit this and propose an amendment to the distribution schedule across both markets.

## Economics

* Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $44.5K per day during late January 2022. Daily aToken interest is around $1.9K per day.
* Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $168,630 per day assuming 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Down from $231,000 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Note, previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of $320.
* Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $296.89M with an AAVE price of $150.
* 90 days at 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token is $15.18M or around 5.11% of the Ecosystem Reserve.
* The Net spend is $122K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE/day Safety Module incentives
* Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions. Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue.

Further details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community. Please note, each query will need to be run separately.

**Title:** [ARFC] Emission Manager Framework Update 
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-03-08

---
## Motivation

In the current market dynamic, with incentives programs becoming increasingly popular among protocols looking to collaborate, the existing framework for adding new emission managers to Aave pool reserves is considered unnecessary complex and lengthy. Given the general consensus in favor of incentives programs, it is challenging to consider a proposal that would fail to gain community support.

The current onboarding process involves:

| Step | Duration | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Publish ARFC on forum | 5 days | Seek feedback from the community |
| Snapshot vote | 4 days | Gather consensus and obtain a YAE outcome |
| AIP publication | 5 days | Reach consensus and implement the new role |

Assuming perfect sync and seamless governance, this minimum two-week timeframe is deemed inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose updating the framework to incorporate emission admins into the ""Direct-to-AIP"" framework.

## Specification

### Proposed Changes:

1. Incorporate emission admins into the ""Direct-to-AIP"" framework, enabling direct escalation of proposals to the AIP stage following publication on the forum.
2. Pre-authorize the inclusion of an emission admin as part of either an ad-hoc steward or current risk steward role to facilitate a more efficient and streamlined onboarding process.

## Next Steps

1. Community feedback and gather consensus on the proposed changes.
2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.
3. If successful, escalate to AIP (Aave Improvement Proposal) stage for implementation.

## Disclaimer

This proposal is made independently by the ACI.

**Title:** [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 deployment on BNB Chain.

**Author:** @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative

**Date:** 2023-03-22
- --

## **Simple Summary**

This Temperature Check seeks community input on the possibility of deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain to expand Aave's presence and tap into BNB Chain's growing DeFi ecosystem and user base.

## **Background**

BNB Chain is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. With a TVL of approximately $5 billion, BNB Chain is the third-largest chain by TVL. The chain has a diverse array of DeFi offerings, including prominent projects like PancakeSwap, Venus, and several others. Deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities.

## **Motivation**

Deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain has the potential to benefit both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and the potential for additional revenue. BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.

## **Specification**

This TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT. Suggested risk parameters for each asset are provided in the table below. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.

## **Disclaimer**

The Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.
At the time of writing, the author owns ~75$ worth of assets on the BNB chain.

## **Next Steps**

Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain.

ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.

AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.",neutral
675,"As we continue to optimize CAKE rewards across all of our deployments, we are able to gradually lower the overall CAKE emission, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to facilitate a smooth trading experience. Ultimately, this enables us to contribute a greater amount of CAKE towards the weekly burn. 

Given PancakeSwap’s positive market growth across our v3 deployments as well to keep our Farms’ APR competitive against other liquidity venues, this proposal aims to decrease CAKE emission to Farms across all chains.

The previous round of [**Adjustments to Farm Rewards**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0xc3c48f2e4de3916bb5ad4d54681658b4a3940525dd1bf23eadc82aa3f3fa8ae0) increased the overall CAKE burn by approximately **1,150 CAKE per day** with minimal impact to trading volumes. This proposal aims to decrease emissions and increase the overall CAKE burn by approximately **4,000 CAKE per day**.

As time passes, this optimization will help to 1) improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across Farms and 2) continue to make CAKE deflationary.

#### Adjustment Details

With the above in mind, we are proposing to apply the following adjustments:
1. Reduce Farm emissions by 12.5% across all 8 chains (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Aptos, zkSync, Base, Arbitrum, Linea, and Polygon zkEVM)
2. BNB Chain’s core Farms will have their CAKE emissions reduced by 17.5% instead (including: BNB-USDT, BNB-BUSD, BUSD-USDT, USDC-USDT, USDC-BUSD, CAKE-BNB, CAKE-USDT, BTC-BUSD, BTC-USDT, ETH-USDT, BTC-BNB, ETH-BNB, and BTC-ETH)
3. Direct all the reduced CAKE emissions to increase our weekly burn

## Summary

This Temperature Check aims to provide general background information on the Celo blockchain and seeks the community’s input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Celo, an emerging [L2 on Ethereum 3](https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109).

## Motivation

As detailed in the Background section below, the Celo ecosystem offers a unique value proposition featuring real-world usage and ReFi. As Aave will be given a prominent role on Celo, this deployment offers Aave differentiated expansion and revenue opportunities.

1. A deployment on Celo expands AAVE’s utility and user base to a unique population of Celo’s mobile-first community which has [grown significantly](https://dune.com/springzhang/celo-blockchain-overview) over the past few months led by key launches that have brought in returning real-world users in emerging markets.
2. Aave will be heavily utilized for real-world DeFi and ReFi use cases, particularly in emerging markets given Celo’s growing presence in these regions led by protocols like GoodDollar and Grassroots Economics.
3. **The Celo Foundation will allocated 0.5% of CELO circulating supply as an incentive for Aave users to support the adoption and bootstrap growth on Celo.** This deployment will bring new users to the Aave platform and reach more users from the Celo community. The Celo Foundation can also support Aave DAO in setting up a verified node for the Celo network (subject to technical requirements being met and voting by the community) for which Celo can provide a grant.
4. The [Mento protocol](https://www.mento.org/) on Celo proposed returning 120M CELO to the Celo Community Fund, which the Celo community has expressed interest in placing in Aave to boost on-chain liquidity for CELO (pending a governance process). More details [here](https://forum.celo.org/t/mento-reserve-returning-celo/5236). Additionally, they proposed a $10M CELO / wETH pool on Uniswap which is expected to pass through Celo governance.
5. In the long-term, this Celo x AAVE deployment has the potential opportunity to expand into natural capital-backed assets such as tokenized carbon credit and other ReFi assets (conditional upon rigorous liquidity and credit assessments by Chaos Labs and others).

## Background

Celo is an open-source, mobile-first EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, on a mission to foster an inclusive financial system for everyone. With an ecosystem thriving on [9.4M addresses, around 1M daily transactions](https://celoscan.io/)[~500,000 monthly active wallets](https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/stats),[and over 234M transactions](https://celoscan.io/) since inception, Celo sets the stage for real-world applications from day one. Celo has been one of the fastest-growing blockchains over the past few months.

**Source: Nansen**

### **Key Features:**

**Mobile Accessibility**: Utilizes a decentralized phone verification protocol and SNARK-based light clients such as Plumo 1 for mobile-friendly operations.

**Flexible Assets**: Celo offers native stablecoins in the form of Mento stable assets (cUSD, cEUR, cREAL), which are eligible for transaction fees. CELO itself natively supports the ERC20 interface, eliminating the need for wrapped versions.

**Regenerative Finance**: Committed to regenerative finance, Celo is carbon-negative, offsetting over eight times its carbon footprint. An upcoming proposal, the [Ultragreen Money](https://www.ultragreen.money/), looks to further push Celo’s green initiatives.

**Real World Usage:** CELO TVL continues to grow and is at [193M CELO](https://defillama.com/chain/Celo?currency=CELO) showing continued locking of assets into Celo DeFi protocols. Additionally, Celo has been chosen by [Kickstarter](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/08/kickstarter-to-start-blockchain-based-crowdfunding-project-report/) for its upcoming decentralized product (to date, Kickstarter has successfully supported over [214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats)) and [Deutsche Telekom](https://blog.celo.org/celo-deutsche-telekoms-partnership-strengthens-with-the-global-launch-of-t-challenge-bd102f07b572) which will attract new users to the ecosystem.

The Celo ecosystem emphasizes real-world applications—real-world usage has been the core focus since day 1 of the blockchain. Several of the many solutions actively being used by people around the world on the Celo blockchain include the following:

- UBI: GoodDollar has over [130,000 monthly beneficiaries 1](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/celo?period=month) around the world.
- Community Currency: Grassroots Economics has [over 20,000 active users](https://viz.sarafu.network/) across Kenya and South Africa
- Digital Microwork: The Celo Foundation initially piloted digital microwork with [Mercy Corps Ventures](https://www.mercycorps.org/research-resources/potential-cryptocurrency-kenya-youth) and today Jumptask has over [40,000 users](https://celoscan.io/token/0x1d18d0386f51ab03e7e84e71bda1681eba865f1f) on Celo
- Climate action: [Plastiks](https://plastiks.io/) recently partnered with FC Barcelona on a [climate-focused NFT launch](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/3505122/fc-barcelona-launches-its-first-nft-collection-in-association-with-plastiks) and [Ecosapiens](https://www.ecosapiens.xyz/) debuted their new [enterprise climate collectible](https://nftnow.com/news/exclusive-ecosapiens-debuts-corporate-climate-collectibles-on-celo/) on Celo. [Toucan](https://toucan.earth/) protocol, [Carbonpath](https://www.carbonpath.io/), and [CarbonTerra](https://carbonterra.com/) offer on chain carbon credit retirements. Additionally, the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/) continues to remain a leader in the industry driving web3 solutions for solving the climate crisis.
- Real-world lending: [EthicHub](https://www.ethichub.com/en/) supports 21 smallholder farming communities in Mexico, Brazil, and Honduras for uncollateralized lending. The [Credit Collective](https://forum.celo.org/t/credit-collective-hello-world/5789) is currently seeding liquidity into new impact-driven lending and RWA protocols on Celo with members including [impactMarket 1](https://www.impactmarket.com/), [Flowcarbon](https://www.flowcarbon.com/), [Huma Finance 1](https://huma.finance/), and [Canza Finance](https://canza.io/).
- Native mobile offramps: Through [FiatConnect 1](https://fiatconnect.org/), an API standard for web3 wallets to integrate with cash-in/cash-out providers, Celo users will be able to natively onramp and offramp through mobile wallets. In its initial activation, [Valora](https://valoraapp.com/) wallet users across 20 countries can now leverage this technology.
- Social impact and mobile gaming: The Celo Foundation partnered with [Animoca](https://www.animocabrands.com/animoca-brands-joins-celo-ecosystem-to-accelerate-web3-adoption) on mobile-first and social impact gaming. Engagements include Animoca serving as a validator and [climate education](https://twitter.com/TinyTapAB/status/1684485236200026112) with [TinyTap](https://www.start.tinytap.com/publisher-nft).

**Integration with Ethereum**: cLabs recently [proposed 3](https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109) that Celo return home to Ethereum by transitioning from an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer 2. Following months of research by the cLabs team as well as initial discussions among core Celo and Ethereum community members, the cLabs team detailed an architecture in which the Celo blockchain becomes an Ethereum L2, with key differentiators including

- Decentralized sequencer powered by Celo’s existing validator set running Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus.
- Off-chain data availability layer, powered by EigenLayer and EigenDA, operated by Ethereum node operators, and protected by restaked ETH. EigenDA brings the design of danksharding to Ethereum early, enabling Celo to maintain its low fees.
- A design that retains Celo’s 1-block finality.

This proposal was [overwhelmingly approved](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/116) by the Celo ecosystem in a temperature check to continue this work.

**Security**: The chain consensus is Proof of Stake with validators taking delegation. There is no multisignature contract that can change the network. On-chain governance proposals and hard-forks are the only ways to make changes to the network. The Smart Contract was audited by [OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/celo-contracts-audit/) and a Security Audit was conducted by [Trailofbits](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PEjoN_wn--OWwzOcolAUGimBjqFjEecNSSQwL6i0y3Q/edit). There is also a formal verification of Celo governance protocols by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CeloMay2020.pdf).

**Native Mobile Solutions**: [FiatConnect 1](https://fiatconnect.org/) allows Celo users to natively handle onramps and offramps through mobile wallets in multiple countries.

Emphasizing global utility, Celo has been a touchstone for decentralized solutions worldwide. From UBI, community currencies, and digital microwork, to climate action, Celo propels web3 solutions with a real-world impact.

## Specification

### Risk Parameters

Chaos Labs advised us on initial parameter recommendations, given the current liquidity levels on Celo. **Please note that these recommendations would be updated closer to launch.** We encourage other risk managers for updated analyses post temperature check. Crucially, the metrics below **do not** include a [governance proposal 1](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/121) in which $10M of liquidity is proposed by the Celo ecosystem for a CELO / wETH pool on Uniswap.

Based on current liquidity levels, **we believe a Metis-type of initial deployment would be most suitable—the emphasis here being the Celo blockchain’s real-world and social impact use cases**. Over time, we expect we can continue to increase caps as the Celo blockchain grows through the development of more real-world use cases and the transition to an L2 on Ethereum.

681,"#### ABSTRACT

This AIP proposes the re-evaluation of Special Council salaries from [AIP-1 ](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-1-proposing-the-dao-process/39) with an immediate salary adjustment for future Special Council members, suggesting a 50% reduction in their compensation (from $20,833 of ApeCoin/month to $10,417 of ApeCoin/month). This adjustment will be applicable to all future terms as detailed in [AIP-137 ](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-137-the-special-council-nomination-process/8849) and [AIP-138](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-138-the-special-council-election-process/8850), exclusively affecting Special Council members elected after the implementation of this proposal.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

Financially, the DAO stands to accrue savings of up to $104,165 ApeCoin monthly. It will also elevate community engagement by granting ApeCoin holders the opportunity to vote on this delicate matter, enhancing the overall governance.

#### OVERALL COST

$0. No costs for the ApeCoin DAO. Instead it will save the DAO up to $104,165 ApeCoin/month.

682,"# Problem
It has been brought to the notice of the Swerve Community that a lot of users who are actively involved both in Curve, and Swerve communities are being banned from Curve Discord without a justification. Some of them are being banned even for simple participation in dialogue on Swerve Discord server.

This is an unjustifiable mode of censorship that should not be a part of any community within crypto ecosystem. The blockchain ecosystem is built on the core values of openness, transparency and censor-ship resistant participation, both in what goes on on-chain as well as off-chain.

I believe this action of Curve moderators executing unilateral bans on active participants of Swerve community are a significant step back from the core values of the ecosystem.
# Solution
Curve team/moderators/community should embrace transparency and criticism. They should stop limiting access to information, putting up barriers to community participation, and shun censorship as a mode of community management.

While it would be great if the core team of Curve strives to also bring transparency to their operations, this proposal does not apply to it.

# Proposal
As an immediate response to the passing of this proposal this proposal seeks to request the Curve moderators to reverse the bans on members who have been banned for Curve discord simply be committing the crime of participating in discourse on Swerve Discord.

Should the Curve team reverse the bans on users active in Swerve discord?",bearish

As you may have seen, Synthetix [recently addressed](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/medium-severity-bug-found/3161/9) the 'Medium Severity Bug' identified last month. The team at Balancer Labs has put a contract together that will move the affected funds from the 'ProtocolFeeCollector' back to the Vault which will restore normal operation. I propose executing this contract as soon as possible.

### Specification

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction to the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling `grantRoles` with the arguments:

title: [ARFC] Ethereum v2 Reserve Factor Adjustment
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic @ChaosLabs
created: 2024-02-27

---

# Summary

This publication proposes periodically increasing the Aave v2 Ethereum Reserve Factor (RF) to encourage users to migrate to Aave v3.

# Motivation

With Aave v3 now crossing the $8 Billion TVL threshold and $3 Billion remaining in Aave v2, this publication seeks to encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3 by increasing the RF.

With all other variables held constant, increasing the RF over time in isolation will result in a reducing deposit rate. Users are encourage to migrate to v3 in search of higher yield.

With market conditions permitting, we propose initiating a periodic 5.00% RF increase across all assets every 14 days as mentioned [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766) up to a threshold of 99.99%. During each increase cycle, we will monitor how users respond and, if any potential risks are identified, the next RF increase will be delayed until it is safe to implement.

Do note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect users' health factor, and this method has already been [implemented on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350) for some time. 

# Specification

The below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.

686,"[ARFC] MaticX Supply Cap Increase in Polygon V3

Author: Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)

Date: 2024-01-30

# **Summary**

This proposal aims to increase the MaticX Supply Cap on Polygon V3 to match market demand.

# **Motivation**

Increasing the supply cap of Polygon MaticX in the Aave market is a strategic move to accommodate growing demand, and follow a previous DAO decision to maintain aggressive supply caps for correlated assets. 

Deposits of MaticX have been over 95% of the supply cap for some time. Increasing the Supply Cap will enable users to continue depositing MaticX and enter the recursive MaticX/wMATIC yield strategy. 

The DAO has previously voted to allow assets with correlated borrow supply caps to be up to 75% of cumulative supply. Since this exceeds the supply cap increase allowable by risk stewards, this proposal will increase supply caps through the typical ARFC process. Current circulating supply is over 100M, so this proposal will increase the supply cap to 75M.

# **Specification**

Increase the supply cap for MaticX on Polygon V3 to the following. 

| Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SupplyCap | 62M | 75M |

687,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allow-whitelist-tetubal-in-balancer-votingescrow/2722)


### Summary
This is a proposal to hear from the Balancer community about the whitelisting of Tetu contracts for the new product being developed, which is called tetuBAL.

### What is tetuBAL?
tetuBAL is the liquid version of veBAL being developed by Tetu. Each tetuBAL represents veBAL locked forever in a 1:1 ratio.

With tetuBAL users will be able to:

* Deposit 80/20 BAL and ETH on veBAL forever in exchange for tetuBAL.
* Sell tetuBAL for BAL in the liquidity pool.
* Participate in governance votes using dxTETU to target Balancer emissions.
* Exposure to veBAL that is on the Ethereum network with a low cost of gas due to the aggregation of assets.
* veBAL rewards earnings from the maximum 1 year locking period, swap fees, and protocol fees while receiving the boost that is only available on Ethereum.

### Governance
All governance discussions take place through Discord, if there is an implicit community consensus the proposal is carried out and dxTETU holders can vote. Eventually, when the will of the community is unclear, draft proposals are submitted for review and amendment prior to publication of the original proposal.

### Audits and Security
All audits can be found here https://docs.tetu.io/tetu-io/security/audits

Tetu's security features are 48 hours Time lock and MultiSig Wallet, more information can be seen in the docs. Tetu uses security best practices such as rigorous testing before implementing new code.

688,"#### Proposal to Direct CAKE Emissions to Locker Protocols
![](https://i.imgur.com/B8wbReP.jpg)

In order to help bootstrap the veCAKE ecosystem and improve CAKE incentive efficiency, The Kitchen is proposing to redirect a portion of current CAKE emissions to participate in the veCAKE locker ecosystem (i.e., provide CAKE as bribes for strategic pools).

**Note:** no increase in overall CAKE emissions will occur under this proposal. Strategic pools include high volume and revenue driving pools such as: BNB-USDT, USDT-USDC, BTC-USDT, BNB-ETH, ETH-USDT, among others.

#### Summary: Redirection of CAKE Emissions to Bribes

The Kitchen is proposing to make the following modifications to current CAKE emissions:
* Reduce current emissions going to farming pools by 500 CAKE per day (from ~29,184 to ~28,684 CAKE per day).
* Allocate this 500 CAKE per day to participate in locker protocol bribes
* If this is successful in directing greater emissions to high volume pools to grow liquidity, then the Kitchen may request a larger amount in the future. The Kitchen will track these efforts to determine success based on pool volumes, TVL, and capital efficiency.
* This will not impact the deflationary status of CAKE as no emissions have been added or removed, only redirected.

How bribes will be allocated:
* The Kitchen will allocate bribes on a per epoch basis (i.e., every 14 days).
* The bribes will be distributed between any locker protocol built on veCAKE, including Cakepie, StakeDAO, and Hidden Hand.
* Bribe allocation will be based on bribe efficiency to get the best return on CAKE used in this effort. If the difference in bribe efficiency between locker protocols is within 10% of each other, then bribes will be split evenly among them to maximize value across the ecosystem and minimize risk. 

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and a portion of CAKE will be redirected to bribe across locker protocols.",neutral

After the vote against AIP-4&5, the community had meaningful discussions on the ApeCoin DAO forum and elsewhere. The essential feedback was that overall the framework was fine, but lacked the key element of caps.

This AIP proposes a staking system for ApeCoin and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT ecosystem: Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC). Staking participants will be able to stake ApeCoin and use the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem NFTs to receive ApeCoin from a preset pool over a set period of time.

Enable gauges for the OHM-ETH & OHM-DAI pools. 

**References/Useful links:**


    • Website: https://www.olympusdao.finance/


**Protocol Description:**
Olympus is building OHM, a community-owned, decentralized and censorship-resistant reserve currency that is asset-backed, deeply liquid and used widely across Web3.

**Motivation:**
As part of the Olympus RBS launch, the OHM-DAI-ETH pool has been equally split into two new pools, OHM-DAI & OHM-ETH as to simplify the conduction of  market operations by the Olympus Treasury under this new Range-Bound System. Since migrating the bulk its liquidity onto Balancer, the OHM pool has been one of the top pools in terms of volume generated, greatly contributing to the total revenues accruing to veBAL holders. Olympus DAO would like to explore different ways to attract additional and/or external liquidity for these two pools by enabling gauges. The gauge for the OHM-DAI-ETH pool should also be disabled as the Olympus Treasury is expecting to migrate fully out of it in the coming days. 

**Specifications:**
1. OlympusDAO is currently using snapshot for Governance: [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/olympusdao.eth)
Treasury [multisig](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/contracts/treasury) 4 of 8: Holds Olympus Treasury assets

5. **Market History:** 
OlympusDAO expects these two new pools to remain one of the highest revenues drivers for the Balancer ecosystem.

### Additional Specification

Included in this proposal is the removal of the OHM/DAI/WETH gauge.

If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the `AuthorizerAdaptor` at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call `performAction` using `0xab8f0945` for the `data(bytes)` argument and `0x852CF729dEF9beB9De2f18c97a0ea6bf93a7dF8B` for the `target(address)` argument.

`0x852CF729dEF9beB9De2f18c97a0ea6bf93a7dF8B` corresponds to the gauge contract for OHM/DAI/WETH.",bullish
701,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-empower-ballers-to-allocate-bal-to-polygon/1964).

Polygon (MATIC) has seen strong user adoption this year with major DeFi projects like Aave, Sushi, and Curve all deploying there. The time has come for Balancer to join the party. The polygon team has agreed to pledge $5M worth of MATIC as rewards over the course of 8 weeks to be allocated at our discretion. Balancer Labs has taken care of deployment logistics and with the approval of BAL voters we can jump start liquidity with BAL + MATIC incentives. This proposal would allow the Ballers to allocate BAL + MATIC incentives to chosen Balancer pools on polygon. To match polygon’s $5M worth of MATIC, I propose we begin with a 25,000 BAL per week allocation which can be adjusted in the future at the discretion of the Ballers but not reduced below 25,000 until the initial 8 week matching period has completed. These 25,000 BAL would come from the fixed 145,000 weekly issuance, reducing the total L1 incentive to 120,000 rather than increasing BAL inflation.

**Motivation**

Other polygon deployments have been wildly successful. Recently Sushi has done more volume on polygon than ETH mainnet (check [this thread](https://twitter.com/RaphaelSignal/status/1406234551618244611) and [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mhonkasalo/status/1406181121562398723)). Balancer brings a unique primitive to polygon by being the only flexible AMM. Forthcoming features like the stable swap factory will give us additional competitive advantages on polygon compared to ETH mainnet where similar products exist in the market. Based on my analysis of Sushi’s metrics, I believe we can also expect to exceed fees earned on ETH mainnet after a few weeks go by on polygon.

The Ballers plan to focus on multi-asset pools with higher fees and potentially building partnerships with polygon native projects. Any community input about pool composition or projects worth connecting with is greatly appreciated (#governance in discord).

25,000 is a sizable commitment but the potential opportunity is significant. I strongly believe we can generate more fees per BAL spent on polygon than we can with our current strategy on ETH mainnet.

**Specification**

If approved, the Ballers will immediately begin designing pools and assigning the BAL + MATIC rewards. As mentioned, the MATIC rewards would last for 8 weeks ($5M total over 8 weeks) and a minimum of 25,000 BAL per week would last for 8 weeks. After that, the Ballers can decide to adjust that number up or down (with community input!).

The goal is to vote this weekend and begin incentives on the 28th - pending any community discussion of course.",bullish

Title: [ARFC] - Remove ARB from Isolation mode on Arbitrum Market
Authors: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
Date: 2024-02-21
___


# Summary
This publication proposes disabling Isolation Mode for ARB on Aave v3 Arbitrum.

# Motivation
Since the ARB airdrop, April 2023, the Arbitrum ecosystem has experienced exponential like growth and the ARB liquidity has improved significantly.

With the support of the Risk Service providers, this proposal is to disable Isolation Mode and enable ARB to be used in combination with other assets as collateral.

# Specification:
**Ticker:** ARB
**Contract Adress:** [0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548)
**Chainlink Oracle:** [0xb2A824043730FE05F3DA2efaFa1CBbe83fa548D6](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb2A824043730FE05F3DA2efaFa1CBbe83fa548D6)

This will remove ARB from isolation mode, keeping the current risk parameters.


# Next Steps
If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage

**Summary:**

>This pool uses the ComposableStablePoolFactory-v5 which addresses the [reentrancy vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345) disclosed during February 2023. This gauge is uncapped.
>
>This proposal is for a new pool GHO/LUSD to be created on Ethereum.

**Protocol Description:**

>*Aave Protocol*
The Aave Protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol that is deployed across many EVM compatible networks including but not limited to Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche and Polygon. Currently, the Aave Protocol has a TVL of approximately $7.8 Billion.
>
>*Liquity Protocol*
Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD - USD-pegged stablecoin and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%. LUSD has proved its impeccable resilience in time by getting through severe market crashes untroubled. Currently, the Liquity Protocol has a TVL of approximately $678m. 

**Motivation:**

>GHO is a decentralized multi-collateral stable coin that is fully backed, transparent and native to the Aave Protocol. 
>
>Further details relating to GHO can be found [here](https://gho.xyz/). 
>
>LUSD is the Liquity protocol stable coin. It uses ETH only as collateral. And LQTY is the secondary token issued by Liquity, capturing the fee revenue. Furthermore, LQTY stakers earn ETH and LUSD as rewards. And LUSD Stability pool depositors that earn LQTY and ETH. 
>
>Further details relating to LUSD can be found [here](https://docs.liquity.org/).

**Specifications:**

>1. **Governance:** 
>
>* AAVE and stkAAVE serve as the governance tokens for the Aave DAO. Holders can vote on proposals at both a Snapshot level and through the Aave DAO [on-chain governance portal](https://app.aave.com/governance/).
>* Liquity has no governance. It is built to maximize trustlessness and decentralization.

4. **Centralization vectors:** 
>* Aave Governance is decentralized, and all changes must go through a transparent and well-tested governance process. 
>* Liquity is built to have maximized resilience, so no centralization vectors.

5. **Market History:** 
>* GHO is yet to be released by the Aave DAO.
>* For LUSD, there can be a small premium on LUSD results from a structural unbalance between offer and demand. The situation led to a considerable demand surge for censorship-resistant stablecoins that only LUSD can answer since there is no other alternative with a significant TVL. Nevertheless, hard peg mechanisms are built into the system between $1 and $1.10, and soft peg incentives in between. Further, Chicken Bonds are also helping to reduce the stablecoin premium, and this effect will strengthen as the protocol grows.

6. **Value:**
>* The BPT from this pool has the potential to be included in the Aave Safety Module which will provide a source of rewards encouraging users to deposit into the liquidity pool creating TVL and swap fee revenue for Balancer DAO.

# Summary

Currently, there are over 100 gauges active for voting. Many of them are currently not being utilized due to either not participating in the voting incentive market, or not generating enough fees although being potentially eligible for the core pool framework. These gauges have been active for weeks or months without any significant voting activity. Therefore, killing these gauges is important to keep our UI system clear and remove inactive veBAL participants.

# Motivation

Based on overall inactivity on the veBAL voting system, we identified 21 gauges to be killed. Removal of these gauges serves the purpose of cleaning up UX and removing stale entries from the voting list.

Following gauges are considered to be killed:

## Protocol Description
CoW Protocol lets people swap assets MEV protected at the best exchange rate by leveraging its batch settlement layer built on top of DeFi’s favorite AMMs and DEX Aggregators. Instead of directly executing trades on-chain, users only sign their swap intention and delegate the execution to so-called solvers (aka relayers in other protocols). Solvers bid on the best possible exchange rate in order to win the right to settle trades. By batching multiple trades together in order to create CoWs (Coincidence of Wants), solvers can save on gas costs, AMM fees and execution risk. Therefore CoWs lead to structurally better prices than on any existing DEX aggregator. In the absence of CoWs solvers fall back to using the best possible on-chain route, by comparing quotes from leading aggregators.

## Motivation
Strengthen the COW and BAL communities ties by giving a reward in COW tokens for veBAL voters, while increasing BAL rewards to COW liquidity providers. More in CowDAO proposal [here](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-using-cow-to-boost-bal-rewards-for-cow-lps/783)

## Specification

1.  **Governance**: CowDAO is governed by COW and vCOW token holders through snapshot votes and forum proposals. 

2.  **Oracles**: No use of oracles in CoW Protocol

3.  **Audits**: Settlement contract [audits](https://github.com/gnosis/gp-v2-contracts/tree/main/audits). COW token [audits](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-token/tree/main/audits).

4.  **Centralization vectors**: Orderbook and solver competition are still hosted on a server although decentralizing this part of the stack is on the roadmap. The potential risk is mainly censorship of orders. No user funds are at custody. Limit prices are enforced by an immutable smart contract. 

5.  **Market History**: COW was made transferable on March 28th and was launched with [incentives to provide liquidity on Balancer](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-4-cow-liquidity-incentive-program/295/20) pools. CowDAO is [considering](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-using-cow-to-boost-bal-rewards-for-cow-lps/783) using the veBAL voting system to boost BAL rewards for COW pools.",bearish
710,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes ApolloX (APX) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with ApolloX! ApolloX, a centralized and decentralized (CEX-DEX) hybrid derivatives exchange, was established by professionals from traditional financial institutions, tech companies and top crypto exchanges.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn APX tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 2,622,400 APX
 - **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on January 14th 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on February 13th 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 3.035 APX

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the APX Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide an APX-BUSD farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

#### What is APX?

From the team “ApolloX is a centralized and decentralized (CEX-DEX) hybrid derivatives exchange, and APX is ApolloX’s native token. APX is used to reward users and encourage them to stake and trade on the platform.

By participating in the Trading Rewards Program, users can obtain APX token rewards by trading any contract on its DEX and locking APX to get bonus rewards.APX tokens can also be used to offset trading fees.”

**Please note that as of the time of writing, there is a 1% transaction tax on all onchain APX transactions except for certain whitelisted target addresses. When trading the APX token, please ensure that you set your slippage tolerance to account for this. Please visit this link for more details:
https://docs.apollox.finance/apx-token/tax**

The official APX token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:

**https://bscscan.com/token/0x78f5d389f5cdccfc41594abab4b0ed02f31398b3**

Any other APX token will be a scam. Always verify the token address before buying tokens. If you receive an APX token airdrop from another address, it’s probably a scam, and we advise you to ignore it.",neutral
711,"# Summary
1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.

# Motivations
Launched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):

Total trading volume: $160B
Total swaps: 5.91M
Total users: 1.25M

1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.

The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.

In December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.

# Benefits to Aave Community

1INCH is highly liquid.
1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.
1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.
1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.

RoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3

3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.

1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.

1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.

On the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

The 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.

1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.

1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.

P2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.
1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.

Supported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.

# How is the asset currently used?

1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3

#Emission schedule

The 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.

Of the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).

Uncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).

# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability

The smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.

The 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.

## General

The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.

* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.
* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.
* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.
  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.
  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.
  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.

The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.

## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:

The 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M

The 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.

The 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.

On April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.

712,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

First, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to farms – the per block allocation to Farms and Lottery will remain at [**3.75 CAKE/block**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/Qme8aLLxh7UeAmiAxcUie7FWvSrBYdmNMFtHhGdMTFEFKX).

Importantly, the purpose of these proposals is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. In other words, redistributing farm rewards from the farms mentioned below will boost APRs for all other farms. 

By boosting APRs for higher-performing farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more capacity to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

713,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-deploy-balancer-to-optimism-managed-by-beethovenx/3072)

# Introduction

Most here likely recognize BeethovenX as the first approved friendly fork of Balancer which began back in October. Over the last six months they’ve proven themselves to be valuable contributors to the Balancer ecosystem - not only by contributing several pull requests to Balancer’s codebase but by exposing thousands of users to the power of Balancer’s technology. They have created and nurtured a vibrant community while building a world class team of operators behind it, from development to marketing to biz dev. 

With the prospect of Optimism launching a token and kicking off what could be an explosive summer of growth the timing is right to establish Balancer as the leading DEX before the gold rush begins. While Balancer Labs could take this on themselves this would mean putting key projects on hold, not to mention that it is far from guaranteed voters would choose to direct BAL emissions to Optimism pools without a financial incentive to do so. 

# Motivation

I propose that BeethovenX takes charge of an official Balancer deployment to Optimism including contract deployment, front end, infrastructure, and ongoing maintenance as required.  This removes any burden on Balancer’s human resources while also creating a strong financial incentive for BeethovenX to attract BAL emissions to Optimism pools. This is accomplished through the 50% protocol fee being split 50/50 between Balancer and BeethovenX. In order to bootstrap adoption and secure Balancer’s position as the leading Optimism DEX, **BeethovenX is allocating up to 3M BEETS for bribing veBAL voters in the first six months.** 

*Any farming by either protocol’s treasury on Optimism is acceptable with the condition that earned BAL rewards are either locked in veBAL or held on the balance sheet. No farming and dumping.* 

This presents a unique opportunity to deepen Balancer’s relationship with BeethovenX, a team which has proven strongly capable of leveraging Balancer technology successfully. As this would be “Balancer on Optimism, by BeethovenX” **veBAL would hold governance power** because we’re plugging into the gauge system. **The governance multisig would have five members, myself plus two Balancer community members and two from BeethovenX**. It’s worth pointing out that BeethovenX has no intention of leaving Fantom - this deal is specifically structured to keep all of their usual emissions on Fantom. They do however recognize the opportunity that exists on Optimism and by acting early we can secure a large share, hopefully the majority share, of the DEX market there. This would be a huge win for both protocols and I would point out that while Balancer has a large treasury to throw at opportunities like this you cannot buy the kind of quality team that BeethovenX brings to the table. 

# Specification

If this vote successfully passes, BeethovenX will begin work on Optimism as soon as possible. They will coordinate with Balancer Labs as required to plug in to the veBAL system. **To be clear, this vote passing would enable veBAL voters to direct BAL emissions to Optimism.** Individual pools would still need to go through the usual gauge approval process. Transaction specifications will be shared with the DAO Multisig as they become available with confirmation of authenticity from at least two independent sources.",bearish
714,"## ***Summary***

The London Business School (LBS) Blockchain Society, in alliance with Flipside Governance (@fig), FranklinDAO (@PennBlockchain), the University of Michigan (@Michigan_Blockchain), and Columbia University (@BlockchainAtColumbia), proposes to institute a gas fee rebate mechanism for recognised delegates voting on-chain on Aave.

## ***Motivation***

Gas fees on Ethereum have been increasing recently. As shown by data from Dune Analytics, median gas prices sit at around 30 gwei, with intradaily spikes often far exceeding that level. The amount of gas fees required for voting on-chain has therefore risen proportionally, increasing the cost of on-chain governance for delegates (particularly in light of the heavier recent proposal load at Aave).

**![|537x363](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oDESh98-zthvbro3LnZuiQcCRWRRqMXRcC_HzQNnbdKmKLZ40BN5_Zes9fmVp2kg7tMLV7uAmJKMqHvl-IAH45Ycf17xD-XRzrphEo_oUpREx-AtZYZ6cg0IRjiRB7AjKMPVI9bfyfHxjtr2ybCclrE)**

To find out more about gas costs on Aave, refer to the following dashboards created by Flipside here:

* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/janan/aave-delegates-rayk2E
* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/alitaslimi/aave-delegates-gas-usage-9LderL
* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Ali3N/aave-delegates-gas-usage-136ks0
* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/panda-gXSkiX/aave-gas-usage-on-votes-_zF8ba

LBS Blockchain Society, like other peer universities, is a not-for-profit, student-run organisation that depends on sponsorships and stipends to finance its operations. We currently receive monthly compensation for participating in MakerDAO governance, but otherwise receive no other form or income. Other schools like FranklinDAO (Penn Blockchain) are in very similar states. So far, we have been using this to cover gas costs at Aave, but the cost of on-chain governance remains a growing concern for us.

In light of this, we see rebating delegates for their participation as having the following benefits:

* Incentivise more active engagement of the delegate community by removing the disincentive to vote. Broader participation leads to better decision-making for Aave.
* Create a more diverse voter base that includes student organisations such as ours. Reducing the barrier to entry for voting creates a more open, collaborative delegate ecosystem. This in turn drives participation.
* Retain the best delegates to drive growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being a great Aave delegate should not be at a net cost to the delegate with regards to spending ever-increasing gas costs.
* Achievable at relatively low cost. We also outline measures to reduce the administrative burden for Aave below.

## ***Specification***

*Participation Criteria*

To incentivise maximal voter participation, we propose a participation-based rebate system. Participation is defined by the proportion of proposals, being the sum total of Snapshot polls and AIPs, voted on by a Recognized Delegate over the lesser of: 1) the previous 90 days, or 2) since becoming a Recognized Delegate. A Participation score of 100% would mean that a Delegate has voted on all polls and AIPs over this period. Moreover, only delegate platforms with 10k+ AAVE in voting power will be eligible for gas fee rebates, in order to avoid spam - the 10k is a small enough number to allow for enough delegate participation but filters out any spam.

*Note*: A Recognized Delegate is one with an Aave Delegate Platform, such as the LBS Blockchain Society, University of Michigan, FranklinDAO, Flipside, Llama, Aave Chan Initiative, Stablelabs, etc. The list of Recognized Delegates is open to change over time. A list of Aave Delegate Platforms can be found here, but note that there are a few new platforms and all of them may not have the required 10k AAVE voting power.

|Participation Rate over Previous 90 days|Gas Rebate|
| --- | --- |
|>80%|100%|
|50% to 80%|50%|
|<50%|0%|

*Claiming Process*

To reduce the administrative burden for Aave, we propose the claiming process should be initiated by Recognized Delegates themselves. Every month, Recognized Delegates have the option to submit a Gas Rebate Application to Aave, which shall include:

1. The list of transactions associated with voting on Aave proposals over that month
2. The corresponding gas fees spent on each transaction
3. Etherscan links detailing the above

Delegates can also choose to batch their Gas Rebate Applications (i.e. submit a single application for multiple months). However, any gas fees not claimed over a 12 month period will be automatically forfeited.

Once an application has been submitted to Aave, an appointed Governance Facilitator will review the applications and submit an AIP to pay out the gas fees. To that end, we have created a Dune dashboard that the Governance Facilitator can use to calculate the gas costs paid by a specific address, i.e., the address used by delegates to vote. The dashboard can be found [here](https://dune.com/parkyeung/aave-governance-voting-gas-costs). Initially, we propose that the Aave Chan Initiative plays the role of Governance Facilitator.

To calculate the participation rate for delegates, we recommend using the following formula:

*Number of Proposals Voted on Since First Vote / Total Number of Proposals Since First Vote*

For example, assume a Delegate Platform’s first vote was on Jan 1 2023. If they apply for a gas rebate on Feb 1 2023, and there have been 20 proposals between Jan 1 and Feb 1, out of which the Delegate has voted for 17 proposals, their participation rate is 85%.

We are working to publish a tool to easily calculate participation rate for the Governance Facilitator and will update this post once it is ready.

We propose the funds to be paid from the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract, but defer to the community for guidance on the most appropriate source of funds.

*Gas Rebate Token*

We consider two options for the Gas Rebate Token: 1) ETH, the native asset in which gas fees are paid, and 2) stablecoins (e.g. USDC, DAI).

The list of holdings in the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c#assets-wallet).

Each option above has associated trade-offs (for example certain assets may be deemed more strategic than others, or represent larger existing holdings). We would welcome community feedback on the most appropriate asset in advance of voting.

#### Tl;dr

Taking into account the current market environment, and to better serve the smaller projects that join us for farm auctions, we are proposing the following changes for the upcoming #31 farm auctions, on **September 29 2022:**

* Frequency of farm auctions: 2 weeks > **3 weeks** 
* Minimum bidding of CAKE: 5,000 CAKE > **7,000 CAKE**
* Winning farms: 1x multiplier from 7 days > **10 days**
* Number of winners: **3** (No change)
* Bidding time: **1 hour** (No change)


#### Proposal for longer community Farm Rewards

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce some changes to the farm auctions’ parameters, and would like to seek your support. Read on to find out more!

#### What are Farm Auctions?

Farm Auctions are a **cost-efficient** way of boosting projects’ volume and attracting organic traffic/users. Not only will this bootstrap and bring **immediate liquidity** for project tokens, it also means that liquidity providers can farm CAKE at a **high APY**!

#### What are the key parameters changes?

* Frequency of farm auctions: 2 weeks > **3 weeks** 
* Minimum bidding of CAKE: 5,000 CAKE > **7,000 CAKE**
* Winning farms: 1x multiplier from 7 days > **10 days**
* Number of winner: **3** (No change)
* Bidding time: **1 hour** (No change)

#### Why change?

Firstly, a longer farm benefits everyone. A **10 days 1x farm** would be more attractive to projects as well as you. On one hand, winning projects will have a 10 days farm, 3 days longer than the usual 7 days farm, this will allow them to have **greater exposure** and “air time” to our **huge community**. You will also be able to stake LP in the winners’ farms for 3 days longer, and take the extra time to learn about the projects while earning yummy CAKE tokens.

Secondly, more time between farm auctions enables projects to fully utilize the Farms won through farm auctions, such as planning **more detailed marketing** and/or **product roadmaps**. The change in farm auction frequency is in line with the longer farm duration, and setting farm auctions to happen once every 3 weeks means projects have more time to come up with a **bidding strategy** and maximize their benefit from the farm auctions

Thirdly, the extra time between farm auctions will allow PancakeSwap to consider a **wider group of projects**. This would make each farm auctions more exciting to participate in for projects, and more exciting for you to witness, and give up-and-coming projects a chance to win a farm to boost their liquidity and volume- this will in turn benefit the entire BNB ecosystem.


#### What is the process of farm auctions?
![](https://i.imgur.com/pjUwxz1.png)
 
#### How do project teams win the auctions?

Farm auctions will be held once every 3 weeks, we will provide **THREE** 1x CAKE multiplier farms, lasting for a longer period of 10 days** for projects to bid on. Project teams simply bid enough CAKE to be in the top three projects by the end of the auctions to win a 1x CAKE multiplier farm for their token! The CAKE tokens contributed by the three winning projects will be taken as payment and burned in the next CAKE burn.

If project teams do not end up contributing enough CAKE to be in the top three projects, they will be able to claim their CAKE back and try again in the next farm auctions.

We will try and get back to projects on their application as soon as possible. If projects have any queries, they can reach out to @PancakeSwapBD on Telegram.",neutral

717,"This vote is being submitted by the Venus Community on behalf of Polygon Labs in response to their proposal submitted to the Venus Community Forum on August 1st 2023. 

Introduction

The community of Venus Protocol has made significant strides since their inception in 2020, successfully lowering the entry barrier for millions of users worldwide and positioning themselves as one of the most widely utilized decentralized applications in web3.

To continue pushing the envelope of DeFi’s potential, we propose that the Venus Money Mark Protocol be deployed on Polygon zkEVM. This deployment will provide a synergy between Venus Protocol and Polygon zkEVM, a scalable Layer 2 protocol, potentially enhancing the user experience and risk management features for Venus’ growing community.

Additionally, given the close relationship between PancakeSwap and Venus, we’re excited to continue supporting one of the largest pairs of partners in DeFi.

Rationale

We believe this is the right moment for Venus to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons:

Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility.
Polygon zkEVM is an Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.

The Polygon ecosystem is aligned with Ethereum and its values.
LayerZero has deployed their endpoint on Polygon zkEVM, in line with the Omnichain Money Market 5 post for cross-chain expansion on Venus.
The migration to Polygon zkEVM would not only capitalize on the compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts but also benefit from the scalability features offered by Polygon’s zkEVM.

Polygon zkEVM, an open-source ZK-Rollup, delivers a hassle-free user experience withEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It flawlessly integrates with pre-existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets. Leveraging the strength of ZK proofs, Polygon zkEVM significantly reduces transaction expenses and substantially boosts transaction speed, while also adopting Ethereum’s robust security. The Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta was successfully launched on March 27, 2023.

Benefits

*Listing assets on Polygon zkEVM within Venus isolated pools to further enhance protocol and asset use-cases.

*Multi-chain expansion into the Polygon ecosystem introduces the successful Venus protocol to a completely new set of Ethereum-adjacent builders.

*Enhanced User Experience: Leveraging the Polygon zkEVM can minimize user and developer friction and provide a smoother, more seamless experience.

*Risk Management: Venus’s isolated pools feature and Polygon zkEVM’s verifiable zero-knowledge proofs can further bolster the protocol’s security and risk management capabilities.

Incentives

To help bootstrap Venus’ growth on Polygon zkEVM, we will provide a $100,000 MATIC grant, with the aim of user acquisition.

Additionally, we will provide additional incentives for Venus’ continued growth on Polygon zkEVM:

$50k at $10m TVL
$50k at $25m TVL

Finally, the core DeFi BD team at Polygon Labs will work closely with the Venus team to:

*Co-Market Venus’ launch on Polygon zkEVM

*Connect Venus to the large ecosystem of Polygon-based builders who are eager to work with the money market

*Work closely with Venus on any questions around launch across developer, business development, and project support.

Proposal:
Deploy Venus Protocol on Polygon zkEVM:
Deployment on Polygon zkEVM, Venus will also get the opportunity to get the added advantages of the Polygon Ecosystem, ranging from not only business development support of Polygon Labs, but also community expansion, marketing support, chance to participate in an ecosystem with more than 50000 dAPPs, and support from the best product and solutions engineering team in crypto industry.

Legal

The legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as “Polygon Labs”.

Conflict of Interest Declaration

There are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Venus's legal entities, including Venus, Venus tokens, nor investments of Venus.

Risk Profile

Deploying on Polygon zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer 2 protocol, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereum’s core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens. More information outlined in detail in our first party docs here: https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/ 5",neutral
718,"The primary goal of this Snapshot Vote is to perform a temperature check for the proposal to work with Native.org to integrate a fully DAO owned swap on Venus.

Native.org is modular DEX infrastructure that makes it easy for projects and DAOs to deploy their own custom exchanges. Using Native, a project can add swap as a feature on their website within minutes, and truly own it. 

Funding Milestones and Payments: No funding is required.

What is Native asking for:

1 day engineering time to integrate Native with Venus’ existing router.

What's expected to be delivered by Native:

*Tech infrastructure for Venus to create and deploy its own swap
*Equal liquidity and variety compared to PancakeSwap
*Equal or better pricing for users compared to PancakeSwap
*All fee revenue go to Venus DAO

Why should Venus DAO vote yes to this? 

This integration would create a new revenue stream for Venus and lowers fees for users to Swap tokens and the best of all,  at no cost to the project.

## Protocol Description

Luchadores is an NFT collection and associated auto battler game, started originally on Ethereum. It features 10 000 Luchadores NFT, each of which can be played in the game. 

![lucha-banner|690x172](upload://gBTnsaVMCjYdnKyn997VGgzRBtn.jpeg)


Since the start, the Luchadores team has adhered to a “purist” ideal: the NFTs are fully onchain (svg art), attributes were allocated with provable randomness thanks to ChainLink VRF, and the game itself will live onchain too.

#### A flash of Luchadores history

Luchadores NFT - _mint_init 17/05/2021; mint_end 18/08/2021_

The Luchadores NFT were launched on 17 May 2021, with 10 000 Luchadores mintable for 2 LINK (VRF price) + gas costs in ETH. It took about three months for the full collection to be minted, with a sizable interest spike as the end of the mint was approaching.

##### **LUCHA token launch** _23/12/2021_

In December 2021, the LUCHA token was released on the Polygon network. 6,18% of the total supply was allocated to Luchadores NFT holders over 1 year. The amount of LUCHA tokens earned daily per Luchadores NFT owned depends on their rarity. Other incentives were distributed for tournament winners (prizes), and soon to be earned in the game. 

![lucha-yield|690x388](upload://keUUpIeMxovR428pAUHKVIBM48u.png)

##### **Piñatas _pinata_1_init: 31/01/2022; pinata_1_end: 01/02/2022_**

Piñatas are ERC-1155 NFTs on Polygon containing random accessories for Luchadores. The first round of piñatas sold out in less than two days, as fellow Luchadores were hungry for gear.

##### **LUCHA_yield_extension** ([LIP-2](https://snapshot.org/#/luchadores.eth/proposal/0xd775ac6b9872533485de12e0b937909e8b9dc913cda77a8ff0addf65c543d4e4)) 15/12/2022

The daily yield allocated to Luchadores holders was extended for a one-year period with the LIP-2 vote

##### **LUCHA_yield_clawback** ([LIP-3](https://snapshot.org/#/luchadores.eth/proposal/0x117c3ba2abc60b9e52c26eaf00e8861c71aa42511999153789da3fb679461299)) _21/02/2023_ & **POL_strategy** _24/03/2023_ ([LIP-4](https://snapshot.org/#/luchadores.eth/proposal/0xef78874686c2cab4a16b72c0f95536d0be5fc755d8254e9bac1b0e21da2131d0)) 

14 months after the token release, and because of the LIP-2 results, the DAO decided to redeem the unclaimed $LUCHA of the first year and use it to fund the POL strategy. 

2,25% of the total supply was retrieved (over the 6,18% for the first year rewards) and allocated to liquidity and vote incentives. 

##### Tournaments

To date, 3 tournaments have been organized, offering a unique opportunity for Luchadores to prove their skills in the arena. Interested players can register their Luchadores, select their desired statistics and skills, and that's it! 

The grids are generated randomly; the matches are played automatically, and the player can check the results of his Luchadores the next day. Luchadores who perform well in tournaments can earn piñatas, LUCHA, accessories, and even Luchadores NFT.

**_VRF full on-chain game, Independent team, no pre-mint, no team allocation._**


### Motivation

After more than one year of existence, the LUCHA token is now widely distributed; with the Fight-to-Earn component launch approaching, the team is also looking to improve the liquidity situation beforehand.

Thanks to LIP-3 and LIP-4 votes, the total liquidity available on the pool increased massively, with the vast majority of it being protocol-owned. The **LUCHA/wMATIC Balancer pool is already the main pool to exchange the token**, and its importance will accrue.

![image|669x500](upload://pZk11UT3F1RX8ZZmHlwdXqJdpeR.png)

Side/Arbitrage pools are also available: ComethSwap LUCHA/wMATIC, LUCHA/MUST; [UNIV3 LUCHA/MATIC](https://dexscreener.com/polygon/0x821f6db4e34d2b4c822bd374c499cd62f57e17cf)

Additionally, the Luchadores DAO will create vote incentives on Warden Quest to attract more veBAL & other wrappers voting power while building its own strategic assets holdings. Independent vlAURA holders have also expressed their intent to support the voting on the gauge if obtained in its early days.

The governance is also considering switching the LUCHA staking model to a veLUCHA one, where holders can stake (and, if they want, lock) LUCHA/wMATIC BPT tokens to earn MASK, the non-transferable in-game currency, BAL rewards, and other benefits.

### Specifications

1. **Governance**: There is no on-chain governance as the game and the token are still at an early stage. Voting via Snapshot covers treasury and token-related decisions, executed through a 2/4 multi-sig. As development progresses, the game and its related infrastructure will be increasingly on-chain (Polygon).
2. **Oracles**: The Luchadores do not rely on external oracles.
3. **Audits**: The LUCHA token is a standard ERC-20 token
4. **Centralization vectors**: The multisig mentioned above is the main centralization vector in the current stage. While the Luchadores NFT is built for resilience, the LUCHA token requires more guardrails until the game is finetuned and fight to earn is launched.
5. **Market history**: After significant volatility at first, the LUCHA price stabilized while the initial supply was being distributed.
6. **Value**: This pool is already the primary source of liquidity for the LUCHA token and is expected to scale up significantly as veLUCHA staking and locking are introduced.

3- Reducing the rewards of syrup pools to cake, and stopping the rewards of farms with cake, and using cakes for syrup pools and farms with high rewards for best token in market (BTC, ETH, BNB, MATIC, ALGO, ADA, SOL, LUNA and etc) so that the community is encouraged to buy cakes to get useful market tokens through shares.

723,"Make the APY for AutoCake pool proportional to the ammount of CAKE staked.
The more you stake the higher the APY.",bullish
724,"This is a bit complex so think it through:

In a nutshell;
Binance allows shorting CAKE. So CAKE can become like a stable coin by purchasing 50%
CAKE and Shorting 50% CAKE - and then auto rebalancing with an algorithm as required depending on if
CAKE price goes up or down. Use this to pay high APR for staking stable coins.

In more detail:

1 Allow users to stake stable coins - USDT, USDC, BUSD, etc.. on PCS.

2 Write code to automatically market buy CAKE with staked stable coins.

3 Write code to automatically stake half of the CAKE in the CAKE syrup pool.

4 With the other half of the purchased CAKE write code to automatically short CAKE (work with Binance
to set this up).

5 Write code to keep the proper ratio of CAKE in the syrup pool vs. CAKE being shorted so that there is
minimal gain or loss with the fluctuations of CAKE price. (Think this through, it is possible excluding the
transaction fees and short interest charged). Chefs are smart they can figure this out and write an
algorithim that works.

6 You are going to have to pay fees and shorting interest - this will be paid from the CAKE profits from
the 50% CAKE staked.

Presently CAKE pays 67% APR. Let's pretned 7% of that goes to transaction fees and shorting fees (it is
likely much less than that). So we are down to 60% APR.
But only half of the CAKE is being staked. So we cut the APR in half to 30%.

When someone withdrawls their stable coin, the CAKE is removed from the Short postion and Syrup
pool in proper porportions and converted back to the stable coin and they get their stable coin with the
staking profits.

Staking stables for 30% profit ? Fantastic, but let's not be that nice.
Take half of the CAKE profits and burn them!!

So you get 15% APR profits for staking a stable coin. Still pretty awesome!

How beneficial is this really ?

1) Hundreds of millions of dollars will be staked. How do I know ? Check the stable farms usdc-busd,
usdc-usdt, etc.. They have hundreds of millions and the APR is around 8 to 10%. Therefore hundreds of
millions of dollars of CAKE will be market purchased and locked up and out of circulation. Supply and
Demand!

2) 50% of the CAKE purchased will never earn rewards and won't dilute the CAKE syrup pool. It will be
on Binance shorting CAKE.

3) The other 50% will earn CAKE but half of it gets burned, helping turn CAKE deflationary.

4) Many in crypto keep a portion of their crypto in stables, if they can earn 15% APR in stables on a
reliable and trustworhty platform they will do it.

This is a game changer if it can be implemented, I hope you vote yes. As the person coming up with this idea, if it is accepted AND implemented by the Chefs I would ask the first 3000 CAKE burned by this mechanism be sent to the address of this proposal as a reward.",bullish

727,"This temperature check will gauge delegates' interest/support for deploying the onboarding package to BSC.

I've attached the forum thread for the full context.

**TLDR**: The Uniswap Onboarding Package is for new deployments of Uniswap v3 to get set up with three-month liquidity incentives, a frontend (Oku), and incentives distribution tooling (Angle Merkl). These resources will help position Uniswap to have a formidable presence on new EVM chains.

**How the vote works**:
The temperature check will be considered met as long as the total number of votes cast for the funding options is over >10M. If there isn't a clear winner for which level of incentives the chain should receive, a discussion can be had before the onchain proposal.

**Notes**:
* Applies to recent deployments of Uniswap v3 where delegates vote for them
* Pools will be primarily blue chips (ETH-USDC, ETH/WBTC, USDC-USDT) and a local pool if applicable. The onchain vote will include the final details for pool info.
* The Accountability Committee will escrow the inflight incentives.
* Oku will only be paid for new deployments, not existing ones or ones already contracted. Oku prices all standard deployments at $45k for the initial integration and $5k/month for 12 months.
* Angle Merkl will only be paid their integration fee for new deployments. For new deployments and new chains, Merkl is €20k. For existing chains, new Uni v3 deployments are €10k.
* Angle Merkl charges 3% on incentives distributed with their system. They have offered a 25% discount on their base 3% fee for incentives distributed between $2.5m-$5m, a 50% discount on incentives distributed between $5m-$10m, and a 75% discount on all incentives above $10m in a 365-day period.",neutral
728,"Deploy Aave on Cronos chain

The following proposal follows the ARC draft proposal posted for comments [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deploy-aave-v3-on-cronos-chain/7287), more than 5 days ago, that follows the standard governance process framework.

**Proposal**

Launched in 2021 after years of open-source R&D, Cronos is #9 public blockchain by DeFi value locked according to  [Defillama](https://defillama.com/chains)  (around 2.5 B$ TVL to date). Cronos proposes to deploy Aave V3 to the Cronos chain and to incentivize liquidity in order to help fulfill the promise of a multi-chain future.

Cronos is the first Ethereum-compatible blockchain network built on Cosmos SDK technology. An open-source Layer 1 chain launched under the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  umbrella, Cronos aims to massively scale the DeFi and dApp (Web3) user community by providing builders with the ability to instantly port apps and crypto assets from other chains while benefiting from low transaction fees, high throughput, and fast finality.

In 2020 and 2021, hundreds of millions of consumers have purchased their first cryptos, the majority via a centralized exchange. Tens of millions of them already have a connection with the strategic partners of the Cronos project: as [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  customers, as holders of CRO or other tokens of the Cosmos ecosystem, and/or as [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  project supporters. These crypto users are now eager to take the next step in Web3. For them, Cronos is a natural gateway into the broader world of self-custody, Ethereum and DeFi.

The cross-chain future that is such an integral part of Aave V3, resonates well with the motivations of Cronos users. Therefore, Cronos represents an ideal ground to demonstrate the promise of Aave V3.

**Technical specifications of the network**

*Network specifications*

[Cronos](https://cronos.crypto.org/)  is an open-source project launched by  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  that brings together many  [open-source initiatives](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/blob/main/go.mod#L22)  of the Ethereum, Cosmos and IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) ecosystems. At its core, it is a fully EVM-compatible alternative Layer 1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK (Ethermint implementation).

Cronos mainnet has been live since November 2021 and is already home to more than 120 partners and more than 340,000 DeFi and NFT users. Cronos is powered by the CRO cryptocurrency, which counts tens of millions of holders and users worldwide thanks to its support by  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) . All key network statistics can be viewed on the Etherscan deployment, called  [Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/charts)  , as well as on  [Defillama for TVL data](https://defillama.com/chain/Cronos)  .

At the protocol level, Cronos relies on a Proof of Authority consensus where each validator’s voting power is proportional to their stake in the protocol’s staking token. There are currently 26 live validators, with room for more. The consensus delivers fast finality with block times between 5 and 6 seconds, low transaction fees (usually below 1 USD) paid in CRO token, and small environmental footprint.

Users and Dapp developers interact with Cronos primarily through the usual EVM Web3 JSON-RPC  [endpoints](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  . They can deploy any EVM-compatible smart contract written in Solidity, and can use all the usual end-user and developer tooling: MetaMask, Etherscan block explorer ([Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/) ), Gnosis Safe, Truffle, Hardhat, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Web3.py, etc.

The Cronos team is actively in contact with the relevant teams to implement all the components needed for robust Aave V3 deployment and operations, specifically the Chainlink oracle, The Graph indexer, and commercial and JSON-RPC endpoints for Dapps (in addition to the existing  [free ones](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  ). These teams are in process of assigning engineering resources to work on these project. A likely target launch date for these additional components is early Q2 2022. Cronos protocol engineering resources stand ready to support these projects.

There are several bridges between Cronos and other networks :

* [Live] Fast withdrawals from and to the  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  app and exchange.
* [Upcoming] Native bridge from and to the Ethereum mainnet via Gravity Bridge technology, currently in testing and planned for imminent launch.
* [Live] IBC transfers from and to the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  chain, Cosmos Hub, and Terra, with more IBC-compatible chains on the roadmap.
* [Live] EVM smart contract-based transfers from and to BSC, Polygon, and other EVM chains via 3 independent bridges, with more to come.
* Security review of additional bridges is under way.

Cronos is an open ecosystem supported by a wide range of more than 120  [contributors](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  ,  [validators](https://cronos.crypto.org/partners)  , and  [Dapp developers](https://cronos.crypto.org/ecosystem)  . This includes 2 large AMM/DEXes, VVS Finance (1.4 B$ TVL) and MM Finance (320 M$ TVL).

The  [roadmap](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-chain-journey-so-far-and-2022-roadmap-3475abbe6254)  is ambitious and includes protocol and database optimizations, further connectivity and interoperability, best-in-class tooling and infrastructure, further protocol governance decentralization, dozens of DeFi and GameFi Dapps, and longer term plans to increase scalability.

*Aave V3 implementation*

As part of this proposal, Aave V3 will be deployed to Cronos like any Web3 protocol, given that Cronos is fully EVM-compatible. Aave operations will rely on the Chainlink oracle and The Graph indexer (implementation under way).

The Aave V3 Portal will be able to leverage robust EVM-based cross-chain bridges (such as Connext and others, subject to further testing and security review) for the transfer of underlying assets backing aTokens.

*Metrics and references*

Chain data as of Feb 15, 2022:
* 26 live validators.
* 15+ M transactions to date (no transaction pumping!)
* 150,000 to 200,000 transactions per day, with potential to increase by 5x to 20x in the short term.
* 350,000 unique wallets.
* More than 120 Dapps deployed in the last 3 months, including VVS (DEX, 1.4 B$ TVL), MM Finance (DEX, 320 M$ TVL), Tectonic (decentralized lending, 275 M$ TVL), and others.

**Proposed list of initial collaterals**

The proposed list of initial collaterals is: CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, ATOM, LUNA, DOT.

As indicated above, Chainlink price feeds are being scheduled for deployment.

Cronos already supports the  [following cross-chain assets](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#integration-guide-for-cronos-mainnet-beta)  : CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, SHIB, DOGE, ATOM, LINK, ENJ, ELON, TUSD, LUNA, DOT, BIFI, with more to come. Additional native tokens include VVS, TONIC. These tokens have between 10 M$ and 700 M$ of liquidity on Cronos. Daily volume for the corresponding pairs is between 20 and 30 M$.

The proposed tokens have more than, or close to, 2 M$ daily volume each. With respect to DEX statistics, see  [VVS analytics](https://vvs.finance/info)  for history and liquidity per token.

**Incentives**

Particle B, the Web3 accelerator of the Cronos chain, has an initial allocation of USD 100 million in CRO tokens for ecosystem development. A portion of these funds will be allocated to end-user incentives, commensurate with the large user and TVL growth potential of Aave V3 on Cronos.

In our experience, the effectiveness of liquidity mining incentives varies depending on market conditions, hence the exact programs and amounts (expected to be worth several M$) will need to be refined over time.

**Audits and security**

Cronos mainnet was launched in November 2021 and has not experienced outages so far.

An audit of relevant components of the underlying Ethermint codebase (  [crypto](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/crypto)  ,  [JSON RPC](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/ethereum/rpc)  ,  [Ante handler](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/app)  ,  [EVM state transition](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/blob/main/x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go)  ) was commissioned by Foris Ltd and completed by Kudelski Security. It is published in the Cronos Github repository ([link](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/tree/main/docs/audit)).

# How do you stake CAKE to earn HERO rewards?
If you own CAKE tokens, congratulations! You’re the master of your … pancakes.
Time to step up your taste buds by learning how to stake CAKE with Syrup Pool.
- Visit this webpage: [**https://pancakeswap.finance/syrup** ](https://pancakeswap.finance/syrup )
- Click “Approve CAKE” on the HERO Syrup Pool 
- Click on the stake button.
- Confirm the transaction.

BEP20 HERO will also be circulating and transferable on BSC when we start the Syrup pool, so you will be able to harvest your HERO tokens and trade on PancakeSwap at any time!



# BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING! ⚠️⚠️⚠️💀

The official HERO token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:
[**https://bscscan.com/token/0xE8176d414560cFE1Bf82Fd73B986823B89E4F545**](https://bscscan.com/token/0xE8176d414560cFE1Bf82Fd73B986823B89E4F545)

Any other HERO token will be a scam and will result in a financial loss for users. Do not buy tokens from any other token address. Always verify the token address before purchasing tokens. If you receive airdrops from another address for HERO tokens, they will be rotten tokens (but not the cool kind!), and we advise you to ignore them.",bearish

731,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Back Highstreet ($HIGH) to Syrup Pool!

CAKE holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from **Highstreet**. Highstreet is an open-world metaverse that incorporates shopping, gaming, NFTs, traditional and crypto brands in a massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).

#### What is Boost?

Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, the HIGH-BUSD farm will go to a 1x multiple for 48 hours, then 0.5x thereafter. Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the boosted period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BSC, fundamental token issues, etc.
 
At the same time, there will be a delicious, new HIGH Syrup Pool with 168,600 HIGH tokens to be earned by staking CAKE. Get your CAKE ready!


#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn HIGH tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 168,600 HIGH
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on February 25th 2022
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on April 26th 2022
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.09756 HIGH

#### Max Stake per wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### What is $HIGH?

From the team: “Highstreet is a decentralized metaverse where brands - both traditional and crypto, can use their Merchant Portal to seamlessly integrate and build their presence in Highstreet World.

HIGH is Highstreet's native token which provides holders with in-game access for game progression and access to special events, serves as an in-game currency, and can be used for on-chain governance.”

#### To learn more about Highstreet, the chefs advise you to visit their official communication channels:

732,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-polygon-authorize-batch-relayer-v2-for-usd-boosted-pool/2655).

This proposal aims to authorize an updated version of the Batch Relayer which adds (un)wrapping capabilities for [ERC-4626 tokens](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) and [UnbuttonTokens](https://github.com/buttonwood-protocol/button-wrappers/blob/main/contracts/UnbuttonToken.sol#L18). For reference, the [original Batch Relayer](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0xedff802a4ffb1ba0e131c7d4126fa669648a9333860a74de57c9e5971b9ec541) enabled atomic sequences of `swaps`, `joins`, and `exits`, as well as (un)wrapping of stETH and Aave aTokens. Batch Relayer V2 retains all of those features from V1.

This proposal seeks authorization for Batch Relayer V2 **only on Polygon**, as it is anticipated that a Batch Relayer V3 will soon be available on all networks. This intermediate release is targeted specifically at a new USD+ Boosted Pool on Polygon.

The relayer would be granted authority to perform the following tasks on behalf of users **who have opted into using it**:

* Leverage the user’s existing Vault allowances and internal balances to avoid duplicate approvals.
* Swap on the user’s behalf.
* Add and remove liquidity on the user’s behalf.

## Motivation

The team at [Overnight](https://overnight.fi/), who created the USD+ yield-bearing stable coin, played a significant role in the development of the new [`ERC4626LinearPool`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/pool-linear/contracts/erc4626/ERC4626LinearPool.sol). This pool supports tokens implementing the recently finalized [EIP-4626 Tokenized Vault Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626), and the Balancer Integrations Team believes it has the potential to open up Boosted Pools to a plethora of yield-bearing tokens. We thank Overnight for their patience throughout the integrations process and would like to add relayer support for their new pool as soon as possible.

The relayer will enable trades involving the rebasing USD+ which is incompatible with the Balancer Vault. It does this by (un)wrapping from/to the StaticUsdPlus token, which is an ERC-4626 token wrapper that removes the rebasing component. This will effectively create direct markets for USD+ on Balancer, not only via DAI, USDC, and USDT, but also via multihop to any other connected token within the Vault. For example, the relayer would enable the following atomic DAI->USD+ trade:

1. perform a multihop batch swap from DAI to StaticUsdPlus through the USD+ Boosted Pool;
2. unwrap the StaticUsdPlus tokens from step 1, receiving plain USD+ tokens;

## Risks

This proposal would only grant the required roles to the `BalancerRelayer` contract. Each user would still be required to opt into the relayer by submitting an approval transaction or signing a message.

The code is a simple wrapper over existing Balancer pool interactions, and it has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the Balancer Labs team.

The addresses of the `BalancerRelayer` and `BatchRelayerLibrary` mentioned in this proposal can be found in the [official repo](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/pull/1182/commits/cc113a4aaa9f3869a5accfdf236eafd6528a74d2).

## Specification

The Balancer governance multisig **on Polygon** would submit a transaction to the `Authorizer` in order to grant the following roles to the `BalancerRelayer`:

1. `manageUserBalance` : Utilize existing Vault allowances and internal balances so that a user does not have to re-approve the new relayer for each token.
2. `joinPool` : Add liquidity to a pool on the user’s behalf.
3. `exitPool` : Remove liquidity from a pool on the user’s behalf.
4. `swap` : Trade within a single pool on the user’s behalf.
5. `batchSwap` : Make a multihop trade or source liquidity from multiple pools.
6. `setRelayerApproval` : Approve the relayer on the user’s behalf (user must still provide a signed message).

The Gnosis Safe at `0xd2bD536ADB0198f74D5f4f2Bd4Fe68Bae1e1Ba80` would send a transaction to the Vault Authorizer at `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` with the following data to authorize the BalancerRelayer at `0xF537dDd7f4cc72C6C08866b62EAe9378f1F62da8`:

734,"To increase Aave protocol V3 efficiency and allow faster updates to caps on V3 markets this snapshot vote intends to implement a fast track framework for these caps.

Suggested fast-track process :

Step 1 - Governance thread for 24h
Step 2 - Snapshot with immediate vote open for 48h
Step 3 - Community multisig enforcement

Suggested scope & limitations of the fast-track process :
- Fast-track can only act on Supply & Borrow caps within a 30% to 100% modification range
- Fast-track requires an 80k AAVE quorum
- This process can only be applied to assets listed for at least 2 weeks.
- The process should take maximum 4 days. Meaning that in networks currently with Guardian, the Guardian should prepare the signing in advance, to assure execution not more than 24h after Snapshot closes positively.

This current proposal also would also upgrade the USDC supply cap on Aave Avalanche V3 market of +100% to a new total of 4B$ meaning that both adoption and execution of this framework would be the outcome of this proposal if YAE is leading at the end of the vote.

735,"**Summary:**
FIAT DAO is seeking the preliminary approval of veBAL gauges for two yet-to-be-deployed stableswap pools.

- **FIAT-USDC-DAI**
- **FIAT-FEI-FRAX**

This comes after the successful migration of our governance token $FDT’s liquidity to the Balancer platform over the past month.

**References/Useful links:**

- **[App](https://app.fiatdao.com)**
- **[Docs](https://docs.fiatdao.com)**
- **[Dune](https://dune.com/1ab/FIAT)**
- **[Github](https://github.com/fiatdao)**
- **[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/fiatdao)**

**Protocol Description:**
The FIAT protocol is a DeFi-native repo market solution for providing liquidity to holders of fixed income assets. It allows users of apps like Element Finance, Notional Finance, and Yield Protocol to bring their proofs of liquidity to the protocol in order to collateralize a debt position in $FIAT, a stable value asset. Our v1 has just launched, and it’ll look and feel familiar for users who have previously minted DAI, RAI, or MIM. By utilizing proven stablecoin mechanisms, the protocol is able to offer competitive borrowing power to holders of such collateral assets, allowing them to releverage fixed yields or meet current liabilities as the locked assets mature. You can learn more about its primary use case via [this thread](https://twitter.com/wjvill/status/1527680960866705408) from Element founder Will Villanueva.

**The success of FIAT is predicated on its ability to attract secondary liquidity.** In its current iteration, it is pooling secondary liquidity around a singular asset, drawing forward demand for an otherwise fragmented universe of collateral backing. Unique to FIAT versus other CDP implementations is that fixed term collateral forces users to repay back their debt at a known point in time, lest they bear negative yields due to FIAT interest accrual on those positions thereafter - this allows for higher maximum LTVs and potentially more trading fees for LPs. Currently, only stablecoin-denominated collateral is supported by the protocol, so any risk premium is a function of smart contract concerns or changes in prevailing yields.

**Motivation:**
Over the course of its first month in existence, $FIAT has had its liquidity subsidized on Curve via a discretionary budget. Over the same time, liquidity for our governance token has been ported to Balancer. We’ve been very pleased with the migration and think it makes sense to follow suit with $FIAT here in its early days.

A number of items excite us about the opportunity:

- The presence of boosted staBAL and now FEI-FRAX-DAI pools will allow for user pathways that involve depositing into either, minting FIAT, and selling FIAT for more of the underlying in order to gain levered fixed exposure. **This results in locked TVL for Balancer and higher trading fees for Balancer LPs.**

- With Hidden Hand, it will become possible to have a larger consortium of projects actively subsidize FIAT LPs. We anticipate that all of our collateral partners with associated ERC-20 tokens will see the value in deeper FIAT liquidity for their protocols. And for other stableswap pools that exist on Balancer, deeper FIAT liquidity increases the odds of locked TVL in their pools.

- The user experience associated with veBAL and Hidden Hand is more clear than our current Curve → Rari Fuse flow.

**What we would like to discuss in this thread, however, is the deployment of the stableswap pools themselves.** Given the nature of FIAT (i.e. CDP architecture, stablecoin backing, audited collateral issuers), we would be interested to hear what members of the Balancer DAO have to say regarding their comfort with varying levels of potential [A coefficients](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/math/stable-math). If you have any specific thoughts regarding this topic, please share your opinion in the thread!

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** FIAT DAO is a completely on-chain organization, with no corresponding real world entity in place. The FDT token has been given away for free since November of 2021, and a DAO smart contract architecture has been live since December 2021.

2. **Oracles:** $FDT is a standard ERC-20 DeFi governance token that comes with the volatility inherent to the sector. $FIAT is a DAI-like asset that will come to be backed by less liquid derivatives, but at the moment only supports collateral types with existing secondary markets.

3. **Audits:** Audits of our protocol and our collateral oracle system can be found in the [Security](https://github.com/fiatdao/security) repo within our Github.

4. **Centralization Vectors:** $FDT holders determine which assets are supported as collateral and the parameters associated with each. A six of eleven guardian multisig currently holds certain emergency privileges.

5. **Market History:** $FIAT has been transferable since April 2022. It previously reached a high watermark of $1.3M deposited on Curve.

We would like to take this to a vote now that the FUD pool is live.

737,"In order to this to work we as a community we need to unite forces to this to work I am proposing a slight interest per transaction on the dex when we make a trade or buy tokens so you will need cake in order to use the dex (this value is not set can be 0.1%, 0.2% 0.5% to 1%  we need to agree on this it will be like eip 1559 o eth but only for the cake token) that will make more scares to the value of the token this will be a tuff measurement but it will benefit every one that is holding the cake toke and is part of the ecosystem an will make cake more deflationary over time….
This is only a proposal it can be change but just think this cake can become deflationary if this is implemented may be for a couple of blocks as a little experiment or use as a burning mechanism for short time periods… 
But this will be so bullish to the dex if is implemented",bullish
738,"### Motivation

Since the [approval of the CREAM/WETH gauge](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xa8ef52b06d2e5742e9068582276e878441c29a924e8bb2a9c26686d5284a9106) back on May 24th Balancer has earned ~$12k in protocol fees while[ spending ~$1.55M worth of BAL emissions](https://dune.com/tianqi/Balancer-Gauge-Weight). The CREAM gauge is the largest recipient of BAL emissions while returning virtually zero fee revenue to the protocol. Long term mechanisms like the recently passed [“core pools” proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x28bd2c5580f5a8effacdceb0aec52e9bc63987fa4f4a39f8b8223257ca4376cc) should help naturally correct this imbalance as market forces are given time to work though even in an optimistic scenario the CREAM gauge will remain very large for the foreseeable future.

Per [recent discussion](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/discussion-kill-cream-weth-gauge/3396) on the forum the community is split on this issue. Governance did approve the CREAM gauge in a legitimate vote and BAL was bought on the open market and locked in veBAL to vote for it. Governance also has the power to vote to kill any gauge for any reason and everyone participating in veBAL accepts these are the rules.

The Balancer ecosystem has significant funding requirements that currently far exceed our revenue generation based on the last 30 days. At this point in time the largest blocker to Balancer reaching sustainability is the existence of the CREAM gauge. There is enough support in the community for killing the gauge that it is appropriate to move this to a vote in my view - this proposal will be sent to the Governance Council for approval next Thursday, July 14th.

### Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `grantRole` on the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` with the following arguments:

role: `0xec1d467d9ab03a0079c22a89037209f5763aec973897ea763e2cf25d71a5f12e`
account: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`

The role can be verified [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json). This will give the DAO Multisig the ability to call `killGauge` on a pool's gauge. 

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will then call `killGauge` on the CREAM/WETH Gauge `0x9F65d476DD77E24445A48b4FeCdeA81afAA63480`",bullish

# Gyroscope <> Stader Labs Proposal for a 10% capped MaticX gauge

## Summary

> * **This is a proposal to enable a 10% capped Balancer gauge for a WMATIC/MATICX pool on Balancer Polygon.**
> 
> * **The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP) that is 65% more capital efficient than the largest, existing MATICX pool on Balancer.** E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens and it could generate significant trading volume.
> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split has been changed to be now as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.
> * **The pool is already [live](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xee278d943584dd8640eaf4cc6c7a5c80c0073e85000200000000000000000bc7).** A dashboard visualizing the past performance is [here](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/eclp-maticx-wmatic). Instead of adding direct SD incentives, Stader now wishes to tap into Balancer veBAL tokenomics and bribe for veBAL votes.

## Protocol description
> 
> * MATICX is a token that represents your share of the total MATIC pool deposited with Stader. As soon as you deposit MATIC on the Stader smart contract, you receive newly minted MATICX, based on the exchange rate at the time of staking. - [Stader](https://www.staderlabs.com/docs-v1/polygon/maticx#what-is-maticx)
> * wMATIC is a wrapped version of MATIC
> * The E-CLP uses an [internal conversion](https://github.com/gyrostable/vaults/blob/main/contracts/eclp/GyroECLPPool.sol#L723) to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.

## Motivation

> * **We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency by ˜65% compared to the largest, existing [StableSwap pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xe78b25c06db117fdf8f98583cdaaa6c92b79e917000000000000000000000b2b) with an amplification factor of 1000.** The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:
> 
> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.
>

742,"##### ABSTRACT
AIP ID #420 holds special importance within the crypto industry and the Ape community.

This proposal seeks to temporarily reserve AIP ID #420 to create a meaningful impact for the DAO. The proposal team would collaborate with the community to organize a competition where the winner is awarded AIP ID #420 and an ApeCoin grant.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The community engagement resulting from the decision and the decision-making process may enhance cohesion, excitement, and involvement among ApeCoin holders. This proposal would preserve the cultural significance of AIP-420 within the ApeCoin DAO.

##### OVERALL COST 
This proposal requests 420,000 ApeCoin from the DAO’s Ecosystem Fund for the community contest. The winner of the contest will be awarded with AIP #420 and a reasonable grant not exceeding 420,000 ApeCoin.

TLDR: We want to save AIP ID #420 to help give it a chance to create a meaningful impact for the DAO. The community would have a contest to award the AIP ID #420 along with a grant, this would be the first step to help ensure AIP ID #420 doesn’t end up in the Rejected AIPs folder.

#### PROPOSAL

Link to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-399-reserving-aip-id-420/21573/1

*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",bearish

A proposal to make parameter changes on TUSD for Aave v2 Ethereum. For more details, see the full forum post [here]( https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gauntlet-recommendation-on-tusd-for-aave-v2-ethereum/13727).


## Motivation

If the community views TUSD as having excess counterparty risk, we recommend iteratively lowering LT, LTV and/or freezing TUSD supply to begin off-boarding TUSD.


## Specification

This is a poll to gauge the community's preference:
- Option 1: iteratively lowering the LT of TUSD to 77.5%, LTV to 75%.
- Option 2: Freeze TUSD supply.
- Abstain
- Nay

Because these two options are not mutually exclusive, this is a multi-select poll so that community members can select multiple options.

This hurts PCS. This hurts defi.

A DEX needs liquidity. More emphasis needs to be placed on this. People don't understand that you make money even when there are NO Cake rewards. And PCS does not educate people in that regard.

However deincentivizing pools that have taken the time to be a part of the PCS ecosystem isn't the solution. 

As I've mentioned in a previous proposal...the only solution to keeping CAKE emissions as they are, yet still incentivizing more liquidity and pools is to create a token specifically for farming. One that is designed for the future. The current CAKE tokenomics does not support more liquidity. There is less than 0.5% of BTC on PCS...which speaks to how much growth potential there is...but if the BTC/BNB pool were to get 10X more liquidity the APR would be 0.9% at current prices. Taking what little CAKE reards from smaller projects to keep supporting the main pool s does not support innovation and long-term growth. 

Create a new token that requires you to
1. Hold a minimum amount of CAKE
2. Supports 10X liquidity growth while still giving compettive rewards
3. Support higher APR in ALL pools including the longterm pool

PCS is the best in the business at creating tokenmoics with burn mechanisms etc to prevent a dilution of the new token.",bearish

750,"The Venus community delegators are submitting this proposal on behalf of OpenZeppelin. 

Summary

OpenZeppelin has proposed a Security Partnership with Venus protocol for performing security audits on retainer. 

OpenZeppeling currently planned list of audits for Venus new product releases are:

-New Liquidator contract
-Diamond Comptroller
-Automatic allocation of income and Prime contract
-Collecting needed tokens and Shortfall handling (Automated Treasury Management)

As Venus’s trusted security partner, OpenZeppelin will perform continuous security audits of Venus codebases and provide actionable feedback to help the development team improve smart contract security. They offer a total of 24 weeks of security research time to be used over the next 6 months for audits as directed by the Venus dev team, which includes fix reviews and a high-level analysis of current protocol security. The total cost is $554,400 to be paid in USDC on a quarterly schedule from the Venus treasury, starting with $277,200 at the start of Q3 2023 followed by the same amount at the start of Q4.

About OpenZeppelin

OpenZeppelin is a leading blockchain infrastructure security firm that performs security audits and provides developer tools for decentralized systems that power multimillion-dollar economies. OpenZeppelin has set industry standards for building secure, decentralized systems and has gained the trust of industry leaders including Coinbase, the Ethereum Foundation, Matter Labs, and the original Compound protocol. OpenZeppelin built and maintains the world’s leading Open Source library for smart contract development with more than twenty millions downloads and 200 contributors.

OpenZeppelin has already seen success in security partnerships with DAOs including Compound, which forms the backbone of the Venus Protocol codebase. They have already leveraged their existing expertise in lending protocol security to audit the Venus SwapRouter and Oracles codebases for Venus in which they reported 25 total security issues. 

Partnership Offerings

Continuous Security Audits on Retainer: As Venus’s trusted security partner, OpenZeppelin will do a continuous security audit of our codebases. Unlike individual audit engagements, their security researchers will be assigned to work on Venus for the duration of this engagement. This provides scheduling flexibility, enhances auditor knowledge of Venus codebase and builds a more collaborative client-auditor relationship to produce better results. In addition to formal auditing, OpenZeppelin will offer Venus protocol security advisory on Web3 best practices to improve secure code development going forward.

## Service Provider Name

Wonderland (defi.sucks)

## Overview

We're a group of developers, researchers, and data scientists with one thing in common: we all love building cool sh*t. [DeFi sucks](https://defi.sucks/), but we are here to make it better.

Our mission is to discover, partner with, and empower innovators to create open, permissionless, decentralized financial solutions. We pledge to stand by our partners, working with and supporting them in every way possible.

We’re partners with some of the most relevant and successful protocols in web3, including Optimism, Aztec, Connext, Yearn, Reflexer, and more.

We think of Balancer as the leader in AMM innovation, with a history of building features that many other protocols adapt later down the road.

## Leader(s)

Wonderland comprises a team of 30+ experienced developers and researchers, with [Matias Nisenson](https://twitter.com/MatiasNisenson) as CEO and [0xGorilla](https://twitter.com/0xGorillaDev) as CTO. Find the whole team here: https://defi.sucks/squad

## **Adhere to [[BIP-372]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009) and the SP standards:**

Yes

## **Domains of Operation:**

Wonderland is a proficient web3-first development team with a lot of experience in cross-chain, automation, oracles, and DeFi, with a strong focus on smart contracts, front ends, and system design. We’re the team behind:

- [Connext optimistic roots](https://github.com/connext?q=&type=all&language=&sort=): saving gas costs by 90% on the merkle tree.
- [xERC20](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/xERC20): a standard for bridged tokens.
- [Keep3r Network redesign](https://github.com/keep3r-network/keep3r-network-v2): we helped completely remove liquidity management devops costs.
- [Hai Stablecoin](https://github.com/hai-on-op): the money-god mandate is to be everywhere, so we made a highly complex protocol as developer-friendly as possible for others to build on top of it and fork it.
- [Price](https://github.com/price-oracle): a permissionless and reliable oracle that provides safe token price quotes, showcasing what can be built on AMMs.

Our initial focus is on smart contract development for v3. We’ll bring every bit of the experience above to the table, helping Balancer lower its gas consumption and maintenance costs while having the best developer experience possible for those building on top of v3.

We understand Balancer has a mature ecosystem with multiple service providers and stakeholders committed to its success; we’d be more than happy to engage and collaborate with any of them in any aspect of the protocol where we can help.

## **Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**

**Development of Balancer v3:**

For the past month, we’ve been working with Balancer Labs, getting to know the codebase and supporting some current developments around the upcoming v3 release. Some of the things we’ve done so far are:

- Optimizing current design for gas efficiency.
- Researching designs to support emerging token standards like the ERC4626.
- Improving the test suite to provide a test-oriented approach.
- Security patterns and helping reduce trust assumptions.
- Providing feedback on upcoming peripheral products.

We believe code is art; you want every line to have a *raison d'être*, which can make it more gas-efficient and helps security auditors, or even users, to go through it and have a sense of what’s happening quickly, among other things.

**Balancer as the tip of the spear in innovation:**

We believe there’s a lot of innovation going on in the AMM space, like with the recent boom of hooks after Uni v4, research around Loss-Versus-Rebalancing, or the increasing relevance of aggregators. This is all in the spirit of having the best and most efficient experience for the liquidity provider and the end-user.

We want to help Balancer stay at the forefront of innovation and experimentation as a customizable and advanced AMM.

Keep in mind that as our collaboration with Balancer extends over time, our goals will evolve to focus on what's most crucial for the success of the Balancer ecosystem.

## What our current partners have to say

*Don’t trust, verify*. These are quotes from a few of our partners and founders who have worked with us for extended periods and can attest to our quality and commitment.

“*Wonderland was wonderful to work with. They aren't cheap but they do excellent work. They went above and beyond their assignment and even found & fixed a bug in a related system, following our communication guidelines for risk mitigation at every step. 10/10 would recommend*.”

**Ameen, founder @Reflexer**

""*Wonderland is an incredibly talented technical team that takes a radically different approach to how they work with protocols. They are a close partner & core contributor to the Connext ecosystem, taking a proactive leadership role in not only building, but also helping determine what the future of the network will look like. I strongly recommend them to anyone looking for a high integrity, high quality partner*.""

**Arjun, founder @ Connext**

“*The Wonderland team has been instrumental in helping us push the design space for Aztec and think better about the types of contracts that can be built on Aztec.  They are knowledgeable, motivated, and efficient in their work.*”

**Joe, founder  @Aztec**

""*Great working together, if I could, I would have them run the protocol full time, complete trust*”

**Andre Cronje**

“*I always enjoy collaborating with Wonderland. They have a wide understanding of the defi space, its needs and problems, and they have right skills to solve them. They've developed one of the most widely used plugins for Hardhat and are always willing to help the defi/Ethereum space.*”

**Patricio, founder @Nomic Labs**

## **Length of Engagement & Budget:**

We’re proposing a 4-year long engagement, starting March 14, 2024, with the following structure:

- $30,000/month in USDC.
- An allocation of 275,000 BAL tokens vested linearly over four years starting February 14.
- A call option with no expiry for 175,000 BAL with a 30-day TWAP strike price at the time of approval of this proposal, vested linearly over four years.
- Entity to exercise call options: OpCo / Foundation multi-sig at `0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693`.
- Specific terms and conditions apply as per real-world contract which will be drafted by the foundation.
- Quarterly updates under this thread for the duration of the engagement.

There will be a team of 4 full time developers working on Balancer, with additional support from Wonderland’s research team and the rest of the company.

Since our main expertise lies in code, that's where we shine brightest. However, our incentives are perfectly aligned, and we're fully committed to supporting in every way possible, including business development, communications, or security, whenever we have the capacity and it aligns with our capabilities. Rest assured, we're about going the extra mile for our partners, always ready to contribute beyond our core if we can.

**Termination terms**

Both parties may terminate this agreement at any time effective immediately upon 15-days prior written notice to the other party due to any failure of either party’s obligations under what’s stated in this proposal. In this case, Wonderland would receive a partial payout of the monthly USDC transfer, and the DAO would execute a clawback on the BAL vested, starting from the effective date of termination.

## Protocol Description
CoW Protocol lets people swap assets MEV protected at the best exchange rate by leveraging its batch settlement layer built on top of DeFi’s favorite AMMs and DEX Aggregators. Instead of directly executing trades on-chain, users only sign their swap intention and delegate the execution to so-called solvers (aka relayers in other protocols). Solvers bid on the best possible exchange rate in order to win the right to settle trades. By batching multiple trades together in order to create CoWs (Coincidence of Wants), solvers can save on gas costs, AMM fees and execution risk. Therefore CoWs lead to structurally better prices than on any existing DEX aggregator. In the absence of CoWs solvers fall back to using the best possible on-chain route, by comparing quotes from leading aggregators.

## Motivation
Strengthen the COW and BAL communities ties by giving a reward in COW tokens for veBAL voters, while increasing BAL rewards to COW liquidity providers. More in CowDAO proposal [here](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-using-cow-to-boost-bal-rewards-for-cow-lps/783)

## Specification

1.  **Governance**: CowDAO is governed by COW and vCOW token holders through snapshot votes and forum proposals. 

2.  **Oracles**: No use of oracles in CoW Protocol

3.  **Audits**: Settlement contract [audits](https://github.com/gnosis/gp-v2-contracts/tree/main/audits). COW token [audits](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-token/tree/main/audits).

4.  **Centralization vectors**: Orderbook and solver competition are still hosted on a server although decentralizing this part of the stack is on the roadmap. The potential risk is mainly censorship of orders. No user funds are at custody. Limit prices are enforced by an immutable smart contract. 

5.  **Market History**: COW was made transferable on March 28th and was launched with [incentives to provide liquidity on Balancer](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-4-cow-liquidity-incentive-program/295/20) pools. CowDAO is [considering](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-using-cow-to-boost-bal-rewards-for-cow-lps/783) using the veBAL voting system to boost BAL rewards for COW pools.",bearish
754,"TL;DR
We seek community input on allowing bootstrap delegates to be eligible for grant funding. 

Background
1. 0xDAO is established with a seed-funded Treasury and nine bootstrap delegates, who have delegated voting power
2. 0xEVE is approved as an experimental initiative to actively drive value creation and capture for the 0x protocol ecosystem
3. 0xEVE publishes a framework to process and award grants, either directly from its own budget or from the Treasury via an onchain vote

A question has arisen as to whether delegates should be eligible for grants. 

On one hand, delegates are some of the most active, personally committed, and technically qualified to successfully perform work that falls within the grant parameters and it would be against our interest to preclude them from doing so. 

On the other hand, there is the potential for real or perceived conflict of interest, influence, or favoritism. We need to strike a balance that enables us to resource and reward deserving proposals, while also ensuring the integrity of the process. 

We are unaware of other protocols explicitly making contributors and/or delegates ineligible for grants.  

Recommendation
1. Delegates must disclose if they are potentially a beneficiary of any grant
2. Delegates must abstain from any vote in which they are a potential beneficiary

Action Required
Discuss in the forum and signal support or non-support via a snapshot vote. Forum post: https://gov.0x.org/t/delegate-grant-eligibility/973

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Add to rETH Holding
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & @DefiJesus + ACI - @MarcZeller 
created: 2023-10-14

# Summary

This publication proposes acquiring rETH with ETH held in the DAO's Ethereum Treasury.

# Abstract

This publication proposes converting a portion of the wETH, awETH and wEthWETH held in the Treasury to rETH.

A balance of 100 aEthWETH will remain in the Treasury to facilitate on going DAO expenses such as the [Quarterly Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680) and any other future expense that arise.

# Motivation

At the time of writing the Aave DAO has the following assets in the Ethereum Treasury:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 14.56 |22,543.32|
|awETH|530.39|820,829.60|
|aEthWETH|510.45 | 789,962.05|

The following assets are available to be claimed from the Paraswap Legacy Fees and Fee Claimer contract:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 4.53 |7,011.99|
|wETH| 10.8 |16,717.32|

This publication proposes converting all wETH, awETH and all but 100 aEthWETH to rETH. The 100 aEthWETH is to remain to support on going DAO funding. 

The table below shows the yield differential between the various assets:

|Asset|Yield (%)| 
| --- | --- | 
|wETH| 0.00|
|awETH|1.26|
|aEthWETH|1.97 |
|rETH|3.07|

Based upon current market conditions, the additional yield generated by converting the assets as outlined to rETH is $23,266.50. 

Upon implementation of this [ARFC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-aave-v3-eth-pool-weth-parameters/15110), the additional yield generated is ~$654.42, for the conservative and ~$2,782.86, for the aggressive approach due to the reduction in deposit rates of approximately 10.3 bps and 33.5bps respectively. This does not take into consideration how the market will then adjust after the ETH v3 interst rate parameters are changed. 

# Specification

The following is to be performed:

* Deposit all wETH into aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH)
* Withdraw all awETH (Aave V2 wETH) into ETH
* Withdraw all but 100 aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH) into ETH
* Deposit ETH into RocketPool's rETH
* Transfer rETH into collector

761,"This proposal whitelists the Apollo Vault addresses for OSMO/WBTC and OSMO/WETH for ForceUnlocking, enabling liquidation events to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within.

What are Vaults?
Vaults are a key piece of infrastructure required to enable leveraged yield farming on Osmosis.

Vaults allow users to deposit tokens to be managed by a protocol and enable access to yield strategies offered by that protocol.

Leveraged Liquidity Positions require depositing assets into a vault which then provides liquidity on a user's behalf. These assets may then be used as collateral via Mars' Rover Credit Accounts to increase the value of the liquidity provided. The vault also auto-compounds rewards into the pool to maximise yield.

In the event of the pool's value dropping below a declared safety threshold and the position being liquidated, the collateralised assets within the vault are required to be automatically sold. As these assets will be locked in order to receive liquidity incentives this is not possible without allowing the vault addresses to directly bypass this restriction and unlock assets immediately rather than waiting for the bonding period to pass.

Apollo LP Vaults have been audited by Oak Security and the audit report can be found here.

Implementation
This proposal directly whitelists the address to be able to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within them, enabling the liquidation of over-leveraged deposits.

764,"[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum.](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-for-batch-2-of-ecosystem-fund-grants/522)

Now that Batch #1 is complete and the results have been [reported to the community](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/summary-batch-1-of-ecosystem-fund-grants/503), I’d like to propose the allocation of 50K BAL from the Ecosystem Fund for a second batch of grants.

Grants will continue to play a vital role in the growth of the Balancer ecosystem. They are a powerful mechanism to attract and reward high quality projects and services from the community that increase the utility of the Balancer protocol and the vibrancy of our community.

As in [Batch #1](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/first-batch-of-balancer-ecosystem-fund-grants/127),

> Balancer Labs will be responsible for deciding on the specific grant distribution to avoid governance micromanaging the decision process for each single grant. After a grant batch is fully allocated (if there is some left-over, it will be added to the following batch), a report with the grant allocation in that batch will be released to the community and a request for approval of a new batch will be voted on. This dynamics ensures that Balancer Labs has to do a good job at grant distribution since if this is not the case a new batch of grants might not be approved.

**Proposal**

Allocate 50K BAL from Balancer Labs to a variety of teams and individuals who build value-creating projects or provide vital services for the Balancer protocol and community.

Grant sizes equal to or below 1,000 BAL will receive 100% liquid BAL tokens.
Grant sizes above 1,000 BAL will receive BAL tokens that are subject to a 1 year vesting period.

Recipients of vesting grants will also have the option to supply ETH to pair with their granted BAL, converting the grant into the 80/20 BAL/ETH BPT, thus earning compounding fees during the vesting period.

The vesting policy is intended to simultaneously ensure that:

1. We are providing a strong incentive for top-notch developers, service providers, and other community members to contribute their energy to Balancer.
2. We are strongly aligning long-term interests with partners with whom we enter large agreements.",bullish

        5% to support bveCVX/CVX LP emissions
        5% to support BADGER/WBTC CVX & CRV yield 
- Rewards from the bribe selling would be distributed in 75% bveCVX / 25% Badger.
- bveCVX would keep participating in the Boost as native balance per BIP 85 3 and also would become available as collateral on Rari while keeping the rewards and the Boost power.
- Stop distributing Badger and cvxCRV from the emissions schedule to bveCVX unless it’s deemed cost-efficient to buy the vote weight from it.

766,"Dear Uniswap Community,

The Voltz Labs team recently submitted a proposal to request for an “Additional Use Grant” from Uniswap governance. This would allow Voltz to use aspects of the Uniswap v3 code that is subject to the “Business Source License”.

Voltz is a new DeFi primitive, bringing interest rate swaps to DeFi in a manner that is up to 3000x more capital efficient than alternative models. Voltz, therefore, is not a competitor to Uniswap but instead is complementary; interest rate swaps are a core pillar of well-functioning financial systems - so as Voltz grows it should help DeFi grow, which in turn should have second order benefits to Uniswap.

That said, the Voltz Labs team recognise the significant R&D that went into v3 and as a result are offering Uniswap governance 1% of Voltz future tokens alongside a number of additional non-financial benefits. The full proposal, and discussion, can be found here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/should-uniswap-provide-voltz-with-v3-additional-use-grant/15669?u=simonj

**Protocol Description:**

BetSwirl aims to be the web3 casino where users owns a share of the house, and are rewarded a share of its revenue (30%) via the BETS token.
The historic price is shown on [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/betswirl) and [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/betswirl/).

**Motivation:**

Due to the Multichain issue, we’ve recently migrated to [BETS v2](https://etherscan.io/token/0x94025780a1ab58868d9b2dbbb775f44b32e8e6e5) (same contract address on Ethereum, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Avalanche and Polygon). And to address BETS v1 liquidity fragmentation (we had 4 LP on each chains), we migrated 100% of BetSwirl’s Owned Extractable Liquidity (from Polygon, Arbitrum, BNB Chain and Avalanche) to the Balancer Ethereum pool.
**Now we are also considering having POL on Arbitrum.**

We’d like **Core Pool** incentives because the pool is paired with 20% wstETH (with a rate provider). A 2% capped gauge would be appropriate for now given our AUM.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** BetSwirl isn’t in DAO mode yet, but we’re investigating the ways to transition.

4. **Centralization vectors:** The core team is responsible to dispatch the staking rewards.
5. **Market History:** BETS v1 TGE was [date=2022-03-15]. Volatility on BETS v1 was due to our liquidity being fragmented ($200k of extractable liquidity was dispatched across 4 chains on 50/50 pairs).

Avalanche: Signal for deployment

Summary

The Avalanche Foundation asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into Avalanche.

Proposer

The Avalanche Foundation is dedicated to supporting the Avalanche ecosystem and related technologies. The Foundation is part of a larger Avalanche ecosystem and working with other organizations to support the significant development of Avalanche-related technologies.

Avalanche is one of the fastest smart contracts platforms in the blockchain industry, as measured by time-to-finality, and has the most validators securing its activity of any proof-of-stake protocol. Avalanche’s C-Chain is an instance of the EVM running with Avalanche’s consensus.

Rationale

Current status of the Avalanche C-Chain: The Avalanche network is secured by over 1,000 validators and is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of Avalanche consensus. While maintaining this level of decentralization, the network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 1-2 seconds, making the network’s C-Chain an incredible playground for DeFi and other EVM applications. The ecosystem already has a slew of native projects offering exchange, lending, and aggregation services, over $1.5bn bridged from Ethereum, over $2.2bn in TVL, and protocols such as SushiSwap and Curve deployed or in the process of deploying.

Why it is good for the Aave ecosystem: The Avalanche blockchain is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, and near-instant finality. Through the Avalanche Rush program, the Avalanche foundation has allocated up to $20M AVAX for users of the Aave protocol over a three-month period to earn AVAX rewards while using Aave on Avalanche for the first phase of the program. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established Avalanche community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on established chains like Avalanche will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.

Why signaling is necessary? Consistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, he Avalanche Foundation believes that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on – and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. The Avalanche Rush announcement received a lot of interest from both the Aave and Avalanche communities. Deploying the Aave protocol on Avalanche will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.

Next Steps

Creation of Snapshot vote for the Aave community to signal YES/NO for deployment on Avalanche.

Graphic tees transform into motion graphic tees; street art unlocks interactive NFTs; trading cards become living highlight reels; album covers reveal hidden songs & lyrics; IRL events bring digital to the physical. All powered by ApeCoin.

#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:
##### Community Benefit #1: Access to State-of-the-Art Technology, Tools & Resources for Creative Entrepreneurs
- State-of-the-art AR technology is cost prohibitive for most independent artists & creatives. Since 2019, my company has been powering app-less AR experiences for brands, solving friction-laden user experience problems. Therefore, this proposal would fund the ability to empower accepted applicants with our already built zero-code, zero-download AR software used by brands from Paramount Pictures to Compass Real Estate.
- Along with this technology, we provide the advisory resources for the Launchpad participants to follow best practices & achieve success with their physical-meets-digital releases.
- This proposal then empowers creatives & furthers the entrepreneurial ecosystem that is Web3. Each project that emerges from the Ape.AR Launchpad
will produce an augmented product or experience, with a requisite to incorporate $APE as its exclusive currency.

##### Community Benefit #2: Augmented Utility for Collectors
- Through collecting NFTs, I quickly realized that AR technology can even further solve key problems endemic to the Web3 ecosystem. Specifically, it can be leveraged to bridge multiple divides: between physical and digital, between story and product, between online & IRL. In aggregate, this also solves the collector’s greatest concern by offering cohesive, comprehensive, continual utility.
- Both a connection to and extension of the jpeg itself, our AR technology can take any still object, location, or image, regardless of where it appears, bringing it to life with motion and sound. 2D & 3D animations, video, audio, rich text, 360 portals. Once static artworks become dynamic & life-like with personality, stories & journeys.
- Even further, all of the digital layers can be updated anytime, over time, real-time. This presents the potential for utility, or continuous value, in perpetuity. Augmented, unfolding stories. These stories can be strictly narrative, practical like early access to NFT drops, or a combination. Content drops layered onto physical product drops.

##### Community Benefit #3: Onboarding New Web3 Participants
- An indirect consequence of bridging the physical & digital divide with AR may eventually become its most important Web3 legacy: bridging the world of NFT early adopters & the rest of the world.
- Products like motion graphic tees & experiences like interactive murals expose new audiences to the digital art we experience daily in Web3. But instead of leading with the technicalities of NFTs & blockchain, we lead with the visual stories - what the tokens represent - as digital layers to our physical realities. Newcomers get immersed in the intrinsic value of art before the financial value of art. Actual appreciation before financial appreciation. True, authentic, sustainable onboarding.
- Then, given our layered approach to AR, newcomers can be presented with options to collect the motion art at the point of experience via available frictionless NFT solutions.
- This expansive & inclusive worldview results in expanding the Web3 ecosystem to include new, interested & eventually active participants.

##### Community Benefit #4: ApeCoin Commerce
- $APE will be the exclusive payment method for all of the Ape.AR Launchpad collections. All of the resulting products will also include a “Powered by ApeCoin” logo.
- Through this physical-meets-digital new use case, Ape.AR will generate new demand for $APE. This benefits the entire community, serving the vision of ApeCoin as the currency of choice for creative capital in Web3. A flywheel effect takes place when Ape.AR Launchpad projects successfully go to market & generate even greater interest for ApeCoin DAO.

#### OVERALL COST

$300,000 USD, payable in $APE

775,"# Summary
1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

This proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.

# Motivations
Launched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):

Total trading volume: $160B
Total swaps: 5.91M
Total users: 1.25M

1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.

The mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.

In December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.

# Benefits to Aave Community

1INCH is highly liquid.
1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.
1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.
1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.

# Specification
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
RoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3

3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.

1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.

1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.

On the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

The 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.

1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.

1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.

1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.

P2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.
1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.

Supported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.

# How is the asset currently used?

1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3

#Emission schedule

The 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.

Of the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).

Uncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).

# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability

The smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.

The 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.

## General

The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.

* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.
* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.
* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.
  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.
  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.
  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.

The 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.

## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:

The 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M

The 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.

The 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.

On April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.

## 1INCH Counterparty Risk:

1inch is a permissionless protocol where 1INCH holders do not have a say in how the protocol or DAO is governed.

Holders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program.

The st1INCH token is used for governing the DAO and although there is no revenue sharing like with xSUSHI there are economic rewards/incentives for those who hold the token. st1INCH token holders receive up to 100% of gas expenses refunded, depending on your stake size. Under this program, 1INCH tokens are distributed as a gas refund to Ethereum users who stake 1INCH tokens through the 1INCH dApp. Borrowing 1INCH with the intent to receive a gas refund is a useful utility.

Users who stake 1INCH receive st1INCH which is non transferrable and used for governance. If a malicious actor was to borrow 1INCH, stake to receive st1INCH and then try attack the DAO’s treasury, then the Treasury Multisig 7 of 12 can veto the proposal during the 72 hour timelock period post successful Snapshot vote. This measure provides a level of protection for the DAO’s Treasury funds which are nominated in USDC. Any malicious attack on the DAO Treasury would not lead to the actor selling 1INCH on-market and this scenario would not create bad debt by moving the spot price of 1INCH.

780,"Proposal to add support for stMATIC on Aave V3 Polygon market

Overview

This is a proposal to add stMATIC to the Polygon v3 market.

Aave governance recently added stETH to the Ethereum v2 market with great success, having a market size of $1.43 billion. The stMATIC token is similar but differs in one important aspect. Instead of being a rebasing token like stETH, it simply becomes more expensive over time relative to MATIC as it accrues yield.

Since Aave governance enjoyed stETH, I would venture to guess they will like stMATIC as well.

In addition, this will unlock leveraged MATIC yield positions similar to the ETHMAXY token by the Galleon DAO (https://blog.galleon.community/the-eth-max-yield-index-is-live-on-ethereum-df6dc9bbc5b4?gi=970b8b8e4f52).

Background

PoLido is a DAO governed liquid staking protocol for the Polygon PoS chain. It allows users to stake their MATIC tokens on the Ethereum mainnet and immediately get the representation of their share in the form of stMATIC token without maintaining staking infrastructure. Users will get staking rewards and still control and utilize their stMATIC tokens in secondary markets on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon.

MATIC tokens will be delegated across validators that are registered and accepted by the DAO inside PoLido protocol.

Node operators don’t have direct access to the delegated assets. They are just providing infrastructure and getting rewards in return. Assets are controlled by PoLido core smart contracts exclusively.

The goal is to help with Polygon decentralization and integrate stMATIC with the variety of protocols and DeFi applications on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon PoS chain.

In short, Lido for Polygon is enabling users to:

Stake their MATIC tokens in a decentralized and secure way
Use their stMATIC on the secondary market
Do all of the above simply and easily with a click of a button on the UI
Additional value PoLido can bring to the Polygon ecosystem is decentralizing stake distribution, and getting more capital efficiency in the ecosystem — enabling staked MATIC to participate in DeFi on Polygon.

stMATIC token
Polygonscan Link:
https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3a58a54c066fdc0f2d55fc9c89f0415c92ebf3c4

stMATIC is an ERC20 token that represents the account’s share of the total suuply of MATIC tokens inside PoLido system. It is a non-rebasable token, which means that the amount of tokens in the user’s wallet is not going to change. During time, the value of this token is changing, since the amount of MATIC tokens inside the protocol is not constant.

Paramenters
Using the relative parameter adjustments between ETH and stETH, I propose the following for stMATIC. These will be subject to change with more discussion. 

Max LTV: 55%
Liquidation threshold: 62%
Liquidation penalty: 15%

**Title**: *[ARFC] BGD. Security budget request - December 2023*

**Author**: *BGD Labs (@bgdlabs)*

**Date**: *2023-12-8*

---

## Summary
Request for a budget of $121’200 for 2 security review procedures on Aave, together with a refund of $30’000 to BGD for the Aave Governance v3 extra voting tokens audit.A


**Amounting a grand total of $151'200**.


## Motivation
Part of [our scope Aave <> BGD Phase II](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-bored-ghosts-developing-phase-2/14484#scope-6) is the planning, engagement, and coordination with security partners of the DAO.

During the previous year and a half, Aave was in a pretty intensive delivery phase (Aave v3 improvements, GHO, Aave Governance v3, a.DI), and we thought it was appropriate to have continuous engagement with 2 security firms like Certora and SigmaPrime.

Even if this worked well, and [we still think that Certora should stay with a continuous engagement](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-continuous-security-proposal-aave-certora/15732/4), we also think that there is room for optimisation, and it is a good idea to do more ad-hoc requests for the security budget, depending on the needs.

This ARFC is an initial request, for budget required in the short term on item part of our development services scope, together with another more general we consider pretty important.

## Specification
This request has 3 components, which we want to explain to the community:

---

**1. Compensation for Mixbytes review of Governance v3 tokens**

During the activation of Aave Governance v3 on October 17th, we detected a problem with the voting assets, which required the cancellation of the proposal, the development of a fix, and re-apply security procedures.

Given that it was already audited code, we also decided to do an extra security review by another security firm, Mixbytes.

For the sake of speed and reducing bureaucratic blockers, **BGD paid for the cost of said security review of $30’000, and now we will include on this proposal a refund request for that amount**.

---

**2. Compensation for security review on a feature of Aave 3.1**

Also part of our Phase 2 scope is to do a series of improvements to Aave v3, in order to reach a 3.1 version, from the current 3.0.2.

Generally, we are confident with Certora reviewing all the planned items until now, but there is one exception (an specific feature) to which we thought an extra review was required, and we engaged Emanuele Ricci (@StErMi), a top-level security researcher with knowledge of Aave to do it.
We will be publishing soon everything to be included into v3.1.

Same as with Mixbytes, BGD has paid the cost of said security review of $12’000, and now we include the refund request on this proposal.

---

**3. Engagement with Spearbit for Aave v3 ad-hoc review**

Aave v2/v3 is a production system with billions of dollars in size, and one of the most evaluated protocols security-wise.
However, security is a continuous process, and always worth it to improve whenever it feels necessary.

During the last 1-2 months, we have noticed different security exploits in the space following similar patterns. None of them affected Aave, but apart from our continuous analysis of the system security-wise, we think it is necessary to do an extra round of review in critical parts of Aave, for additional assurance.

We have coordinated an engagement for this review scope with Spearbit, one of the leading security firms in the space, that will involve 3 of their top researchers checking in-depth different components that we identify as critical on Aave.

This engagement is scheduled to start in the second part of December, and different from the others, the payment requested in the proposal will be direct to Spearbit, for an amount of $109’200.

---

From a technical perspective:
- The proposal will send $42'000 to BGD as compensation for the expenses of part 1) and 2).
- $109'200 will be sent to a Spearbit wallet, to compensate for the services to be provided on part 3).

*The final addresses and stablecoins of the treasury to use will be included in the AIP stage, previous coordination about the last with contributors to the financial area of the Aave DAO*",bullish
782,"**Summary:**
> Proposal to add gauge support for a newly created qETH/ETH pool on Ethereum.

**Protocol Description:**

>Tranchess is a yield-enhancing asset tracker launched on BNB Chain in June 2021. It launched its BNB liquid staking fund in January 2022 with its own validator node and is now one of the top protocols on the BNB Chain. 

>Tranchess’ fund structure comprises one main fund, known as the QUEEN token, and two tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. QUEEN tracks the underlying asset's price and earns enhanced yield with features such as yield farming and liquid staking. QUEEN can be split evenly into two sub-tranches, BISHOP and ROOK. BISHOP is a stablecoin-like token that earns a steady yield by lending its underlying position to ROOK. ROOK is a token with a built-in leveraged position to the underlying asset without the risk of forced liquidation.

>Tranchess currently runs three asset-tracking funds: BTC, ETH and BNB on the BNB Chain, and is launching its first ETH liquid staking fund on Ethereum on Nov. 25th. qETH is the liquid-staked ETH from the Tranchess Beacon chain staking system. For the convenience of future collaboration with other Ethereum protocols, qETH is designed so that the staking rewards of staked ETH is reflected as a change in the fair value of qETH, instead of a change in the number of qETH tokens. The qETH token amount would only change if users stake/unstake additional ETH with Tranchess. The proposed pool, qETH/ETH, allows users to swap between qETH and ETH, as redemption is currently not supported on the Ethereum Beacon chain. 

**Motivation:**

> The qETH/ETH pool is the cornerstone of the Tranchess ETH liquid staking product on Ethereum. Currently, the BNB liquid staking fund of Tranchess earns a total yield between 11.2%~27.9%, a combination of Tranchess staking earning of CHESS (Tranchess governance token) and PoS staking. With the ETH liquid staking fund, Tranchess aims to provide a similar enhanced yield for users on Ethereum, and the qETH/ETH pool is an essential feature to a smooth user experience.

>A veBAL gauge incentivizes users to participate and would help quickly build up the liquidity of the pool at the beginning stage for a smoother swapping experience. The pool would naturally grow with the protocol, and we expect to facilitate the incentivization with Hidden Hand and the Balancer bribing narrative.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Tranchess’ governance token is CHESS, which users earn by staking with Tranchess platform. CHESS holders can vote on various governance items, such as the staking earning split between BISHOP and ROOK, the weekly CHESS emission split among different funds, and can collect a weekly rebate of the protocol fees. CHESS holders also vote through Tranchess’s snapshot on proposals which are discussed and raised on the [TranchessForum](https://forum.tranchess.com/).   

2. **Oracles:** Tranchess adopts Chainlink as the price oracle.

3. **Audits:** Tranchess has done multiple audits since launching as we continuously develop and improve the protocol. The most recent audit report can be found [here](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-TranchessV2.1-v1.0.pdf). Additionally, Tranchess runs a [bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/tranchess/) with Immunefi.

4. **Centralization vectors:**
The token is not upgradeable or pausable.
The owner has limited minting capabilities and cannot blacklist the contract.
Tranchess ETH liquid staking is a decentralized ETH2 liquid staking product collectively runs by the Tranchess dev team and node operators.


5. **Market History:** Link to the pool: [0xC9C5Ff67bB2Fae526aE2467C359609D6BCb4c532](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC9C5Ff67bB2Fae526aE2467C359609D6BCb4c532)

6. **Value:** The qETH/ETH pool would be the primary source of liquidity for Tranchess ETH liquid staking fund, a first stop that all Tranchess users would visit when staking with Tranchess. The pool organically grows with Tranchess ETH liquid staking volume, contributing to the Balancer community.

783,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-v2-authorize-gauntlet-network-to-set-swap-fees/1799).

The Balancer V2 core smart contracts were deployed to mainnet earlier this week, and the full UI launch is right around the corner. In the final days leading up to the launch, the core dev team at Balancer Labs intends for the Balancer Governance Multisig to execute additional authorizations on chain. But Balancer Labs has no decision-making power over the Multisig, which is strictly governed by BAL holders. 

The authorization to be ratified by this proposal would enable Gauntlet Network to set swap fees on certain pools which have opted into the feature.

## Motivation

One of the exciting features planned for Balancer V2 is **dynamically optimized swap fees** powered by **Gauntlet Network**. These dynamic fees help to boost returns for liquidity providers by adapting to changing market conditions, while also reducing the pool design space by consolidating multiple potential pools into a single fee strategy.

But this feature is only made possible by granting Gauntlet's smart contract ([`0xE4a8ed6c1D8d048bD29A00946BFcf2DB10E7923B`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE4a8ed6c1D8d048bD29A00946BFcf2DB10E7923B#code)) **authorization to change the swap fee** on certain pools. This authorization applies only to pools using the delegated owner address (`0xBA1BA1ba1BA1bA1bA1Ba1BA1ba1BA1bA1ba1ba1B`); **pool creators retain the ability to opt out** of Gauntlet-powered fees by setting the owner to their own EOA, a smart contract, or the zero address for immutability. Even for pools which have opted in, Gauntlet's power would extend to the swap fee and **only the swap fee**; Gauntlet cannot alter any other attributes of the pool.

## Specification

The Balancer Governance Multisig would submit 1 transaction as follows. Here, ""Multisig"" refers to the Gnosis Safe at `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` and ""Authorizer"" is the smart contract deployed this week at [`0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6#code).

Since ultra sound cake project started locked cakes decreased a lot and many investors decided to leave no matter how huge achievent was this.

Recently i read that millions of cakes where moved to third party projects because pf the benefits and the rewards.

786,"What is Pocket Network:

Pocket is a decentralized RPC protocol with a permissionless network of over 45.000 incentivized nodes. This gives us the best resilience in the market with latency comparable to leading centralized providers, while being decentralized. Dapps that use Pocket Network’s RPC get to own their service and the more they use it, the cheaper it gets. As opposed to other providers, rather than paying a monthly fee that is a recurring cost, Dapps using Pocket get allocated RPC service based on a POKT stake, which allows them to own their infra in a liquid way. By using Pocket, Aave will be actively incentivizing decentralization as the more traffic is served by the network, more rewards are generated, causing more nodes to be spun up for the chains in question.

Rationale:

We have learned that Aave currently uses a basket of public RPCs for servicing the end user relays. Team members have expressed the desire to improve this solution as it is not very stable and there are recurring problems in service from these different public RPCs. This is especially problematic for mainnet ETH & Polygon for which POKT provides dedicated RPCs.

By providing Pocket Endpoints to Aave’s user facing RPC we can improve the RPC service level (both latency and % uptime) and contribute to Aave’s decentralization by providing it with the most decentralized infrastructure in the market, making it more resilient and censorship resistant, while allowing Aave to own their service through its stake.

We have developed a contract and method based permissioning method that will be implemented for AAVE’s endpoint, so that it can only be used to interact with AAVE protocol.

Proposal:

We believe a good start is to provide this service with an app stake that’s good for 25M relays (won’t get rate limited if exceeded) and later ramp up depending on performance, user feedback and how much the DAO is willing to invest.

Pocket Network would stake 118,815 POKT on behalf of AAVE DAO. This would be funded as follows:

Budget:

25M Relays:

$POKT 118,815

$POKT price at time of posting: $0.138 USD per POKT

Total: $16,396.47 USD

Goals:

1) Improve stability in Aave’s public facing Web3 infrastructure.
2) Decentralization of Aave’s front end RPC.
3) Give Aave ownership of its RPC service via owning the POKT token.
4) Further promote decentralization in the Aave and crypto communities.
5) Raise awareness of Pocket’s service and mission to decentralize web3 infra.
6) Encourage other projects to decentralize their infra with Pocket Network.

Milestones:

1) Integration: Integration of Aave with Pocket via inclusion of a simple URL addition
2) Onboarding/Testing: Testing of the Pocket Network endpoint. Tech support provided by Pocket engineers
3) Ramp up: Allocation of a certain % (equivalent to 25M Relays) of Aave traffic to Pocket Network
4) Increase of % and Pokt stake if service is performing as desired;
Proposal content in short

We propose an addition of Aave’s frontend RPCs to Pocket Network, in order to solve stability problems currently experienced in the use of public RPC’s (especially on mainnet), as expressed by the community.

We are offering an endpoint with a stake for 25M relays that won’t get rate limited and to be ramped up in a phased manner.

To fund this we are asking the AAVE community the funds to buy 118,815 $POKT which will represent their service stake, allowing for AAVE to send up to 25M Relays per day.",bearish

## Summary

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient.
The protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. 

agEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there.

At the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero.

There are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/polygon/pools/0x3fa147d6309abeb5c1316f7d8a7d8bd023e0cd80) and on [Curve](https://polygon.curve.fi/factory/209). 
Besides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.

Stablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism.

The stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).
The protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.

agEUR has a Chainlink feed on Polygon with USD.

## Audits

We have had four different audits which can be found [here](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits)

## Benefits for Aave V3

agEUR is already supported in efficiency mode with other stablecoins which should technically allow people to take leverage on Forex, or to arb more easily stablecoins at peg.

One thing that is not supported at the moment is borrowing against agEUR as a collateral. This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the € and short the $ through agEUR.

Right now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the €. This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future.

Relative to the size of agEUR on Aave, there’s also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment.

Doing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.



## Risk Parameters

With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters.

V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon

791,"# Summary

This is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s sETH2 on AAVE.

# Motivation

Staking is foundational to the Ethereum network, with liquid staking specifically providing users with the opportunity to unlock the power of their staked capital. One of the most requested features within our protocol is the ability to utilise sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.

sETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH specifically, given the high correlation between asset prices. Following the launch of eMode within Aave V3, sETH2 would allow for leveraged ETH staking without taking on a lot of risk. Lido’s stETH has proven to be a valuable collateral asset within the Aave ecosystem and it’s time to explore adding sETH2, the second most liquid ETH staking token. This integration would benefit both StakeWise and Aave, bringing new users to both platforms.

# Specifications

**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**

I (Jordan Sutcliffe) am the BizDev Lead at StakeWise, submitting the proposal on behalf of StakeWise DAO.

**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**

->*StakeWise Overview*

StakeWise is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry, such as requiring 32 ETH and the expertise needed for maintaining staking infrastructure, allowing anyone to benefit from the rewards of the Beacon Chain.

ETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenised into sETH2, representing users’ interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2 (note this application will focus solely on sETH2).

As a liquid staking platform, users are free to un-stake at any time by trading their sETH2 back into ETH utilising the protocol’s deep liquidity pools.

Dmitri Tsumak first announced StakeWise was under development in April 2020. StakeWise launched on mainnet in March 2021, following a 9-month beta phase. StakeWise was the first staking pool to move to non-custodial staking in April 2021 and has since grown to over 70k ETH staked, helping DAOs, whales and individuals alike. In January 2022, the StakeWise Metro upgrade was announced, commencing the decentralisation of the protocol. Further information on Metro can be found [here](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8).

StakeWise has been audited by [Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits).

->*sETH2 Overview*

sETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenised staking deposit into StakeWise’s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1-to-1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts as an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH (not re-pricing or rebalancing), providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2.

sETH2 supply sits at [59,266](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a) (~$200M), held by ~3k individual users. The main liquidity pool for sETH2 is on UniSwap ([here](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)). This pool has ~$160M TVL, consisting of ~26k ETH and ~30k sETH2. StakeWise is in the process of launching a second liquidity pool on Curve, with further details provided below.

**Explain the positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**

sETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH, given the high correlation and the proven peg stability of sETH2 (detailed further below). This makes sETH2 a prime candidate for Aave’s new eMode to enable leveraged staking.

sETH2 collateral would also allow holders to take speculative positions, such as shorting an asset or taking a leveraged long position on ETH, for example.

sETH2 has deep liquidity with ~$160M TVL, soon to be spread across multiple pools.

**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**

StakeWise’s background is detailed above.

StakeWise DAO is live and manages the protocol. Whether it is changing the protocol fees, adding node operators to the network or making amendments to smart contracts, all changes require DAO approval. The StakeWise DAO is [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.

Investors in the StakeWise DAO consist of Blockdaemon, boldstart Ventures, Greenfield One, Collider Ventures, Lionschain Capital and gumi Cryptos.

The StakeWise product suite consists of liquid staking on both Ethereum and Gnosis chain, branching out into other PoS networks over time.

**How is the asset currently used?**

First and foremost, sETH2 provides holders, from individual retail stakers to DAOs, the rights to staking rewards from the Beacon Chain.

Creating utility for sETH2 is of the highest priority. Currently, sETH2 can be used to provide liquidity on AMMs, such as UniSwap and Curve. Multiple other integrations are lined up involving sETH2, such as using sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.

**Emission schedule**

There is no emission schedule. sETH2 is minted only when ETH is deposited into the StakeWise staking pool.

**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**

-> *Multi-sigs*

StakeWise has run non-custodial ETH staking since April 2021. Prior to April 2021, a multi-sig was used, named the Horcrux, with ~18k ETH of the StakeWise pool currently controlled by the Horcrux. More info can be found [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/stakewise-pool#the-horcrux).

The DAO treasury is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x144a98cb1CdBb23610501fE6108858D9B7D24934) with a DAO committee of 7 persons. The goal of the DAO committee is to monitor transactions voted upon via Snapshot and reject malicious transactions that would harm the protocol. In order to reject a transaction, a threshold of 4 out of 7 committee members must sign the rejection.

-> *Upgradable Contracts:* Yes (DAO approval only)

A successful Snapshot vote is required to make any changes to StakeWise smart contracts. The DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) and all voting rights fall to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.

**Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**

Market Cap ~$167M

Volatility -

sETH2 has proven peg stability. Superimposing stETH / ETH with sETH2 / ETH highlights this stability when compared against stETH which is already whitelisted for Aave.

![|624x205](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iV-tgDKkGvUmpr9MP6D9-qWNApCsLGrTiBqlIGL3K4IfXl2MB--glv35OerGGzZteAOZaAtbKVkCsGhGUuzgxD4JWBDpv76zk0QkfRaEMpIGAuuOuo1Ot6Ey8GF6qRC6c3JHTA60)

Note that StakeWise will soon be adjusting the main UniSwap pool by reducing the fee tier from 0.3% to 0.01%, which is expected to close the remaining gap between sETH2 and ETH. StakeWise is also in the process of launching a new pool on Curve which will further increase sETH2’s peg resilience.

# Risk Assessment

# Security Considerations

-> *Counterparty risks*

StakeWise relies on an Oracle network to accurately report daily staking rewards to the rETH2 smart contract in order to mint and distribute the correct amount of rETH2. Currently, there are 5 oracles live with details provided [here](https://launchpad.eatsteakbewise.com/oraclestatus-mainnet.html). Note that the number of oracles on the network will be increasing from 5 to 10 over the coming months.

4 out of the 5 oracles are required to submit the same rewards data for the total supply of rETH2 is updated. Further information is found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/oracle/blob/master/README.md).

As previously detailed, the protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO. Extra security features are in place to stop malicious transactions from passing through the DAO. For example, each successful on-chain proposal must undergo two days of escalation game, before entering one day of the multi-sig backstop period.

-> *Staking risks*

sETH2 holders are exposed to risks associated with staking, such as slashing events and downtime penalties. The StakeWise DAO has taken steps to mitigate these risks:

* Prospective node operators are vetted by the validator committee, required to enter a testnet and must pass situational stress testing. Only then will the StakeWise DAO vote for whether an operator can join the network. StakeWise only on-boards leading node operators to ensure the highest security and yield for its users.
* StakeWise provides node operators with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, such as the ability to quickly transition between staking clients on demand.
* There is no staking insurance currently in place, however we are working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance as a high priority (expected to be in place by early May).

Note that hostage risks are common in liquid staking pools, however this does not apply to StakeWise. The StakeWise DAO controls the exit signatures for its operators, allowing the DAO to force exit validators from the network should the situation arise. This makes it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage and will ensure that all future staking rewards, such as MEV and tips, flow to the pool.

StakeWise has experienced no slashing or downtime penalties to date.

-> *Smart Contract Risks*

Stakers are exposed to smart contract risk. To mitigate this, the protocol has undergone audits by 3 separate auditors: Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)). Our code is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts).

Despite having no security concerns to date, StakeWise is committed to reducing the risk for its users and is in the process of adding a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI.

-> *Price Oracles*

sETH2 currently relies on a UniSwap TWAP oracle. With the addition of new liquidity pools, we will be upgrading our oracle to a Chainlink oracle over the coming months.

# Proposed Risk Parameters

* LTV: 70% (vs 82.5% for ETH)
* Liquidation Threshold: 75% (vs 85% for ETH)
* Liquidation Bonus: 7.5% (vs 5% for ETH)
* Reserve Factor: 10% (vs 10% for ETH)

The proposed sETH2 risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH. ETH and sETH2 are highly correlated, and as such, have similar volatility profiles. The LTV and liquidity threshold below that of ETH account for the extra risks associated with liquidating sETH2.

797,"#### Upgrade of Meta Apes’ Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift Meta Apes’ Farm rewards from the current PEEL-BUSD v2 LP to the new PEEL-BUSD v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the PEEL-BUSD v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the PEEL token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current PEEL price.)

To ensure a smooth transition between v2 and v3 pairs, there will be an overlap of one day where there will be incentives directed towards both farms. This will occur on 4 May 2023. 

After **0730 UTC on 4 May 2023**, only the v3 pair will receive incentives, so users are encouraged to migrate in advance of this time.

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new Farm will have doubled emissions for the first 7 days. For example, if the v2 farm emits 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will emit 20 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 10 CAKE per day thereafter.

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake PEEL-**BUSD** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.2x multiplier
- **9 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.25% fee tier):
- Stake PEEL-**BUSD** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.5x multiplier (1x multiplier for the first 7 days)
- 18 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and **9 CAKE per day** thereafter 

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 0.5x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

A proposal to gradually wind down the CRV market on Aave V2 Ethereum via a series of LT reductions.

## Motivation

In light of the ongoing **[discussions](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644/31)** concerning the CRV market on v2 Ethereum and further propelled by the debates and developments following the **[Vyper Exploit](https://governance.aave.com/t/post-vyper-exploit-crv-market-update-and-recommendations/14214)**, our recommendation remains to deprecate the CRV market on V2 by implementing a series of LT reductions.
We have previously proposed and executed the following reductions:

1. [[ARC] - Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum - LTs and LTVs for Long Tail Assets (2022.12.04)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lts-and-ltvs-for-long-tail-assets-2022-12-04/10926)
2. [[ARFC] - Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - CRV Aave V2 Ethereum - 2023.06.15](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-crv-aave-v2-ethereum-2023-06-15/13709)
3. [[ARFC] - Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - CRV Aave V2 Ethereum - 2023.07.10](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-crv-aave-v2-ethereum-2023-07-10/13952) - execution was canceled due to CRV price volatility. **Given the current market conditions, we plan to resubmit this proposal shortly by AIP.**

While we advocate for proactive offboarding of the market, our recommendation is that the DAO risk managers deliver a bi-weekly analysis and recommendation for each individual LT reduction. This would be similar to the process of increasing supply caps. if the risk managers agree on a single recommendation, the proposal would move directly to an AIP, but in case of disagreement, the more conservative approach would be adopted, with the alternative proposal put to a Snapshot vote for the community to decide.

### Plan:

Following is our recommended bi-weekly plan for communications and community transparency of the process:

- **Monday** - Risk teams conduct independent analyses and recommendations, considering (but not limited to) the following:
    1. Impact of the LT reduction on user positions - number of accounts and total amounts eligible for liquidation post-LT update
    2. Impact of the LT reduction on the health factor of the top accounts
    3. On-chain liquidity 
- **Tuesday** -  Gauntlet and Chaos Labs post a joint recommendation post after syncing on their analyses above
- **Wednesday** - AIP posted
    - If risk teams are not aligned on a single recommendation, a Snapshot vote will be posted to gauge community preference

800,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust six (6) total risk parameters including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. In addition, Gauntlet recommends freezing legacy KNC. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

## Specification


Our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. 

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| DAI Loan To Value     | 75%     | 77%     |
| LINK Liquidation Bonus     | 6.5%     | 6.3%     |
| LINK Liquidation Threshold    | 75%     | 78%     |
| USDC Loan To Value    | 82.5%     | 85.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Bonus    | 4.0%     | 4.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Threshold    | 85%     | 86%     |



See below volatility and exchange volume data from 03/17 to 03/31. These are useful metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. 

|Symbol| 03-31 Volatility| 03-17 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| DAI   | 	0.180079852     |  0.18048045   | 	-0.000400598   | 2.9325893   |
| LINK    |  0.77471859    |  1.054943327   | 	-0.280224737    | 26.950699 |
| USDC    |  0.029199586    |  0.031859885    | -0.002660299   |  3.1429237  |





## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. 

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

## Freezing Legacy KNC

The KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20/2021, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 3/28/2022, roughly 195M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdefa4e8a7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 57M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There are currently $2.9M KNCL supplied and $900K total borrowed on Aave v2.

Considering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.



## Next Steps
* Targeting an AIP on 2022-04-05",bullish
801,"This proposal has two principles to empower Ultrasound CAKE.


1. Increase the MAX CAPS (proposed weight gauges) for the CAKE pool from 35% to 60%.


Pros - This will undoubtedly encourage more CAKE staking, consequently strengthening the entire community and reducing selling pressure.


2. Develop a new aggressive reduction plan (around 50%) of emissions to take place over the next 4 months.


Pros - It is crucial to signal greater scarcity of CAKE to the market. All holders stand to gain from this measure. And this could happen until the BTC halving to take advantage of the bull run - THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TIMING.


Cons - This two proposals may decrease CAKE reward in farms. However, perform an analysis. There are two types of suppliers:


1. The holder
2. Those who sell CAKE to increase their APR farm.


The holder will not be bothered by these measures as they will benefit from them. However, those who sell CAKE will have two alternatives. Either they will start to become holders, which is beneficial for the community, or they will lose some selling CAKE rewards. But okay, they can continue selling, as the selling pressure will decrease significantly, and soon they will realize that selling CAKE is a bad deal.


I have been with CAKE since day 1. I saw CAKE go from $0.29 to 13, then 22, and reaching 44. 


Today, the protocol built by the devs, who deserve ENORMOUS RESPECT AND CONGRATULATIONS FROM THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY for their work, is much better than when it reached above 40. So, we need to instill more confidence to holde CAKE and to reduce the constant ""every day selling"" from farm´s by those who are only interested in increasing APR. Even these individuals should benefit because with a higher CAKE price, the supplier's CAKE reward will be greater.


Devs... it´s all about CAKE!! Let's empower Ultrasound CAKE with more deflation.",bullish

title: ARC: Avalanche Market - AVAX Risk Parameters Update
status: WIP
author: @MatthewGraham from Index Coop and @ChrisG from Defi Pulse
created: 28-01-2022
---

# Simple Summary
We propose adjusting two (2) AVAX risk parameters on the Aave Avalanche Market: LTV and Liquidation Threshold.

# Abstract
This proposal updates two AVAX risk parameters on the Aave Avalanche Market to align with the Moderate risk level chosen by the Aave community. Index Coop has compiled the following analysis for Gauntlet and the broader Aave community to review.

# Motivation
Updating the AVAX parameters seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

# Specification
The criteria for assessing market risk, as determined by the market size and changes in fluctuation in demand, is presented by the Aave community here. In line with the criteria, analysis of the AVAX token on Avalanche network is presented below (data as of Jan. 23, 2021):

AVAX Avalanch Market Risk (Coingecko Data)

|Holders:|1.8 m|A|B+|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Transactions (C-chain)|79 m|B+|
|Mkt Cap|$15 bn|A+|
|Avg. Volume 1m|$860 m|B+|
|Avg. Volume 3m|$1.14 bn|B+|
|Norm. Volatility|6.21%|B-|

The AVAX token risk score compiled by Index Coop is B+.

Holders are estimated by the cumulative address count.

Market Cap is calculated using circulating supply.

The Norm. volatility parameter is the average of the t=30 days and t=90 days as shown in the below table.

AVAX Volatility Data (Coingecko Data)

|Time|S.D. of daily log returns|
| --- | --- |
|t=7 days|6.21%|
|t=30 days|5.54%|
|t= 90 days|6.88%|
|t= 180 days|7.80%|
|t= 365 days|8.81%|

Based upon the volatility data share above, Index Coop suggests changing the Liquidation Threshold and Loan to Value parameters as shown below:


|Parameter|Current Value|Recommended Value|
| --- | --- | --- |
|AVAX Loan to Value|50%|60%|
|AVAX Liquidation Threshold|65%|70%|

# Implementation
We are actively seeking feedback on how to implement this proposal. At this point in time an AIP vote could signal community intent/desire to change the requirements with the changes to be made by the guardians of the Aave Avalanche Market or via the AIP if a permissionless process is in place by that point in time.

804,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal, entitled the “Exploring New Frontiers: Bring ApeCoin ($Ape) into the Mobile Gaming World,” also known as AIP-xxx brings the utilities and values of ApeCoin to thousands of new holders through its integration into the Meta Merge game – a pet collection and mobile evolution game powered by AIGC and Ultiverse.

By integrating ApeCoin into the game, $Ape becomes another in-game asset in Meta Merge for new holders and game players to enjoy gamified experiences based on real-world utility. We aim to reinforce and leverage ApeCoin and its ecosystem by creating new user experiences through the power of the game. Thus, this integration will provide an ecosystem where players can utilize APE tokens within the game, alongside the other benefits they know APE tokens for.

#### OVERALL COST

NO funds are needed from ApeCoin DAO. Meta Merge will be responsible for the cost of smart contract deployment, testing and auditing, and other fees and resources associated with AIP-xxx. We request support from the ApeCoin Community for implementing this integration and will be responsible for updating all progress.

806,"As there has been renewed interest for buy and burn and the original discussion didn't allow for a choice between the two (governance participants had made a choice for distribution to veCRV holders), community members have asked us to resubmit those two options for a signalling vote.

**Important to note, the outcome of this signalling tool does not change the implementation of the admin fee (and its current vote https://dao.curve.fi/vote/parameter/2 ) , only how it will be distributed.**

**In light of recent manipulation in two different discourse polls (gold + buy and burn vs veCRV distribution), it's worth nothing discourse polls will not be considered anymore going forward.**

Read more and discuss: https://gov.curve.fi/t/cip-14-buy-and-burn-vs-distribution-to-vecrv-holders/759

Options:

1. **Buy and burn**  - Buy and burn would currently destroy around 5% (1.75% of daily circulation inflow) of the daily CRV inflation.

2. **veCRV holders Distribution** - Current locked supply is around 10% which could result in APY of over 250% meaning rough calculations suggest distribution to veCRV holders will likely remove selling pressure more effectively as people vote lock for their boost and receive fees. Seeing the total vote locked double from 10% to 20% seems realistic which would remove over 10% of the daily inflation against 1.75% for the buy and burn option.",bearish

815,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z  The Happy Ape, an official MBA #00349, is a premium brand that aims to foster a culture of kindness, compassion and positive mental health in our future generations. This AIP would directly fund the creation of The Happy Ape children’s book and plush, nfc tags, and dapp development on ApeChain creating a unique digi-physical web3 experience for both kids and adults. I believe in the future of ApeCoin and am proudly offering a 20% gross revenue back to the dao based on the initial products sold. With the development of AIP-378 I will use ApeChain and $Ape to create innovative solutions, and integrate them into the products. Bored Labs, LLC. will take on the majority of work that is required, reducing costs needed from the dao and includes but is not limited to, e-commerce site creation [thehappyape.io](thehappyape.io), add $Ape as an accepted payment for our products, develop the majority of ApeChain dapp work, and nfc configuration. All development will be open source and will be fully audited, ideally by boring security dao or in cooperation with Horizen Labs. (edited)

What makes any of this special? Our children’s book will be one of the very first web3 books that can not only teach children and parents about the power of the blockchain, but also onboard them as well using ApeChain. The book is fully written and authored by myself. Here is a quick summary of the book below, or skip it for the juicy tech.

![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/4/4fa2a982de08cd201b68bfb210630005b085a7f8_2_500x500.jpeg)

“The Happy Ape and his friend journey on a daily adventure, gathering bananas amidst the vibrant jungle. Their routine centers around a central tree housing a precious book where their banana counts are meticulously tallied and stored. When theft of the only book shatters their dreams, The Happy Ape crafts a magical book, uniting the jungle’s apes in trust. With every ape receiving a copy of the newfound magical book, no one could lie, steal or cheat because all books have to agree. All of the ape’s lives changed for the better, The Happy Ape and his friend finally could purchase the coveted bouncy ball, playing happily ever after together.”

Such an amazing story isn’t it, how can it get any better? I plan on integrating an nfc tag into every book. Thus delivering a digi-physical experience allowing the user to scan the tag with a compatible mobile device and instantly mint a digital version of their book. This will be a seamless cost free user interaction all powered by our ApeChain (kudos Horizen Labs). In order to do all of this I plan on partnering with IYK, a premier supplier of nfc tags in the web3 space. Their mobile app will allow easy access to our digi-physical experience. This requires the development of smart contracts and a dapp on ApeChain. The development will be achieved through Bored Labs, LLC., and will be open source. I believe that open source development leads to better community adoption, security, and transparency. I have many plans for the evolution of our digi-physical experience as well. IYK allows for OTA updates, easy updates to modules introducing the user to new features like unique stories, animations and more. In addition to this experience I will also have an e-commerce site with the ability to purchase the products with $Ape.

To ensure an unforgettable and joyful experience, I have designed with meticulous attention to detail, a special Happy Ape plush, ensuring they become cherished friends for all. This plush will be approximately 15’’ in length and 6’’ wide. Many plushies are small and not even comfy. Our design ensures a warm, soft, and comfy embrace. The Happy Ape is sure to be a loving companion for so many around the world.

![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/0/04f1f686c4ab2b5611831c4589006f0963fce7cc_2_462x1000.png)

Digitizing Items
* Permanently link a 1:1 NFT to a physical Item (shown above irl test)
* Independently deploy Chips without any knowledge of code
* Schedule campaigns according to specific groups of Items
* Configure your digital experience using IYK Modules

So…“Who are you entrusting valuable DAO funds to, you may wonder, and what qualifies me for it?”

Let me start off by introducing myself. My name is Kevin, I’m 37 and I’m married with 3 kids. 8 yo girl, 6 yo boy, 2 yo girl. I’m a software architect and I’ve been in the web3 space for a few years. I have run a successful software company, Bored Labs, LLC., for 3 years now. I have bookshelves full of children’s books and bags full of plushies. The amount of time I’ve spent reading to my kids and playing with plushies is measured in years! I believe in the power of community and helping others which is why I am here. My passion to share kindness and love back into the world while helping others is what motivates me to do this. I want to provide value back to the various communities connected to apecoin and help them grow as well. I hope that through future collaborations I can work with other communities like bulls on the block and mocaverse to continue creating positive and inspirational children’s books along with animated videos. I believe this is a small stepping stone that will lead to a much larger goal of combining web3 ip use to bring people together.

I added a budget for marketing that will help ensure reach and the success of my brand. Half of the marketing budget will be given back to the buyers of my products. A simple marketing strategy i’ll rely on will be asking product buyers to post images of themselves with my products and reward them with $APE. The other half will be reserved for various marketing efforts as needed.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
 Most importantly ApeCoin DAO will be supporting and empowering our future generations through a unique onboarding digi-physical experience that will help amplify innovative solutions on ApeChain. This AIP will help promote the use and growth of ApeChain and $APE by building one of the first dapps that will help onboard many new users and introduce them to ApeCoin. The Happy Ape products aim to give more visibility to the ApeCoin community in a positive light. We will also be reaching a new audience that we haven’t explored much of. Our products support kindness, compassion, and positive mental health which is something we could all use more of.

We’re offering 20% gross revenue back to the DAO to show gratitude and continued support back to the community. (Detailed under our Overall Cost)

As a result of this proposal, IYK has promised that they would add ApeChain as a supported chain to their application.

This would allow anyone using IYK to use ApeChain as their selected chain to mint nfts on. It would help guide the development and use of digi-physical experiences on ApeChain, and directly fund code that is open source leading to better security and adoption starting within our community. We need a better way for fast adoption of ApeCoin.

I will ensure resources like artists/animators are from the ApeCoin community. With many more future books and animated videos I plan to collaborate with more ApeCoin communities. I promise to innovate new ways of incorporating ApeChain and $Ape into our future products as this is just a stepping stone for us. It’s important that we continue development around ApeChain and $APE. I would be honored to have ApeCoin DAO help us cultivate positivity into many lives of our next generation around the world.

But all good things come to an end. Now I'm in the hospital, I have a lot of unpaid bills and a hacked wallet with my tokens.

At first I thought I would just sell my steaking to an acquaintance for 50% of the value to cover my loans. But we discovered that my wallet had been hacked. Since I am a developer and have a lot of experience in WEB3 I realize that I can bypass the sweeper.

There are several solutions:

1. We will reach the management of pancake, they will allow me to withdraw earlier, even if at 100% loss of rewards

2. Users who can help - donate funds to me, and I extend steaking for a year and give the private wallet key to you

Gauge Proposal Template:

**Summary:**
> This proposal enables a Balancer gauge for a R/sDAI boosted pool on Ethereum Mainnet. By deploying this new pool, users will be able to borrow $R stablecoin on the Raft protocol and provide liquidity on a R/sDAI boosted stable pool without giving up the whole 3.49% DSR (DAI Savings Rate) accrued on DAI deposited in the DSR module. The deployment of this pool embraces the ongoing expansion of $sDAI, the yield-bearing version of DAI, and eliminates the opportunity cost that current LPs in DAI pools face. A future integration of sDAI as a collateral token in Raft could further strengthen the utilization of such a pool, allowing users to use sDAI to leverage up.

· GitHub: [Raft · GitHub](https://github.com/raft-fi/)

**Protocol Description:**

> Raft is a DeFi protocol that lets you generate $R by depositing liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) as collateral. R is a decentralized USD stablecoin with deep liquidity across many trading pairs and a stable peg. Raft provides a capital-efficient way to borrow while keeping your staking rewards. As more use cases for $R develop, users will be able to spend, swap, and earn with $R. Users will also be able to leverage up to 6x on different LSD tokens in a single atomic transaction.
 

**Motivation:**

> The R/sDAI boosted pool on Balancer represents the natural evolution of the current R/DAI pool and will allow all Raft users to swap their borrowed $R into $sDAI (or any other asset via multi-step swaps). Users holding $sDAI can earn the DSR yield accrued on the underlying DAI deposited in the DSR module and then use all money markets, DEXs, liquidity pools and vaults, NFT marketplaces, and all other products, on every chain where $sDAI can be bridged.  


**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** The Raft protocol is governance-minimized. This means nobody controls any key part or mechanism affecting the core protocol functionality. There is no way to pause the smart contracts. The Raft team only has the ability to adjust fees

2. **Oracles:** The pool relies on price feeds from Chainlink and Tellor

3. **Audits:** Raft is audited by Trail of Bits and Hats Finance
- [ Trail of Bits audit - May 2023](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-04-tempus-raft-securityreview.pdf)

- [ Hats Finance audit competition - May 2023](https://twitter.com/hatsfinance/status/1659263484641660928)

4. **Centralization vectors:** 
- Liquidations are permissionless (anybody can liquidate)
- The key parts of Raft protocol are immutable
- [Liquidity Committee](https://docs.raft.fi/about-r/soft-peg/liquidity-committee) 3 Raft team members. More to be added in the future as the Raft governance evolves

5. **Market History:** Raft was launched on June 5th 2023, and has attracted approx $53m TVL. The Raft team has worked with the Balancer community to launch two successful pools (see $R here, the R/DAI pool on Balancer[ here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x20a61b948e33879ce7f23e535cc7baa3bc66c5a9000000000000000000000555) and $sDAI[ here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x83f20f44975d03b1b09e64809b757c47f942beea)) we would like to continue being a proponent of Balancer going forward.
 
6. **Value:** The R/DAI pool deployed on Balancer has been among the top 3 pools on Balancer by trading volume in the last few weeks, gathering $ 42 mln TVL in less than a month. We expect the R/sDAI pool to generate an even higher volume due to the enhanced capital efficiency of holding $sDAI instead of $DAI, which will benefit all LPs and users of Raft.

#### PancakeSwap Welcomes Froyo Games ($FROYO) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a Syrup Pool with Froyo Games, a decentralized game publisher offering a complete platform for blockchain games.

Froyo Games returns to the Syrup Pool with more rewards — this time with a FROYO-CAKE farm!


#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $FROYO tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 5,883,000 FROYO
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on March 25th 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on May 24th 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 3.404 FROYO 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the $FROYO Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a FROYO-CAKE farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the farm period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.

#### What is $FROYO?

From the team: “FROYO is the native token of the Froyo Games platform and the primary medium of transaction across all of its offerings, including but not limited to the Froyo NFT Marketplace and inside of the various Play-to-Earn games coming to the platform. Its supply is limited to 1,000,000,000 FROYO with no contract function to mint or burn any additional tokens. 

FROYO will also be used to purchase tickets on the Froyo Gamebox to enter into competitive mini-games with real prizes. In the future, $FROYO tokens can also be staked via the $veFROYO mechanism to earn more $FROYO tokens collected from fees and revenue of platform services, tokens from upcoming game releases and NFT airdrops for new games coming to the platform.”

823,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across five (5) Aave V2 assets. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

## Specification

Our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels.

======

RPL appears to be a coin with a purpose and a real use case.
The $26,465,785 70 RPL - 30 WETH pool is one of the biggest on Balancer and earns BAL at a rate of $10m worth of BAL/year.

Unfortunately it generates very little volume with 24h volumes oscilating in low tens of thousands of USD, last 24h volume: $30,891

A $2m pool would be enough to facilitate low slippage trading for such volumes so I propose reducing the BAL rewards cap to reduce from 10m *to 3m*. I think that the $10m yearly worth of rewards could be used to encourage other, more useful liquidity.

On top of the low trading volumes and low interest from traders, my subjective opinion is that the valuation is artificially inflated, I’m not happy about heavy concentration of this pool in hands of a single liquidity provider (90% single LP, recently >97%). CMC shows that this coin trades >$900k on Bilaxy and >300k on LBank within 24h which I find hard to believe. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rocket-pool/markets",bullish

# Proposal:

Approve a “dry powder” allocation of up to $2MM BAL for Tokemak bribe acquisition in connection with BLABS biz dev efforts to grow integrations with Tokemak

## What is Tokemak?

Tokemak can be thought of as a generalized liquidity layer that sits above DEXEs. Users can both LP and direct where the liquidity will go via TOKE voting.

Tokemak has two types of reactors - reactors can just be thought of as a place users can single side stake their assets to earn yield, then the assets are directed via TOKE voters to determine its pair(s). There are pair reactors, those can be thought of as the assets that are generally paired with protocol tokens - being ETH/USDC/DAI/FEI/etc. Then there's the token reactors, which are voted on and added during a ""CoRE'' vote - namely SUSHI/FOX/FXS/etc.

Up to this point TOKE has been distributed via LM incentives for their toke/eth pairs on Uni and Sushi. As well as from staking TOKE to reactors to incentivize Liquidity Direction (and some token swaps).

The ideal future state for Tokemak is most if not all TOKE is being vied for by AMMs/other protocols to direct liquidity towards their token or platform while Tokemak controls a large bag of protocol owned assets that are earning fees and being utilized to stand up other protocols liquidity.

## Summary

Tokemak currently provides options for four different DEXes users can direct their liquidity - Uniswap, Sushiswap, Curve and Balancer. Of the four, Balancer is by far the lowest performing. For reference:

* FXS Reactor
  * $514k/$175.2MM directed towards Balancer (0.29%)
* ALCX Reactor
  * $709.80/$32.1MM directed towards Balancer (0.002%)
* FOX Reactor
  * $0/$22.2MM directed towards Balancer (0%)

As of writing this proposal Tokemak controls $905MM worth of assets that TOKE holders are directing to the above mentioned DEXEs. Balancer is currently commanding less than $1MM of that.

Every 5-6 months a new CoRE vote goes live to determine the next round of projects that will launch their own reactors. As of writing this piece this is by far the lowest cost barrier to entry for a CoRE vote to date. The last CoRE vote reached a peak of ~$0.75/vote, [while the highest bribe on Hidden Hand is commanding just ~$0.07/vote](https://hiddenhand.finance/tokemak).

Reactors provide several benefits, namely those being

* Ability to stake a protocol’s assets to farm TOKE, which can then be staked to direct liquidity to Balancer.
* Opens the doors for a token swap with Tokemak to allow Balancer to kickstart Liquidity Directing, currently the best deal on this is FXS where one TOKE can direct up to $114 of FXS
* Makes all future partnerships and integrations infinitely easier due to the Balancer community showing some support for Tokemak
* Pending the launch of the reactor, the reactor could potentially be prewired to deploy to gauges to veBAL and further incentivize a TOKE/ETH 80/20 pool (Liquidity is deployed in cycles). Attracting further liquidity for TOKE/ETH providers away from Sushi/Uni.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

The below Cost-Benefit Analysis assumes 10% TVL utilization at 30 bps and a $4MM token swap is performed with Tokemak. This does not include if any BAL was staked in the Balancer Reactor. The top row shows different scenarios based on a WACC varying from 10%-20% for BAL. As can be seen from the Net Cost Benefit section, this would result in a positive $1.46MM-$1.66M benefit to Balancer, as well as $35.26MM in TVL captured.

||10%|15%|20%|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Bribe Cost|$2.2MM|$2.3MM|$2.4MM|
|Swap Amount|$4MM|$4MM|$4MM|
|TVL Captured|$35.26MM|$35.26MM|$35.26MM|
|Annualized Fee Revenue|$3.86MM|$3.86MM|$3.86MM|
|Net Cost Benefit|$1.66MM|$1.56MM|$1.46MM|

**TVL captured is found by utilizing the info in the FXS reactor, where 1 TOKE = $114 of liquidity available to be directed. 1 Toke = ~$13*

It is also worth noting that TOKE has shown only a 0.14 correlation with ETH while BAL has shown a 0.50 correlation with ETH.[*](https://cryptowat.ch/correlations) This effectively acts as a way for the Balancer Treasury to diversify out of assets directly correlated with ETH while simultaneously providing the benefits listed above.

# Plan of Action

## Tiered Bribe Deployment

The average cost for one TOKE via bribing last CoRE vote was ~$0.75, each TOKE equals six votes. To qualify for a Reactor last CoRE vote, 12 million votes were required. As of writing this proposal only one protocol has deployed any bribes and that is LUNA, who have deployed ~$257K worth of bribes and accrued ~4.4MM votes. This is far less than $0.75/TOKE.

What we propose is instead to send out tiered bribe amounts, starting at $0.35/TOKE and scaling to $1/TOKE utilizing $2MM of BAL to bribe with.

## Reactor Farming + Potential Token Swap + Biz Dev Efforts

As illustrated in the above Cost-Benefit analysis, securing the BAL reactor + token swap would lead to a net gain in all scenarios plus the additional benefit of TVL captured.

We propose that after the bribing period Balancer engages in a Token Swap with Tokemak to seed the initial reactor and allow for Balancer to start directing TVL to it’s platform. Currently the best deal is FXS, however we can deliberate on that post CoRE vote.

This is also part of a holistic discussion that the biz dev team is working on with Tokemak, which includes:

1. Developing default 80/20 pools for deployment on each reactor, which will help differentiate Balancer from other DEXs + raise awareness on their benefits for LPs
2. Working with Tokemak to explore veBAL program as an alt to veCRV on Toke/WETH
3. Discussing boosted pools and stable pools as an option for their exchange assets to increase capital efficiency when retained in the PCV account
4. Balancer reactor as a means to acquire TOKE for Balancer as an LD

BLABS Biz Dev believes that Balancer is in a unique position to compete with LDs globally on Tokemak to acquire TVL for our long term growth. The CBA proves that under conservative assumptions. Tokemak is heavily interested in this as well (for their growth), but finds it even more interesting if it helps bootstrap the flywheel for their involvement in veBAL. There are a number of synergies to be had here with both assets serving as productive for Tokeamk and Balancer.

## Targeted veBAL Education

As a way to dissuade Hidden Hand users from instantly dumping the BAL, run an educational campaign on the value of veBAL. This could come in the form of an AMA with the Tokemak/Redacted communities and/or targeted Twitter Threads.

# Risks

* Bribe is insufficient and BAL used is lost, this is highly unlikely considering the current bribe market and protocols involved. For additional context all Tokemak voters are highly aware of Hidden Hand and utilize it to auto deploy their votes. Most voters have not delegated as they are waiting to see how much will be deployed to Hidden Hand.
* Smart contract risk - Hidden Hand exploited during the bribe period, Tokemak exploited. However this is also highly unlikely and is a necessary risk when deploying funds anywhere in DeFi.
* Risk can also be mitigated by purchasing Insurance cover via InsurAce (https://app.insurace.io/Insurance/BuyCovers)
* Both projects have been audited multiple times ([Tokemak Audits](https://docs.tokemak.xyz/protocol-information/network-security), [Hidden Hand Audits](https://redacted-cartel.gitbook.io/redacted/additional-materials/security-measures))

#### OVERALL COST

The total cost of this proposal is $ 114,129 USD for a 3 month term.

Please note: ApeComms is not taking custody of the total budget up front or in full. Contributors would be compensated directly by the Ape Foundation on a monthly basis. ApeComms Operating Fund amounts would only be accessed as needed. Breakdown of compensation vs operating fund is available below.

We have been advised by the administrators during our previous AIP submission that we should provide an exact day each month to receive compensation. For our purposes, the first day of every month would be ideal to receive team compensation. For the ApeComms Operating Fund, for which we will submit invoices to be paid by the Ape Foundation, we kindly request those be paid as needed. We were also advised by the administrators to request an amount in USD, which is why we have done so.

So if pancakeswap has DOTC, it will let China People smoothen their trading and for future it can be increase the trading volume incredibly in PanCakeswap.

837,"Cake has been suffering towards a downward price action spiral which causes significant stress and pain to the community, the real cause for this is the inflationary state of $CAKE.

After the V3 launch the Farms APR and Emissions started to look more realistic in APR wise, the team is making a proposal to reduce emissions to Farms to improve towards achieve Ultrasound Cake, still if this proposal succeed we will achieve a 2% extra of the goal reaching 71% status.

The current emission model assign 191.557 CAKE daily towards Staking with an APR to Locked Staking of ~41.3% and a Flexible APR of ~1.93% and different APR for the different token partnership pools.

More CAKE doesn't mean more money, it's the balance towards emission/burn which will guarantee our success.

This proposal goes toward split half of the emissions that goes to Staking and redirect them to a Dynamic Reward pool system

The new emission example would be ~95.778,5 CAKE to Staking, ~95.778,5 CAKE to Dynamic Reward pool. 

How does the Dynamic Reward Pool (DRP) system would work?
It will be a system based on CAKE/platform usage, the more CAKE get used the more we will redirect back to the locked stakers, the rest not used will go towards burn in a weekly basis.
That would mean that in bull market the locked staking users will receive a huge boost based on the usage of the platform and in bear market it will be less improving the capital flow system and the sustainability of the price in the long-term avoiding the downtrend spiral for the project.

The Final APR would look like:

Flexible staking APR ~0.965%",neutral

842,"The M-Token team proposes adding a [MBTC, [sBTC pool]] Metapool. Adding a MBTC pool will further increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum and make it easier to swap between assets.

Hello everyone,

We are M-Token team. Today, we would like to introduce M-Tokens, and initiate the proposal to add the MBTC Metapool on the Curve platform.
First of all, MBTC is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum issued by M-Tokens on a 1:1 basis peg to actual Bitcoin. This enables seamless integration of crypto assets on other blockchains into the Ethereum ecosystem and brings the community another choice to enjoy the cross-chain transaction with convenience, transparency, and value.

All M-Tokens reserves are safeguarded by qualified custodians. At the current stage, M-Token is supported by Cactus Custody, who manages private keys in the industry high-level HSMs and its proprietary multi-tiered storage system by the tier-4 grade data centers across three continents. Its segregation of duty and zero-trust system design can guarantee the safety and availability of the assets without dependency on any single individual. Meanwhile, a multi-signature mechanism is adopted by M-Tokens for its crucial aspects such as mining and burning, allowing on-the-chain verification. Thus, it provides cross-chain asset services that are both transparent and reliable. Major parties taking part in M-Tokens include the governing bodies, custodians, merchants, and the end users.

In terms of technical aspects, smart contact and hash mapping are adopted. Simultaneously, the reserve deposit addresses, outstanding balances, and transaction records are made 100% public and traceable to enable exact cross-chain mapping. In terms of governance, checks and balances are achieved through a multi-institutional framework, roles/rights segregation, and decentralization, facilitating the prevention of malice committed by any individual or entity. Moreover, the blacklisting mechanism lays a foundation for ongoing governance and regulatory compliance.

M-Token has currently collaborated with SynFutures protocol, where its users can use MBTC to trade the derivatives product on the platform. M-Token has also partnered with Matrixport on industry-leading crypto financial solutions, which will empower M-Token with the capacity of yield generating in the future. Most importantly, the capability to conduct structural products and become a gateway between DeFi and CeFi will be the parts we focus on, and it definitely is our unique advantage.

We believe that adding the MBTC pool will increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum, and enable the BTC holders invest their assets into Ethereum projects in a convenient, speedy and cost-effective manner.

Audits Security Reviews:
M-Tokens & MBTC has been audited by Peckshield. 

MBTC Market Cap: [Will be updated]
Currently, MBTC total supply is “200”.

850,"##### ABSTRACT
Ape Express aims to launch the ultimate toolkit for a thriving memecoin ecosystem on ApeChain, empowering users with the tools they need to create, customize and deploy tokens on ApeChain.

With Ape Express no technical skills are needed for safe, unruggable launches. Configure and deploy your token with multiple features in seconds.

Streamlined liquidity management: borrow, deploy, and lock liquidity effortlessly. Developers can deploy an LP using borrowed capital, and launch a coin with a starting market cap of $15K while spending only $300 out of pocket. 
Liquidity loans can be automatically repaid from token taxes, liquidity, or manual payment.

In one place users can create their brand identity, deploy tokens, manage liquidity, build and engage their community. (Think Pump.fun on ApeChain, but way better and less trash. For instance, on Pump.fun tokens start with 1K MC, and never have a chance to reach a DEX. With our system, every launch makes it to the DEX of choice and encourages a free open market on ApeChain.)

Token creators will have an option and be encouraged to airdrop portion of their supply to the holders of the blue chip collections of Yuga ecosystem. BAYC/MAYC/BAKC, CryptoPunks, Kodas, Moonbirds and Mocaverse holders.

This will bring benefit to the holders of these collections and, at the same time, give the upcoming projects an opportunity to reach the high quality user bases that are the lifeblood of these collections.

All of these processes are streamlined in the dapp so that anyone can do it with a few clicks of a button.

This project aims to expand the ApeCoin ecosystem, increase token velocity, TVL and offer new opportunities for the builders in the ApeChain ecosystem.

None of the funds requested in this proposal will be spent on development or team salary. This proposal aims to bootstrap platform liquidity and the Ape Express marketing budget.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
1. Ape Express will give 10% of all gross revenue from platform fees back to the Apecoin DAO’s treasury.
2. Onboarding memecoin degens from other chains and converting this liquidity into $APE.
3. Boosting APE liquidity pairs: Ape Express encourages users to pair their tokens with $APE by automatically converting ETH, USDT, and other assets used on the platform into $APE. By locking APE in LPs we contribute to the overall TVL of the ApeChain.
4. Amplifying on-chain activity: by facilitating fast and easy token creation and trading of memecoins, we drive overall transactions volume. Memecoin trading volume on Solana accounts for $1.2B daily, and over $120M in volume on Base chain. We drive transaction volume to the ApeChain native DEX.
5. Enhancing APE token velocity: gas fees, liquidity loans, and buybacks will all utilize $APE.
6. Backed by The Crypto is a Fun marketing engine. The apes you see above are some of the most prolific memecoin degens in web3. We have our fingers on the pulse of the space and can push our audience over to ApeChain. We run the #1 daily memecoin spaces on CT best believe we will promote ApeChain and Ape Express to the masses.
7. With our novel liquidity loan system we will attract aspiring devs because of the low barrier to entry. They don’t need initial liquidity - they just need a dream and that dog in em

LIST of FEATURES:
1. Token creation
2. Liquidity loans (initial LP)
3. Option to airdrop portion of supply to BAYC/MAYC or other Yuga NFTs.
4. Telegram trading bot - web-facing interface
5. Liquidity lockers
6. Airdrop multi sender
7. Stake APE to earn platform-generated revenue
8. Competitive leaderboard for hot pairs and contest
9. Degen Analytic bots
10. AI Website & brand builder

PLATFORMS & TECHNOLOGIES:
* Smart contracts for deploying tokens
* Smart contracts for lending liquidity & liquidity locker built-in
* Smart contracts and mechanisms for clawing back lent out liquidity

We have created our own set of contracts which interact with each other, giving as much fluidity and flexibility to the system as possible. Users simply pay for token minting, which is dependent on how many features they are including in the token. This acts as initial revenue for the product to safeguard minor expenses with regard to the deploying costs(the user’s token and other related contracts per product deployed), and liquidity rounding errors from the lending activities.

There are several ways for users to repay the loans:
* Direct payment: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, repay a direct 12,500 APE to receive ownership of LP tokens (albeit locked until the lock period is over)
* Tax Tokens: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and passively repay 12,500 APE as taxes are generated from the trading activity of the token. All taxes are diverted to repaying the loan until completed. The creator will then receive ownership of the LP, and release it to their creator’s address when the lock period is over.
* Liquidity Threshold: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and as the liquidity pool grows from net buying activity, a loan with interest is repaid via clawback. This means the user can select a 2x with a 25% interest to repay 12,500 APE when the liquidity pool contains at least 20,000 APE. This approach is generally regarded to be safest when a higher threshold is selected (as high as 5x is available). This process is an automated repayment method.

Another product is the liquidity locker. All created tokens are automatically opted into this feature with a minimum of 30 days, which begins when the loan is repaid in full. Tokens created outside the platform can also use this feature given they make a small payment in APE tokens. The lock period ranges from 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

Finally, Ape Express will be equipped with a mass sender contract and UI. This is for any creator wanting to do an airdrop or presale distribution manually.

Ape Express’ GTM strategy will include a referral/discount coupon program, initially to be issued by team members. In addition, APE stakers (10k tokens staked and up) will be able to generate their own referral and discount codes customizable up to 20% referral/discount mix.

An incentive program will also be put into action if approved for a grant. The tokens with the most activity, measured by volume and holders, will be awarded APE tokens every week for the token’s creator/treasury. These metrics are reset every week to further incentivize only currently active projects or new projects to receive such rewards.

Although we cant stop people from creating NSFW tickers on a permissionless blockchain we will have measures on our backend to hide any racist, hateful or pornographic material from our leaderboards. We can control what is represented on our platform and we will carefully monitor this to make sure we are in line with Apecoin guidelines

As outlined in the [new whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the TEL (Telcoin) capfactor from cap1 to cap2 ($1M -> $3M).

**The Proposal**

This proposal is to increase TEL cap tier from cap1 to cap2. TEL’s current liquidity surpassed >$3M with a total liquidity of $6.1M pooled. Tel pool can be found [here](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x6cb5c5cb789fae62ce5ce280e1fbc5dd3bbdad81/).

**What is Telcoin?**

Telcoin is a full stack financial platform built on ethereum and integrated with telecom and mobile money platforms globally, aiming to build the standard for Mobile Financial Services 2.0. Our launch product, Telcoin remittances, recently launched in Canada & the Philippines and is available in iOS and Android.
In addition to remittances, Telcoin is working to ship a suite of high quality, affordable, and compliant end user financial products powered by ethereum and TEL holders to a mass market of users. Balancer is a core building block which will power that vision.
TEL, the native asset of the telcoin platform, powers financial transactions, coordinates liquid, TEL holder powered markets for end users, incentivizes telecoms to connect with & provide value to the TEL Ecosystem and Telcoin platform, along with numerous other exciting use cases we will be introducing in the coming quarters.
We view Balancer as the most well positioned automated market maker to bring powerful, novel end user financial use cases beyond speculation to the mass market and we have designed numerous smart pools we intend to commercialize.
The TEL/ETH 80:20 Balancer pool, an active TEL liquidity mining program pool (since October 2020), sits at USD$6.1million TVL and USD$1.4million in 24 hour volume. TEL liquidity providers have already begun voting on proposals with their mined BAL tokens. We view the idea that users of the Telcoin platform will own and contribute to the governance of the underlying decentralized protocols they use every day as one of the most exciting innovations uniquely enabled by crypto, and, at scale, hope to contribute thoughtfully to the governance of balancer.",bearish

856,"## Simple Summary

This Snapshot vote establishes community consensus on whether:
1. New assets are not required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%, or
2. New assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.


## Motivation


Since Gauntlet began its partnership with the Aave protocol, we have received requests from the Community to analyze asset listings. Community members, developers, and other stakeholders often asked us questions like, ""how much liquidity should this asset have before being listed? What should the asset's initial parameters be? How do we protect the protocol from insolvency?"" 

Gauntlet's framework focuses specifically on market risk and how Gauntlet will support the asset listing process in Aave. Our framework can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/gauntlet/Aave-Asset-Listing-Framework-Market-Risk-7c29d448924f444abfa9681410c707c3). This will work in conjunction with [Aave's existing asset listing framework](https://docs.aave.com/governance/guides/new-asset-listing). 

Listing assets is essential to the growth of the protocol. As new assets in DeFi proliferate and older assets fall out of favor, Aave must list and delist assets to maintain its usefulness as a protocol. Gauntlet will conduct these risk assessments prior to new assets being listed, given 2 weeks of notice and strong community buy-in.

Notably, we recommend that LTV and Liquidation Threshold be set to 0% on the initial listing. In other words, assets will not be allowed to be used as collateral upon their initial listing. 

Historically, the community has listed assets with non-zero LTV and Liquidation Threshold. Because there are risks in doing so, this Snapshot vote helps the community align on best practices moving forward.


## Specification

Community input is valuable because requiring that assets are listed with an initial LTV of 0% imposes important trade-offs:

1. Not requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can potentially allow the asset to have more utility (depending on the asset) from the onset of listing. Thus, the protocol may be earning revenue at the onset of the listing (driven by increased borrows). However, when assets are enabled as collateral from the initial listing, the protocol immediately faces the technical and market risks inherent in adding another risk vector to the protocol. The protocol is only as strong as its weakest link.
2. Requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can protect the protocol from unforeseen mechanism, smart contract, and other technical risks. In addition, setting an initial LTV of 0% allows the protocol to observe how supply and borrow usage as well as liquidity conditions evolve following the asset listing. This data enables more robust risk analysis and fine-tuning of LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters following the initial asset listing. The tradeoff is that until an asset is enabled as collateral, usage may be limited (depending on the asset), and thus, the protocol faces an opportunity cost of revenue. We view this as a minuscule opportunity cost (e.g., a few weeks of revenue attributable to the asset) relative to the risks. Assets can be turned on as collateral, but being turned off as collateral is a more difficult process with increased user friction.


Option 1 above should not be interpreted as suggesting that all assets should be enabled as collateral. It simply allows for the possibility that assets can be listed with an initial non-zero LTV should the community deem the asset a collateral asset.

Should the community favor Option 2, assets should be listed with an initial LTV of 0%, and a separate proposal must be proposed by the community at some point after the initial listing to enable the asset as collateral. At that point in time, given strong community buy-in, Gauntlet will conduct market risk analysis to recommend LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters.

## Next Steps


* This Snapshot vote has the below options:
1. Not all assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.
2. All assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%. After 2-3 weeks of operation as a non-collateral asset, the community can propose turning it on as collateral. At that point, Gauntlet will make parameter recommendations as per our Notion document below.

title: [ARFC] Set Metis Foundation Wallet as Emission Manager for METIS Token on Aave V3 Metis Pool
author: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative
date: 2023-07-05
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes to set the Metis Foundation wallet as the emission manager for the METIS token on the Aave V3 Metis pool. This will enable the Metis Foundation to define and fund incentive programs for this Aave pool, promoting growth and expanding the user base of this new Aave V3 market.

## Motivation

The Metis Foundation has expressed a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3 Metis pool. By setting their wallet as the emission manager for the METIS token, the Foundation will be able to directly fund incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets.

## Specification

The Metis Foundation wallet address is as follows:

Emission Admin Wallet (Metis Foundation): `0x97177cD80475f8b38945c1E77e12F0c9d50Ac84D`

The AIP call setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract.

`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(METIS, EMISSION_ADMIN);`

This method will set the Metis Foundation wallet as the emission admin for the METIS token.

## Disclaimer

This proposal is powered by Skyward. The Aave Chan Initiative has not been paid by any third party for this proposal.

859,"#### Upgrade of UniWhale’s Liquidity Pair for Farm Rewards from v2 to v3 

We are proposing to shift UniWhale’s Farm rewards from the current UNW-BNB v2 LP to the new UNW-BNB v3 LP.

We believe that transitioning to the UNW-BNB v3 pair will further incentivize the liquidity for the UNW token, and support healthy trading volumes for PancakeSwap. As a result of the concentrated liquidity model, the same amount of liquidity in v3, compared to v2, can support significantly larger trades.

For example, for a $500 trade, with a liquidity of $200,000 in the pool, v3 is about 8x more efficient than v2. (Assuming the v3 liquidity was added across a price range of +/- 25% of the current UNW price.)

#### The New Farm:

The proposed new Farm will have doubled emissions for the first 7 days. For example, if the v2 farm is emitting 10 CAKE per day, the proposed v3 farm will emit 20 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and 10 CAKE per day thereafter. 

Other differences are the change of the liquidity pair and moving from the v2 farm to the v3 farm. 

Previous v2 Farm:
- Stake UNW-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.2x multiplier
- **8 CAKE per day**

New v3 Farm (0.25% fee tier):
- Stake UNW-**BNB** LP, earn CAKE
- 0.4x multiplier (0.8x multiplier for the first 7 days)
- 16 CAKE per day for the first 7 days and **8 CAKE per day** thereafter 

In the future, the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other 0.4x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### What is UniWhale?

UniWhale is an oracle-based decentralized perpetual exchange, where users can trade BTC, ETH, and other top cryptocurrencies with leverage.

#### What is $UNW?
From the team: “UNW is the utility token of the UniWhale ecosystem that can be traded and transferred. UNW allows users to stake and participate in the distribution of its trading fee revenues and token emissions.

Users can convert UNW into esUNW (Governance token). With esUNW, users can participate in the project's governance.”

#### **⚠️⚠️⚠️BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING⚠️⚠️⚠️**

The official UNW token contract address on Binance Smart Chain is:

**https://bscscan.com/token/0x5b65cd9feb54f1df3d0c60576003344079f8dc06**

​Any other UNW token will be a scam. Always verify the token address before buying tokens. If you receive a UNW token airdrop from another address, it’s probably a scam, and we advise you to ignore it.",bearish
860,"#### Proposal for Adding CAKE Allocation to Bootstrap opBNB Liquidity

PancakeSwap is proud to be expanding to opBNB and join BNB Chain’s leading Layer 2. This expansion will continue our path towards creating the smoothest and most user-friendly DeFi journey for everyone.

When expanding to new chains, it is important to begin with a **bang** and sustain that momentum. To do so, we require the help of our community, and also **juicy APRs**. For clarity, the Kitchen **will not be increasing emissions** to enable these farms, and will instead by drawing from the “Multichain Warchest” allocation:

 
![](https://imgur.com/W94mOao.png)

The initial set of farms are listed below:

- **BNB/USDT** (0.05% fee tier): 100 CAKE per day

While we will endeavor to highlight new farm requests prior to launch, for reasons for competitiveness and confidentiality, we request for flexibility in distributing farm emissions to potential high-impact pairs. For clarity, these farm emissions will again be drawn from the Multichain Warchest, and will not be drawn from increased emissions. 

We will continue to publish confirmation proposals (Aptos example [**here**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x959b9da76401a7a3fb73e417b69ef51859383bd523d887350ae9f69148fc26a8)) once chain deployments have reached a steady-state and ensure that the community is satisfied with our deployments.

# Timeline

1️⃣ This Proposal is submitted (18 December 2023)

2️⃣ PancakeSwap deploys new farms on opBNB (if the proposal is successful)

3️⃣ Newly incentivized farms go live! All LPs are able to provide liquidity or launch new pools permissionlessly

4️⃣ Over the next few weeks, PancakeSwap observes traction and optimizes for new farms and adjustments to provide the best swapping experience on opBNB.

## Read before voting

Technical Documentation: Bridging Bitcoin To Avalanche: A Technical Overview | by Michael Kaplan | Avalanche | Jun, 2022 | Medium
Support Documentation: Avalanche Bridge | Avalanche Support

## Summary

This is a proposal to list BTC.b as a collateral asset. BTC.b is the bridged version of Bitcoin from the Avalanche Bitcoin bridge.

## Motivation

The Avalanche Bridge has become a cornerstone piece of infrastructure for the Avalanche community, introducing an innovative security model that uses Intel SGX technology to usher in a new era of bridge technology. The Bitcoin bridge will allow users to directly on and off-ramp from the Bitcoin network and enable Bitcoin users the chance to participate in DeFi. It is a seamless, easy and secure process.

## Driving Factors

Secure: the bridge must be audited and built with security-first technologies.
Cost-Effective: the cost of bridging assets should be low.
Fast: the transaction should take the least amount of time possible.
Transparent: users should be informed of the transfer status at every step of the process.
Intuitive: users new to crypto asset transfers can easily understand the steps to use the bridge.
Specifications

### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
The author of the AIP is a representative of the Ava Labs team.

### Provide a high-level overview of the project and the token

Ava Labs is the servicing firm behind the Avalanche blockchain. Avalanche is a network that is EVM compatible and can scale both vertically and horizontally through the subnet architecture and rollups. Avalanche subnets can also support custom virtual machines and many programming languages.

BTC.b is the Avalanche bridged version of native Bitcoin and is non-custodial and permissionless allowing for one of the best and easiest on/off ramps to the Bitcoin network.

### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good asset to borrow or use as collateral?

BTC.b is redeemable for the native version of BTC and might be the quickest, easiest and safest way to get BTC on-chain. As we have seen in recent times CeFi carries its own risks and BTC.b allows another avenue to get BTC on-chain.

BTC.b is already integrated into multiple DeFi protocols within the Avalanche ecosystem such as Trader Joe, Platypus Finance, Pangolin, Benqi, and Paraswap.

### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Avalanche’s primary network consisting of its X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain went live a little over a year ago with on-chain protocols launching around that time and since then has not had any downtime. C-Chain is an EVM-compatible contract chain and Avalanche subnets allow for horizontal scaling into a variety of virtual machines and languages.

The Avalanche Ethereum Bridge is the most popular Ethereum bridge in terms of TVL and the network has become very popular for DeFi, peaking at 2nd or 3rd in terms of TVL only behind Ethereum. Avalanche initially struggled to gain liquidity and traction but Avalanche Rush, Avalanche’s liquidity mining program that took place in the Autumn of 2021, attracted both Ethereum bluechip protocols and thousands of new users. Avalanche also has native stablecoins ensuring some of the bridge risks are taken away.

### How is the asset currently used?

Currently, there is about $28M worth of BTC.b bridged to Avalanche C-Chain. Some of the top protocols with BTC.b integrated include $30M of liquidity deposited in Platypus Finance, the Avalanche native stableswap, $2.6M of liquidity within the Benqi lending protocol, and $14M of liquidity for the AVAX-BTC.b pair within the AMM Trader Joe.

### Emission schedule
No emission schedule

### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

The bridge uses Intel SGX with a total of 8 wardens and the approval structure of 6 of 8. The wardens include Ankr, Blockdaemon, Chainstack, Protofire, Avascan, Ava Labs, Bware Labs, and Halborn. BTC bridging with Avalanche Bridge is not supported with Metamask or any other wallet other than the Avalanche Core Wallet. This is because the Core Wallet Extension was custom built to support Bitcoin and the Avalanche Bridge and to handle the technical problems of linking Bitcoin and EVM chains within a wallet.

The number of holders: 408

### How It Works/Technical Specifications

The Bridge can be broken down into two main parts: the SGX application and a set of third-party indexers and verifiers called “Wardens.” The Wardens are responsible for indexing the Avalanche and Bitcoin blockchains and submitting eligible transactions to the enclave for processing. The SGX application requires 3 of 4 Wardens to submit the same transaction before generating the signed transaction to process the Bridge transfer on the other network. For security reasons, neither the enclave nor the Wardens are directly accessible to bridge users. Instead, they’ll explicitly whitelist each other’s IP addresses for direct communication. In addition, all communication between the Enclave and Wardens will be encrypted and verified using TLS and include an HMAC signature. For relaying information to the Bridge user base, each warden hosts a JSON file containing the current bridge settings, assets requirements, and attestation report. The front end is set to disable itself if there’s any discrepancy within the critical information.

### Proposed Technical Parameters

BTC.b is proposed to start with a 70 percent max LTV, a 75 percent liquidation threshold, and a 6.5 percent liquidation penalty. With the level of on-chain liquidity and the ability to bridge from BTC.b back to native BTC quickly and exchange on centralized exchanges for native Avalanche stablecoins, these parameters are safe.",bullish

- `base.json` applies the standard permissions described in the tables above.
- `BIP-388A.json` sets protocol fees to 50% for swaps and yields (types 0 and 2)
- `BIP-388B.json` Wires the Gauge Factory up to the Psuedominter, adding and removing permisisons to do so in the process.
- `BIP-388C.json` Enables the authorizer wrapper, adding and removing permissions to do so in the process. 
## Risk Assessment
This is all part of the standard process for provisioning a new chain.  There are currently no deposits on base chain, this presents to risk to current protocol operations.

The Aave Companies are software developers who build open source, blockchain based software, including the Aave Protocol – an open source, decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users to supply and borrow crypto assets.

The Aave Companies have been a long-term user of the Balancer AMM, and currently hold the equivalent of ~252k BAL. This BAL was acquired through early investments and as rewards in exchange for participation in BAL boosted LPs. 

Given this support, the Aave Companies would like to engage in Balancer DAO governance through veBAL. 

**Risks**
The Aave Companies recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

**Specification**
Whitelist the Aave Companies’ Gnosis Safe multisig, 0xe8d4D93D9728bD673b0197673a230F62255C7846, to interact with the veBAL contract.",neutral

   * Keep Badger emissions for ibBTC and bcvxCRV on Ethereum, renBTC and Badger/WBTC on Arbitrum; remove the rest.
   * Allocate up to 8k Badger per week for testing new emissions programs/bribing/etc to be allocated at the discretion of the Badger Council.
   * Keep DIGG emissions the same as Q1 2022.
   * The net result is 20,000 BADGER per week emitted from the treasury in Q2 vs. 27,802 in the last week of Q1. This is a 28% reduction in emissions.
   * bveCVX is currently buying more than 12k BADGER per week and distributing it to its HODLers. This both creates buy pressure for more than half the treasury emitted tokens and makes up for the reduction in emissions to other Vaults.

**Vote:**

873,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes DexCheck ($DCK) to Syrup Pool!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a Syrup Pool with DexCheck! 

DexCheck is a decentralized analytics platform that employs AI and machine learning to deliver insights and analytics for crypto & NFT trading. 

For example, by tracking funds flows with custom-built tools, DexCheck provides traders with advanced, easy-to-understand insights to make data-driven decisions. 

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn DCK tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 1,450,000 DCK
 - **Distribution duration:** 90 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1600 UTC on 1 Aug 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1600 UTC on 30 Oct 2023 
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.5594 DCK

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours of the Syrup Pool.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the DCK Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a DCK-BUSD (0.25%) v3 farm. 

The farm will have **4x** CAKE rewards for 90 days. During or at the end of the farm period, the farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

We request for further flexibility in the multiplier, fee tier, and duration of the DCK farm. The aggregate CAKE emission to all DexCheck farm(s) will remain the same, but we may adjust the multiplier, fee tier, and duration of the farm(s) to ensure high utilization rates, ultimately maximizing CAKE burn from trading volume.

#### What is $DCK?

From the team:

“The DCK token has the following utilities:

- **DexCheck PRO Unlock**: DCK stakers are able to unlock data analytics tools such as the Smart Money Dashboards and InsightsGPT
- **Staking Rewards**: Users can stake their DCK tokens to earn rewards in the form of additional DCK tokens or other digital assets
- **Telegram Bots Revenue Sharing (planned for late-Q3)**: DexCheck’s Telegram bot services generate fees, of which a portion will be shared with DCK holders
- **Private Sales Access (planned for Q4)**: DCK token holders are given early access to new platform features and investment opportunities on Private Sales selected by DexCheck Ventures
- **Governance (planned for Q4)**: DCK token holders can participate in the platform's governance process by voting on proposals related to platform upgrades, fee structures, token burns, and other important decisions”

We believe in the following:
1. To achieve the goal of growing the ApeCoin ecosystem, a core focus should be on increasing its use as a form of payment. Even within a bear market, NFT sales/trading continues to be one of the largest crypto-native economies.
2. Projects should have their own marketplace, and the time is now for Yuga Labs & Otherside Partner NFT collections to have our own.
3. It is time for a NFT Marketplace to evolve and serve the needs of the larger NFT economy. One that expands beyond the sale of NFTs but includes additional components like Intellectual Property.

We also believe actions speak louder than words. Instead of offering to build a marketplace, we built one first. It is currently live on the temporary URL: apecoin.x.xyz with the IP marketplace going live if the proposal passes. This allows the community to try the marketplace before voting.

**Protocol Description:**

Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.

Inverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;

* On the supply side of money markets by Inverse Finance's “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.
* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA-3POOL through our partnership with Yearn (currently $93M TVL).
* Via purchase with DAI stablecoin using[ The Stabilizer](https://www.inverse.finance/swap/DAI/DOLA).

DOLA is not ""algorithmic"" and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.

**Motivation:**


The Inverse Finance Team aims to be a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions utilizing Redacted Cartel’s Hidden Hand (“HH”) platform to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. 

Current onchain liquidity for INV-DOLA is sitting at just over $800,000 between Sushi and Uni LP. The Sushi pool is incentivized through our own platform with around 950 INV per month (~$75,000 at current prices) in rewards and this has brought $366,000 in depth. This is a poor return, which we believe is due to our platform, Frontier, not having borrows active since June 2022. We believe we can achieve much better ‘ROI’ by migrating INV-DOLA liquidity to Balancer and making full use of the bribe efficiency of the Aura / Balancer platforms, this is as there are way more users checking the platform regularly for yield opportunities. 

Once the 50/50 INV-DOLA pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer.


**Specifications:**

You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    

Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to the DOLA-3CRV[ Curve](https://curve.fi/factory/27) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. This includes[ Frontier](https://www.inverse.finance/frontier) and any lending market officially partnered with Inverse Finance. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

A custom INV oracle with both a price ceiling and borrow cap feature has been in use following a price manipulation[ incident on April 2nd](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/our-plan-making-good). This oracle has been reviewed by Peckshield and is actively managed by Inverse’s Risk team.

Inverse Finance’s new lending market is due to release later this year after audits and will use ChainLink price oracles. Inverse Finance's old lending market relied on both ChainLink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable.

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

Inverse DAO has recently established a working relationship with Peckshield. A first round audit of a recent product was produced ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWNG08mib2GcI1WqnMt5IdFoW73QU2F8/view?usp=sharing)), and an audit of relevant legacy code is in progress. The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. A recent announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:

* Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.
* Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.
* Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 9 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.
* Fed Chair: 2 of 5 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts.

Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).

DOLA stablecoin is fully decentralized, with no possibility to pause or blacklist any addresses, even if INV governance wanted to do so.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

Inverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the “Feds”, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLA’s Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. Please see our graph below of DOLA’s peg YTD.![|689x138](upload://s74SFpZeIWsGgZeDWzoPMZIgTV9.png)
 
6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) 

This pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for INV on decentralized exchanges.",neutral
881,"#### ABSTRACT

We propose to thank (reward and recognize) decentralized contributions to ApeCoin with $APE, charitable donations, and an on-chain thank you note. We will do it in a way that is scalable, automated, bot-protected… and rewards truly valuable contributions.

Thank APE is critical DAO infrastructure that can enormously increase opportunity, utility, and value for APE holders. We can encourage and thank the following categories of utility-creating contributions across platforms:

- Governance participation
- Onboarding & education
- Intra-DAO collaboration
- Defi & web3 partnerships
- Community building
- Completing Core Tasks
- Art and culture innovations
- Infrastructure innovations
 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiab26bgkpfdfvgjzsombx4mxjfrl6djyoiyhrgbu7ehjiyrdnk3ze)

How it works
1. ApeCoin members are auto-rewarded with $APE + on-chain thank you notes for valuable, decentralized contributions to the DAO.
2. Members can keep rewards or donate them to approved charities that accept $APE.
3. Sophisticated tech automates and scales thanking and filters out bots and bad actors to ensure real, valuable contributions are rewarded.

Team
- Our Thank APE advisory board are seven OG BAYC and ApeCoin members. We are long-time community contributors with diverse backgrounds and skill sets. We are committed to ensuring Thank APE creates extraordinary value for our DAO.
- Our Thank APE tech is supported by ThriveCoin. We are web3 natives and VC funded. Our leadership team has scaled tech to support millions of users. We are also long-time BAYC and ApeCoin community members.

Funding (one time)
1. $0 to start. 100% performance-based. Thank APE is rewarded only when we create value for ApeCoin.
2. 0 $APE to 33.3k $APE / month (up to 200k total) allocated ONLY to ApeCoin members who make contributions that create value for our ApeCoin community.
3. 0 $APE to 7k $APE / month (up to 42k total) for all tech, dev setup, servers, maintenance, white-labeling, integrations, support, and customization [offsets some infrastructure costs].
4. $0 after six months: We’re building sustainable funding for Thank APE through exciting collaborations with core ApeCoin infrastructure you’ve voted for!

Milestones
- January: Community feedback and Snapshot vote!
- February: Launch within 1 month of positive vote
- March: Reward 30+ ways to contribute at launch
- July: Reward 100+ ways to contribute by month 6
- August: Fully sustainable funding model after six months
- Monthly: Improve core DAO engagement metrics by >10% each month!

Why we made this proposal

We love this community. Our expertise is in driving utility and value for communities by automating and scaling decentralized rewards. We believe now is the time for ApeCoin to harness core infrastructure that can profoundly increase excitement, demand, and value in our DAO!

Title: [ARFC] Orbit Program Renewal May 2024 
Date: 2024-05-13
Author: Marc Zeller - Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)
---

## Summary

Proposing the renewal of the Orbit program for recognized delegates, compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement of Gas costs associated with their governance activity.

## Motivation

Orbit recognizes the added value of the Delegates in the decentralization & diversity of the Aave DAO. This compensation allows them to focus on aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance. The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter.

With the transition to Governance V3, a significant feature introduced is gasless voting via Gelato integration on the [DAO-run governance app](https://vote.onaave.com), making it easier for delegates to participate without the burden of gas costs. This innovation prompts the proposal to discontinue the general gas rebate program. However, recognizing the continued necessity for proposal creation and payload deployment activities, we propose maintaining targeted gas rebates for these specific actions.

## Specification

* **Period Coverage:** Blocks 19162697 (5th Feb 2024) to Block 19860031 (May 13th 2024)
* **Eligible Platforms:**
	+ EzR3al
	+ Stable Labs
	+ Saucy Block
	+ Areta
* **Gas Rebate:** Since this period is entirely covered by Governance V3, the Orbit program does not reimburse delegate vote gas as their vote is now subsidized by Gelato. We will continue to reimburse Service Providers for their Governance-related activity:

   + ACI : 2.74 ETH
   + TokenLogic : 0.641 ETH

* **Budget:** 60000 GHO and 3.381 ETH
* **Relevant Links:**
	+ [Script output](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gov-V3-May-2024-Script-Output-af8acc9d53874444b9a576e2329da28a)
+ [ACI's Orbit tracker](https://apps.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker)


## Next Steps
1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is achieved, move this proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.
3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage for implementation and funding allocation in cooperation with Aave Finance service providers via an ad-hoc AIP vote or bundled in one of their treasury management AIPs.

This proposal aims to expand the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem through the creation of an animated series pilot and three spin-off comic books, featuring characters owned by ApeCoin DAO holders. We envision a gritty, action-packed, and comedic, anime-inspired adaptation of the American Ape comic book series that prominently features ApeCoin as the primary currency of the Metaverse, reaching beyond the echo chamber of “Crypto Twitter” that is primed to be pitched directly to international streamers via our producing team’s existing development, production and distribution pipelines.

#### OVERALL COST

The team is requesting $300,000 USD in $APE to produce the animated series pilot and three (3) spin-off comics, expanding the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem’s lore and raising awareness of the ApeCoin ecosystem through an ongoing mainstream animated television show and secure an international distribution deal for the comic books.

897,"Title: [ARFC Addendum] Increase Supply and Borrow Caps for weETH

Date: 2024-05-21

Author: @ACI 

---

# **Summary**

This proposal asks for governance approval to raise the supply caps for weETH to accommodate growing demand. The goal is to balance risk with profitability, ensuring sustainable growth and optimized revenue.

# **Motivation**

weETH has been consistently hitting its current supply cap, reflecting substantial market demand. Increasing the cap will provide more liquidity for users, leading to higher borrow volumes and enhanced protocol revenue.

However, some voices from the community raised concerns about the speed of growth of weETH in the aave ecosystem and would like a slowed-down approach to allow the Etherfi & LRTs ecosystem to gain maturity.

# **Specification**

We propose governance to greenlight the Risk Stewards to raise caps according to market conditions and risk tolerance up to newly defined ceilings, with an aggressive or conservative approach.

1. Aggressive Approach: Increase weETH caps up to 1M weETH
2. Conservative Approach: Increase weETH caps up to 500K weETH

The implementation of new caps will be done via Risk Steward.

# Disclaimer

The ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.

# Next Steps

1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC Addendum], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage with 4 options: YAE (Aggressive Option,) YAE (Conservative Option),  Abstain, or NAY
2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, implement changes via Risk Stewards

899,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to hire a Head of Network Development to help oversee matters within theAPE Foundation, supporting our community in achieving its strategic goals and ensuring operational excellence. The Head of Network Development will be responsible for supporting daily operations, facilitating strategic planning, coordinating community engagement, and
representing the DAO in external affairs. Additionally, this role will be well-positioned to make recommendations for further improvements as needed. For clarity’s sake, this position does not equate to a chief executive officer or “leader”, but rather a critical support function for the APE Foundation and the DAO.

To optimize efficiency and create cost savings, this proposal also includes a proposed reduction in future Special Council members’ payments to offset the cost of this hire. The APE Foundation will be empowered to oversee the hiring process for this position, ensuring that all legal, tax, and other relevant considerations are thoroughly addressed and optimized. The Head of Network Development will serve at the pleasure of the Special Council, the DAO’s Advisory Board.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
As ApeCoin DAO continues to expand, the need for ongoing, dedicated, and professional support at the APE Foundation has become increasingly evident. A Head of Network Development will offer essential oversight, strategic facilitation, and operational management, ensuring the ApeCoin DAO fulfills its mission efficiently and effectively. This role is vital for maintaining momentum, building community trust, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the DAO. Additionally, this position will allow our Special Council to focus on their responsibilities as the Advisory Board they are intended to be.

##### OVERALL COST 
USD $120,000 per annum paid in $APE. However, we will reduce Special Council member payments to offset this cost. Effectively makes this proposal zero additional cost to the DAO up to USD $125,000 once the reduction of the Special Council members payments kicks in (January 1, 2025).

APE Foundation could use its discretionary authority to go over USD $125,000 per annum if a competitive salary for this role is deemed necessary.

[ARC] - ERC4626 Strategies as Productive Collateral
Status: Discussion
Author: @llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham
Created: 24-10-2022

---

# Summary

@Llamaxyz is proposing the introduction of a new productive collateral type that allows users to earn the rewards of other protocols by depositing into Aave v3 Reserves.

With the support of the community, Llama will develop ERC4626 strategies that enable Balancer v2 and Curve Liquidity Provider tokens to be deposited as collateral. Users will earn the rewards from the respective Aura Finance and Convex Finance gauges whilst being able to draw a loan against the productive strategies.

This new type of collateral is expected to drive borrowing demand for listed assets and generate additional revenue for Aave DAO by sending 5% of the earned rewards to the DAO.

# Introduction

To support the continued growth of Aave, new types of collateral are needed to unlock emerging segments of the market. Llama proposes onboarding productive assets that are supportive of enhancing capital efficiency through unlocking new utility for user funds.

Currently, there is $4.4B deposited in Convex Finance and Aura Finance, and when Optimism enabled liquidity mining on Aave v3, Total Value Locked (TVL) on Aave increased almost 13x from $36M to $460M. Llama seeks to create the new type of collateral standard and onboard the first BPT and crvLP as collateral on the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

The new collateral type will be listed with SupplyCaps in place, borrowing disabled, and eMode created to shape how users interact with the new pools.

# Motivation

To understand how this strategy works, we will first walk through an example that demonstrates the user experience. In this example, the user deposits a BPT into Aave and claims rewards generated by the Aura Finance Gauge.

![|602x137](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UEG-zIyQMzitglXnGyu4ZMmRnVtXSYsJjhm_LjqBpReHh-tNVzzvBb8vyoD7eJFzvt9lABwS05mrQih-W3cbqGxcqxfgcrA61g2ndRcW712wJd-FdfsrIUf45muVoFnrGqN2-z0FNgUkwF3Dqu7ezygzvabjp2EeS4bVxLFpjnsg4lEJzJnJ061E1A)

The use,r having already invested in a Balancer v2 Liquidity Pool, deposits the BPT into the Aave Reserve and receives back aBPT. The Aave Reserve receives the user’s BPT and deposits it into an Aura gauge. The rewards generated from staking the BPT in the Aura Finance gauge are claimable by the user without needing to redeem the BPT deposit. When the user claims the rewards, 5% are sent to the DAO and 95% to the user.

The productive strategy can also be used as collateral.This creates much more utility for BPTs as users can then borrow against the productive strategy. Apart from levered farming of rewards, users can create buy-now and pay-later strategies that utilize future incentives to pay back the loans. This also creates an opportunity for other communities to build automated strategies that manage rewards and collateralization ratios for users that further streamlines the user experience.

![|602x235](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jl2OPISXT0kDtOH-oVwMo9wIdjlhvJn7xyi7SrYsJihE8ceu_nMNh-jCtk6Jdte1IZ9NJp5MZbA8fIBSrm3lO8895wpPAcBh8gcOfufHwJnUddOzQ02mdgtrolgGFNJgoIjkHVZrw8W9IEKwKBVawv7Lm3LSb1ulLSGKlYMOCTYYzVitpySH5E4HBw)

The DAO can decide if pools such as Balancer Boosted Aave Pool (bb-a-USD) and future GHO pools, (bb-a-USD / GHO) can be listed as collateral. Leverage in this application would exhibit similar recursive behavior to that which is occurring on Optimism and could lead to significant volumes of GHO entering circulation over time. If this was to occur, it would have a positive effect on the DAO’s revenue.

It is important to note that, although this proposal mentions Balancer and Aura Finance, the same concept applies to Curve and Convex. The initial deployments are to utilize Aura gauges, with a Convex integration to follow.

# Next Steps

A Snapshot will follow this ARC to determine whether the community would like to move forward with creating this new type of collateral.

If the community votes positively for the development of the upgrade to enable the new type of productive collateral to be onboarded, Llama will set about designing and creating the upgrade. Llama will commit to following best practices and working closely with other stakeholders within the community in developing the new collateral type. In the lead up to deployment on the Aave protocol, further governance approval will be required.

In the future, the community will also be able to decide via Snapshot whether to provide retroactive funding to reimburse the cost associated with the auditing of the new collateral type and how much funding to provide.

A separate Snapshot proposal will emerge where the initial asset listing will be proposed, with contributors such as Gauntlet and others potentially playing a role. Upon agreeing on the initial asset to be listed and whether audit costs are to be reimbursed, an on-chain vote will be submitted for governance approval to transfer funds and introduce the upgrade. This loosely follows the methodology presented in the GHO proposal.
# Conclusion

This ARC is focused on introducing and getting community feedback on introducing Aave’s newest productive collateral to the protocol.

We look forward to hearing community feedback on all aspects of this proposal.",neutral

## title: [ARFC] ACI Phase II
author: @marczeller - Aave-chan Initiative
date: 2023-10-17

---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the continuation of the collaboration with the Aave-chan Initiative (ACI) for an additional period of 180 days, with a proposed budget of 375k GHO.

## Motivation

![image|1920x1097, 50%](upload://9xBM448LftJoHXyBmCPgIOHzLd7.jpeg)


The ACI has demonstrated significant value to the Aave ecosystem across multiple fronts. This proposal seeks to extend our collaboration, focusing on three primary axes: Skyward, Growth, and Representation.

### Skyward:

![image|2000x559](upload://22rgZUXRYxc6uOrlNotwo8BiZ6l.png)


Skyward has emerged as a cornerstone of Aave's governance, producing 90 AIPs in 180 days. This averages out to **[one AIP every other day](https://dune.com/alice_rozengarden/aip-creation-in-2023)**, a testament to the relentless dedication and efficiency of the ACI. Beyond numbers, the ACI has fostered a spirit of collaboration within the Aave ecosystem.

We've co-authored proposals with the vast majority of active DAO service providers, recognized delegates and some active community members. Moreover, our doors have always been open to third-party protocols. By actively welcoming and collaborating with them, we've streamlined the governance process, ensuring that Aave remains inclusive and cohesive in its approach.

**What to expect for phase II?**

Continuation & extension of the Skyward services.

### Growth:

![image|2000x1088](upload://qjlOWocj80wUPeSHio06wG9yJBp.jpeg)


The ACI operates under a guiding principle of ""**Continuous incremental improvement.**""

While we acknowledge that we might not be the driving force behind tech breakthroughs like a potential Aave V4 or, recently, the Governance V3 AIP, our daily commitment is unwavering. We aim to make the protocol 1% better every single day, one AIP at a time. It's through these consistent, small steps that we believe Aave can maintain its leadership in the DeFi space.

Our efforts have already borne fruit. The implementation of offboarding plans for assets like BUSD & TUSD stands out. These initiatives not only enhanced protocol safety but also turned a profit, generating close to 1M$ for the DAO. This revenue, in itself, has multiple times repaid the investment made in the ACI. Furthermore, our vigilant oversight of the DAO's finances has ensured efficiency. We've curbed overspending, optimized budgets, and deterred proposals that didn't align with Aave's best interests, saving the DAO a 7-figure amount & ensuring every GHO & DAO $ is well spent.

**What to expect for phase II?**

The ACI will continue to focus on our continuous incremental improvement doctrine, being a driving force in Aave protocol growth and BD.

For Phase II the main focal points will be on Liquid Staking Tokens diversity with the support of onboarding new assets, GHO growth and adoption with support of synergies and the integration of GHO in both onchain protocols, ramps & L2s.

### Representation:

The ACI has actively engaged in both internal and external representation for the Aave DAO.

**Internal Representation**:

Prior to the ACI's involvement, the DAO too often encountered challenges, such as proposals not reaching the required quorum. Governance activity was subdued, and the operations were notably insular. The ACI introduced several key initiatives:

- **Orbit Program**: The ACI allocated ~20% of its budget to the Orbit program, focusing on diversity. This program compensates recognized delegates for their contributions, leading to increased participation rates and improved diversity metrics. The frequency of proposals failing due to a lack of quorum has decreased. With the now DAO-funded Orbit program, **the DAO has enshrined these benefits**
- **Governance Guidelines**: The ACI contributed to the establishment of the Aave DAO governance guidelines. This effort aimed to bring clarity, predictability, and efficiency to DAO governance. The ""**Minimal Viable Bureaucracy**"" ACI Doctrine, ensures a balance between structured governance and accessibility.
- **Support for New Delegates**: The ACI has extended support to emerging delegate platforms, co-authoring proposals and providing guidance. This collaborative approach has enriched the DAO's ecosystem.

**What to Expect from Phase II?**

We will continue contributing to the Aave DAO frameworks and supporting DAO active participants seeking a balance between organization & accessibility.

We will also delegate engineering resources for service providers via mini-dapps such as the recent [acistreamcollector.com](http://acistreamcollector.com), which allows no code claims of DAO streams.

**External Representation**:

![image|1920x1423](upload://o68ggEFjWsJdbQHaC8hqxPvL6sV.jpeg)


Externally, the ACI has been a voice for the Aave DAO in various capacities.

- **Event Participation**: The ACI has participated in and sponsored several global events to share insights and collaborate with industry peers. In 2023, our engagements included:
    - Web3DNA (Paris)
    - EthDubai 2023
    - Prague DeFi Summit/EthPrague
    - Stable Summit (Paris)
    - EthCC[6] (Paris)
    - Dappcon Berlin 2023
    - LëtzStake (Luxembourg)
    - EthLisbon
    - Devconnect Istanbul
    
    A detailed list of our engagements can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/f676c1ce96f44c648ef2a40f7f1bb442?pvs=21).
    
- **Regulatory Engagement**: The ACI's founder holds the position of president of the DeFi committee of the French Lobby ADAN. This role involves dialogues with regulators, institutions, and governments in France and Europe regarding the DeFi sector. The ACI has been involved in discussions related to the ""Mica 2"" regulation, which addresses DeFi services.

The ACI, as one of the voices for the Aave DAO, has consistently worked towards enhancing the DAO's presence and reputation in the broader ecosystem.

**What to Expect from Phase II?**

The ACI will continue to be one of the voices of Aave across the globe, supporting devs in hackathons, being one of the DAO voices during events and supporting our brand quality.

In addition to donating cryptocurrency directly to charities, the PancakeSwap Charity website could also offer a ""Charity Swap"" feature that allows users to swap their cryptocurrency for a token that represents a specific charitable cause. For example, a user could swap their CAKE tokens for ""Clean Water Tokens,"" which represent a charity that provides clean water to communities in need.

914,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp-2-0/2548).

# Motivation 

Almost four months ago, Balancer’s governance process was formally overhauled and handed off to the DAO through [this proposal](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x3bbcaaad4f0a928b8dabaf97bfd9679752254aee6e63597df32a7453663354d6). Overall I would argue the revamp did increase the transparency and effectiveness of our governance process but some critical problems have become clear to me lately.

The ultimate authority of our governance process is BAL token holders. Currently, in order for a proposal to proceed for a vote it must have a majority of the Gov Council signal that the proposal has reached “soft consensus in the community”. Ballers and DAO contributors represent the majority of active community members. It’s not a stretch to imagine a scenario where large token holders support a proposal but the Ballers/active community do not. We have created a system where the Gov Council acts as gatekeepers with full control over what proceeds to a vote and what doesn’t.

Thus, I would make the argument that “soft consensus in the community” should NOT be a factor when considering a proposal to move forward to a vote. We must avoid the situation where core DAO contributors are against a proposal that has large token holder support, and that proposal does not proceed to a vote because it lacks “soft consensus in the community”.

# Specification

The Gov Council will remain in place and their approval will still be required for a proposal to move to a vote. However, they will not vote on whether “soft consensus in the community” has been reached. Instead, the question will be “Is this a well defined proposal?”

What is the criteria for a “well defined” proposal?

* Includes a “Motivation”, “Specification”, and if applicable a “Risks” section
* If on-chain execution from the DAO Multisig is required, the “Specification” section must contain transaction details (address to send funds to, contract to interact with/function to call, etc)
* The intent of the proposal must be clear (not spam)
* BAL token holders must have the power to implement the proposal
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deposit the FEI in our treasury into a new degen farm. As part of the [subDAO formation proposal](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66), the power to farm was delegated to the Treasury subDAO. BAL token holders cannot vote on how we farm with non-BAL treasury assets, so this proposal would not proceed to a vote. However, a proposal to remove the power to farm from the Treasury subDAO is within the scope of BAL token holders. If this proposal passes successfully, then the proposal to farm with FEI could go to a vote.
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deploy Balancer to Optimism. Balancer Labs has sole discretion over core protocol development. BAL token holders do not have the power to compel Balancer Labs to act. It is solely the choice of Balancer Labs to create an official deployment of Balancer on Optimism, or not. Thus, this proposal would not proceed to a vote as BAL token holders lack the power to implement it.
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deposit 100k BAL to Aave to earn a yield. BAL token holders have the power to allocate BAL held in the treasury, so as long as the other criteria for a “well defined” proposal are met, this would proceed to a vote.

If the Gov Council fails to execute their duties in good faith and votes against a “well defined” proposal proceeding to a vote, a proposal to replace the Gov Council with a different mechanism should be made ASAP.

**Finally, this proposal would also implement a required minimum quorum of 100k BAL. Any snapshot vote that does not reach 100k total BAL voted AND at least 51% voting in favor would be considered to fail.**",bullish

916,"## Summary

A proposal to make parameter changes on all V3 deployments and v2 Ethereum. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096/2?u=gauntlet).


## Motivation
Raising Uopt for USDT, DAI, FRAX to 90% can increase borrow revenue without adding excess risk. The market would need to move considerably abnormally for liquidation capacity to come into question for stablecoin collateralized liquidations for 90% Uopt.

Raising RF from 20% to 25% for USDC, USDT, LUSD on v2 Ethereum would help bring RF parity for USDC, USDT, and LUSD to DAI, and help encourage supply migration from v2 to v3 (given [AIP-306](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=306) raised DAI RF on V2 Ethereum to 25%.)




## Specification

1. Raise Uopt to 90% for USDC, USDT, DAI, FRAX, where applicable, across all v3 deployments
2. Raise RF from 20% to 25% for USDC, USDT, LUSD on v2 Ethereum


**Disclaimer: Gauntlet reserves the right to not move forward with any parameter changes recommended in Snapshot polls, if market conditions change meaningfully. We will publish AIP for this change after the unfreeze/unpause of v2 and v3 markets from the [security incident on Nov 4](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v2-v3-security-incident-04-11-2023/15335).**

919,"title: [ARFC] increase caps for MAI Aave Polygon V3

Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative

Dated: 2023-02-02

Summary
MAI is a decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin minted by the QiDAO protocol

MAI is minted by qiDAO protocol users by locking collateral in vaults.

For more information about MAI please refer to MAI V3 ARC 2

This ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to increase MAI borrow cap on the Aave V3 polygon market.

Abstract
This ARFC proposes to increase the MAI borrow cap to 1M MAI to reflect market demand for this asset.

Motivation
Due to market demand for MAI liquidity, MAI utilization is close to borrow cap, and the current borrow cap is set at a level that has a probable effect on both MAI supplied (total cap making it impossible to reach uOptimal at the current level of liquidity) and drives out potential demand.

Allowing an increase of this borrow cap will allow supply and demand to find another equilibrium for the benefit of liquidity providers, borrowers & protocol revenue with expected increased borrow demand.

The new proposed cap is set at a level that allows the market to find this new equilibrium while maintaining a conservative approach.

920,"##### ABSTRACT

The following provides a framework and rules for polling the Ape Community, known as Ape Temperature Checks (ATC), for various inquiries.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Temperature checks would allow the community, AIP authors, and others, to gather information by polling the community on a topics to get an understanding of how the community feels about an idea. While this can be done on any platform, it would be ideal to perform these temperature checks on the same platform (i.e. SnapShot) as normal voting occurs in order to better reach community members who are currently participate in voting for ApeCoin DAO.

##### OVERALL COST 
Zero cost, as this is only administrative.

921,"This proposal also appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allocate-bal-to-aave-weth-stakers/1909).

As part of [Aave’s Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module), an 80/20 AAVE/WETH pool was created which has since grown to be the largest pool on Balancer v1. The creation of this pool, along with the dual incentives of BAL + AAVE, established a strong partnership between Balancer and Aave. That partnership has continued with the ongoing development of the Aave Asset Manager (AM), which will be the first AM deployed on Balancer v2.

**Motivation**

Given the critical importance of the Safety Module, Aave requires additional time to migrate their pool to Balancer v2. In order to preserve the allocation of 12,500 BAL per week the pool was receiving before v2 Liquidity Mining started, we need to give Ballers the authority to allocate BAL to the 80/20 AAVE/WETH pool on v1.

**Specification**

The Ballers will initially allocate two Tier 2 slots and one Tier 3 slot for a combined 12,500 BAL per week - this will be reflected in the next weekly vote on the Baller-only snapshot. Going forward, the Ballers will have sole discretion to adjust this pool’s allocation as they see fit. The BAL allocated to this pool by the Ballers will go directly to users who have staked BPT from this pool in the Safety Module, meaning if you enter this pool and do not stake in the Safety Module you will not get BAL rewards.This pool will no longer be included in the v1 reward calculations.

Note: Aave has agreed to a three month migration deadline. BAL rewards will be provided during this time period, though not necessarily at the full 12,500 BAL per week. Ballers can choose to lower the amount if they deem it appropriate. At the end of three months, if they have not migrated to v2 then BAL rewards for their pool will end. The migration deadline will be September 20th, 2021.",bearish

This proposal seeks to update the [Apecoin.com](Apecoin.com) website to include a “Treasury” tab.

The purpose of this proposal is to address a lack of transparency around the size of the ApeCoin DAO treasury and the rate at which treasury funds are being spent.

This proposal requires that the “Treasury” tab include a live counter that tracks the size of the DAO treasury, the amount of the DAO treasury that has been spent, the rate of current spend of DAO funds, and the estimated time when the treasury would be depleted at the current spend rate.

924,"# TLDR:

Gauntlet makes the following recommendations to optimize for risk and capital efficiency for Venus:

- Reduce BNB Collateral Factor from 80% to 75%
- Increase Borrow Caps for BCH from 4,331 to 7,000
- Increase Borrow Caps for FIL from 122,200 to 180,000


## Collateral Factor Recommendations:

- BNB: Lower CF from 80% to 75%.
 - *To clarify, Gauntlet ran an updated analysis of the protocol and this adjustment is still being recommended.*


# Methodology
This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Existing insolvencies are excluded from our simulations and VaR and LaR numbers, since we can only mitigate risk of future insolvencies. Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the Gauntlet’s Venus Risk Dashboard cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

## Risk Off Liquidations:
Whenever we lower collateral factors, there’s a chance that some users may immediately become liquidatable as a result. There are a number of accounts that lend and borrow stablecoins and keep their balances just slightly above the liquidation threshold.

Reducing the collateral factor of BNB by 5% would push 115 accounts from just above the collateral factor to just below the collateral factor. The accounts have a total borrow value of $13k. The top account has a borrow balance of $2.5k. Most of the accounts are extremely small with recursive holdings.

## Supporting Data
**Top 10 Borrowers and Borrow Usage**
 
![1](ipfs://bafkreihfj5buex27s6t5wnq6ohj67o2hwc44hm2ml6hcaw6zrcwpydzhae)

![3](ipfs://bafkreiamx5jnhozrggkbhypvzr3wx4odmi35y4rm6kz6h5hr56leley5li)
        

The figures above show the distribution in risk among the top borrowers. A large amount of BNB is concentrated in one borrower, which could lead to insolvencies. Because of this, we can observe why a large portion of the VaR is in BNB.

## Borrow Cap Adjustment Reasoning:
Gauntlet is adjusting the borrow caps for FIL and BCH to improve user experience, as previous caps were met. Borrow caps will continue to be monitored and incrementally updated to maintain protection against manipulation.

## Risk Dashboard
The community should view the Gauntlet’s Venus Risk Dashboard to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Venus.

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile insolvency value that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile liquidation volume that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

925,"#### PancakeSwap Welcomes APX Finance ($ALP) to Syrup Pool on opBNB!

Dear CAKE holders, we’re excited to announce a new Syrup Pool with APX Finance, the partner for PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2!

APX Finance is a decentralized derivatives exchange that designed the Permissionless DEX Engine, which powers PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on BNB Chain and Arbitrum.

For an update on how the product has performed thus far, please refer to the section **“Performance of Perpetuals v2 on Arbitrum”** below.

#### The Syrup Pool on opBNB:

Stake ALP tokens to earn CAKE tokens!


Syrup Pool on opBNB:
  - **Total Tokens:** ~11,250 CAKE + 427,500 APX (converted into CAKE)
 - **Distribution duration:** 45 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1000 UTC on 20 Dec 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1000 UTC on 4 Feb 2024
 - **Token rewards per second:**  CAKE (will depend on final CAKE amount)


The CAKE tokens used to fund these Syrup Pools will be provided by PancakeSwap and APX Finance equally. The final CAKE amount will depend on token prices at time of conversion.

On PancakeSwap’s side, the CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from the Syrup Pool will encourage more users to participate in PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on opBNB, increasing liquidity, which will ultimately lead to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

|:--:| 
| Image taken from our [**tokenomics page**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics) |

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

There will be no cap on how much CAKE a user can stake in the Syrup Pool. This is to encourage as much on-chain ALP liquidity as possible.

#### Performance of Perpetuals v2 on Arbitrum

Since the launch on 28 Aug 2023, PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on Arbitrum has achieved impressive results, surpassing $1 billion in cumulative trading volume and attracting over 1000 users., With the support of liquidity attracted through syrup pools, our platform has consistently secured a prominent position among the leading derivatives protocols on Arbitrum in volume.


| ![](https://i.imgur.com/v4088M1.png) | 
|:--:| 
| Image taken from our [**Dune dashboard**](https://dune.com/apollox/alp-v2-arb) |

Our previous Syrup Pool proposal successfully incentivized liquidity provision, which is crucial for facilitating trading on the perpetuals platform. We have currently attained more than $2 million in liquidity value of minted ALP tokens, of which ~$1.5 million are staked in our Syrup Pool.

[During the period of incentivisation, how much CAKE was spent on the ALP pool? How much CAKE was burnt instead? This will allow your community to understand the value-for-money]

Our goal is to establish a dominant position in the derivatives category on opBNB. This proposal seeks to kickstart liquidity provision in the ALP Pool to facilitate trading for the perpetuals platform on opBNB.

#### What is Perpetuals Trading?

**Disclaimer: This information presented in this proposal does not constitute any form of financial advice or recommendation, please do your own research before making any investment decisions.**

Perpetuals, perpetual swaps, or perps are a special type of futures contract without an expiration date.

Futures trading allows users to enter positions on margin (leverage) using borrowed funds to optimize capital. Using leverage allows a user to enter a position with a size that is larger than their account balance. For example, using 10x leverage, a user could trade 100 CAKE for the price of 10 CAKE. In this example, the initial margin would be 10 CAKE which is used to collateralize the leveraged position.

In PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2, we've streamlined our interface by removing the order book and market depth displays. Instead, our partner APX Finance has introduced the ALP pool, which now provides liquidity for all trading pairs, maximizing your capital usage. The ALP pool will actively participate in the market-making process for our V2 perpetual contracts. 

More information can be found in the documentation pages of [**APX Finance**](https://apollox-finance.gitbook.io/apollox-finance/welcome/trading-on-v2) and [**PancakeSwap**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/perpetual-trading/perpetual-trading-v2).


#### What is $ALP?

From the team: “ALP is APX Finance’s liquidity provider token made up of a pool of assets (USDC, USDT, DAI, ETH, BTC). Users can become liquidity providers by using any of the specified assets to buy ALP. ***ALP pool is the direct counterparty of V2 on-chain perp traders.***

The initial issue price of ALP is USD$1. The price of ALP is influenced by the profit or loss of the pool and income from trading fees, funding fees and liquidations.

In the future, APX Finance plans to support more utility of ALP on the platform such as earning transaction fee rewards, using ALP as margin for perpetuals trading, and participation in DAO governance and voting.

A step-by-step guide on buying, selling, and staking ALP can be found [**here**](https://apollox-finance.gitbook.io/apollox-finance/welcome/apollox-liquidity-pool/how-to-buy-alp)”

title: [ARFC] sDAI Onboarding on Aave V3 Gnosis Pool
author: @marczeller - Aave-chan Initiative
date: 09-10-2023
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain Pool. With the imminent deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain and the recent deployment of sDAI, we believe this integration will further enhance the utility and liquidity of the Aave ecosystem on Gnosischain.

## Motivation

- **Aave V3 Gnosischain Deployment**: The deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain is on the horizon. As outlined in the [Gnosischain deployment ARFC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-deployment-on-gnosischain/14695), sDAI was identified as a prime collateral candidate for Aave. However, at the time of the proposal's creation, sDAI had not been deployed.
  
- **Rapid Growth of sDAI**: Since its deployment, sDAI has shown significant traction, attracting $46M in just a few days. This demonstrates the community's trust and the potential of sDAI as a collateral asset in the Aave ecosystem.
  
- **Technical & Timeframe Considerations**: We propose the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain deployment, either as part of the initial deployment or through a subsequent onboarding AIP, depending on what's most optimal from both a technical and timeframe perspective.

## Specification

- **Asset**: sDAI
- **Contract Address**: 0xaf204776c7245bF4147c2612BF6e5972Ee483701

A Price sync adapter oracle considering both wxDAI value and sDAI exchange rate will be implemented as a Price feed for this asset.

### Risk Parameters

sDAI is intended to serve as a collateral asset. Given that there's minimal value in borrowing it, we propose its onboarding solely as a collateral asset, without borrowing capabilities.

ofcourse  a huge pot is fun to bet on but I rather have a 300K pot on 5 numbers and have a small chance to share it with someone, instead of a 100k 5 number pot and 200k on 6 numbers and no one ever hitting it.

Related Discussion: Our proposal is similar to [Voltz Additional Use Grant](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/should-uniswap-provide-voltz-with-v3-additional-use-grant/15669)

### What is Rage Trade?

[Rage Trade](https://rage.trade) is a new perpetual swap  protocol built using Uniswap v3. Many on-chain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs. However, traders and LPs benefit from v3’s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp.

### Why do we need an additional use grant?

Our proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol. Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3’s code but instead we have built on top of it. Think of Uniswap as our matching engine, and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading. We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswap’s core: leverage trading, leverage LPing, cross-margin, liquidations, and real time funding rates. 

### What changes have we made that require additional use?

We have built libraries to enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates. Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswap’s BUSL protect code (that we require an additional grants use for):

- [SimulateSwap](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/SimulateSwap.sol): This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage. It makes use of Uniswap’s TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries.
- [TickBitmapExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickBitmapExtended.sol): This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswap's TickBitmap, required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract.
- [TickExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickExtended.sol): This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade. They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3.
- [LiquidityPosition](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/LiquidityPosition.sol#L5): This library enables leverage liquidity providing (and the accompanying margin logic). It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so.


 ### How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap?

1. Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3: Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 (not a fork) all additional TVL + trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3.

2. Rage Trade will spend significant R&D resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie: Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 80-20 strategy that composes with Curve’s tricrypto.

3. Liquid & composable on-chain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies: Using perps, Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging. Additionally multi-collateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market. 

### Conclusion

Rage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswap’s value as a protocol. We look forward to discussing our proposal with the Uniswap community and answering questions in the comments below.",bullish

# Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider Proposal Q3 2024

## TL;DR

** Updated with revised compensation.**

With V3 set for imminent public code release, the grants program requests funding to target new V3 integrations, create a hook bounty program and partner with ecosystems to build more on Balancer with the new and improved DX. This quarter’s focus will be to find and fund projects launching on Balancer V3 to help boost wide adoption.

With this launch pending and a long history of performance, the committee requests funding for 3 months to continue to focus on funding in line with the findings in the [historical assessment report](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-program-all-time-recap/5458). 

Main points:

* Funding duration 3 months from July 1st to September 30th, 2024.
* Funding for new grantees - 75k BAL
* Grants lead compensation reduced by $3k, committee members to contribute pro bono
* Funding categories identified in 2023 Q4 Program Recap
* Attract more projects to build on V3 and port over pools from V2
* Run V3 hook bounty program
* Partner with supported chains for co-funding and more visibility

With unspent BAL in the treasury and the recovery of funds from stale grants, funding is requested to top up the treasury (currently 41,473 BAL uncommitted) to:

1. 75,000 BAL for new grantees (**33,527 BAL top up**)
2. 15,000 USDC for committee/support (**6,900 USDC top up**)

As always, we welcome comments and recommendations from the community on how to better develop the Balancer grants program.

______________________________________________________________________

**Service Provider Name:** Balancer Grants

**Leader(s):** Burns, with committee members John Grant, Mike B, Steve0xp and Zen Dragon.

**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 (or link to your own):** Yes

**Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines:** Yes

In accordance with the Balancer DAO [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1) and uphold those [proposed here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-balancer-dao-service-provider-grantee-standards/5808). This will include the Grant’s Committee:

* Developing a monthly report detailing key objective progress which is posted to the Balancer Forum and Medium
* Attending and presenting during the Baller weekly meeting (mandatory attendance by at least 1 representative)

The grants committee will undertake compliance checks and facilitate agreements between grantees and OpCo for funding amounts $20k and above.

#### Domain of Operation

After 12 waves of funding and a recap over the last quarter, this proposal seeks to continue the grants program as per [BIP-573](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-573-fund-balancer-grants-for-q2-2024/5650) to support the release of Balancer’s V3. The program will continue to offer up to $100K USD in BAL tokens per grant supporting the Balancer Protocol's mission to become a leading DeFi liquidity source, catering to both short-term and one-off projects, as an alternative to the Foundation SP model's focus on long-term and higher-cost engagements.

The Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee are below.

Following on from the quarter of reflections and [subsequent report and recommendations](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-program-all-time-recap/5458), the grants program will be focused on:

1. Continue to mentor and deliver with existing grantees

The program currently has 5 live grantees building assorted integrations, novel use cases for Balancer pools and educational resources. The committee has assisted projects to complete their milestones and intervened where the project has gone stale to recover funds for future grants. These projects total ~72k BAL of committed funds yet to be paid for outstanding milestones. These can be reviewed on our [Finalized and Live Grants Notion Page.](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/7d33d4a52c604b719958ab7ff8f1389e?v=2975616ba49e4dd88550c817e23505f9)

Deliverables: On-going support/management, monthly reports, coordination between Balancer entities.

2. Fund projects dedicated to increasing adoption of Balancer V3

With Balancer V3 launching in Q4 2024, grants will play a significant role in incentivising projects to:

* Integrate Balancer V3.
* Create educational content, tooling and docs to lower barriers to entry for teams building on V3
* Create new use cases with Balancer custom pools
* Bounties for highly active community members providing dev support, incentivising integrations for analytics sites etc

Deliverables: Live Grant assessment sheet, monthly reports, weekly meetings

3. Funding Initiatives

To expand the Balancer ecosystem we will be running the following specific initiatives:

* Run a hook bounty program

The program’s goal is to encourage experimentation and explore the bounds of what hook functionality can bring to Balancer pools through rapid development. These will be in the form of small awards for hook builders or audits for high quality and valuable contracts.

* Co-funding through agreements with supported chains

With new launches on chains such as Mode and existing chains who are seeking to expand development such as Polygon zkEVM, the committee has been in discussions with grant programs that are excited to jointly support projects building on Balancer and their ecosystem.

The two avenues that we will be taking are

1. General applications for funding through programs such as OP to expand our treasury
2. Project specific proposals through programs such as Polygon or Avalanche

4. Funding categories

Across these avenues of focus, categories to direct funding are:

|Category|Why / Why not|
| --- | --- |
|Analytics|Continuously improving analytics and encouraging existing projects to include Balancer drives volume to the protocol. Clear value.|
|Custom Pool Types|Custom pool types have the highest potential value to Balancer but are risky. These projects create new use cases and showcase Balancer technology.|
|Education / Tooling|Very important to make Balancer more user/dev friendly and drive adoption of building and investing in the platform.|
|Research|Research has been generally avoided after early failed proposals. Recommendation is to revisit funding research as optimizations or new use cases may prove valuable. Risky with low likelihood of payout but high potential payout.|
|Swap Aggregators|Swap aggregators create more revenue streams. Strategic grants may be considered.|
|Wrappers / Infrastructure|Can lower barriers to entry for other projects looking to integrate with Balancer and provide additional revenue streams|
|Yield Aggregators*|Only with a direct value calculation. There are generally sufficient incentives for yield aggregators. With no yield bearing assets, this is not worth funding.

If the aggregator has the potential to bring high volume and TVL of yield bearing assets, then a value calculation can be made.|

#### Grants Committee

The Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds. The committee remains an equal democracy with no person having a greater authority on what is approved or not. We rely on individuals’ expertise in different areas to help make informed decisions.

Burns - Committee Coordination Lead

John Grant - Committee Member/Mentor

MikeB - Committee Member/Mentor

Steve - Committee Member/Mentor

Zen Dragon- Committee Member/Mentor

The committee has the ability to onboard/offboard members as individual circumstances change throughout the quarter between funding proposals. Given the authority to approve and distribute grant funding, the committee can also self manage members within the approved budget.

The Grants Committee will continue to work closely with Balancer Labs, Ecosystem SPs and Ballers to amplify and support grantees.

By having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi.

#### Previous Performance

As a committee we have shown ourselves as:

* Diligent assessors of grant applications with intimate understanding of the DAO and protocol.

* Trusted to find and manage grantees building on core Balancer code alongside Balancer Labs. With one grantee being on-boarded to Balancer Labs.
* Fairly recover funds from stale grantees when no longer relevant saving ~30k BAL to date
* Prudent with spending to maintain the grants treasury and limit BAL expenditure
* Supporting grantees to completion by connecting with the resources required

Q2 Recaps: [April Monthly Report](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-april-2024-update/5739) and [May Monthly Report](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/grants-monthly-update-for-may-2024/5791)

#### Length of Engagement and Budget breakdown

This budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants SP for the period July 1st to Sept 30th, 2024. Unallocated resources will be kept to offset the next budget request if successful.

Committee Lead - $5,000 USD paid in USDC - mentor and provide support/coordination for all grantee teams, administration of grants docs, RFP development, prepare and present monthly reports, wave round up, grantee announcements, budget preparation and SP proposals, .

Committee members - pro bono as a part of other DAO SP roles

|Expense|Amount in BAL/USD|Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Q3 Grants|75,000 BAL|To be rewarded to grantees based on milestones following the full Grants review process. For sub $5k USD contributions a light review process will be utilized. Includes buffer for current approved grants in $USD to be paid in BAL.|
|1 Grants lead|$5k x 3 months = $15k USDC|The Grants Lead Role takes ownership of the establishment and operations of the Balancer Grant processes. The lead is responsible for coordinating with Committee Members, scheduling and hosting meetings, carrying out KYC/compliance due diligence, maintaining Medium and Notion pages and leading the post grants report.|
|Other Program Expenses|500 BAL|Any other program expenses that may be required for the smooth execution of the grants program. This may include (but is not limited to) to design, analytics, media, PR, research, legal, gas fees or any other specialized functions outside the skillset of the committee|
|Uncommitted Treasury|41,472 BAL & 8,100 USDC|
|**Total request for Q3**|**33,527 BAL & 6,900 USDC**|

#### Funds to Transfer: 33,527 BAL & 6,900 USDC

The Grants Committee multi-sig (currently 3 out of 5) will continue to operate with the remaining funds in the Grants treasury (0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597) carried over and approved to be delegated to the grantees.

Impact on the Treasury: The Treasury currently holds ~3.95M BAL. Funding Balancer Grants for Q3 is at a cost of 1.90% of the treasury’s BAL holdings (this is assuming all 75k BAL is spent on grantees), which annualizes to ~7.59%. The Treasury currently holds ~5.34M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost ~0.28% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~1.1%.

All transactions will be recorded in a Sheet maintained by the committee and on chain.

945,"I will start by looking at the big picture: 
1)	Cake wants to have liquidity, that’s a key goal for their business (The total Volume Locked). 
2)	Cake wants to have a strong burning rate, to be able to acheive a deflationary tokenomics model. 
3)	Every business that initiates an IFO on Pancake, wants to achieve 3 things a) Raise Funds, b)Growth of adoption, and c)Retaining their customers (to grow)

There are 25 Pancake Bunnies(PB) NFT types in this collection. We will adopt a points system that will be used to achieve the goals we mentioned above without sacrificing the tokenomics. We will use the most common PB as the baseline (Sleepy). This one has a total of 216,980. We will then give Sleepy 216,980 points, 1 point for every Sleepy NFT held. We will give every other PB type the same points, but with a different distribution, based on a weighted rarity system. For example, every Lottie NFT holder will get 12 points for every one they hold (Because it is 12x rarer than Sleepy). Same all the way up to The Baller, where every holder will get 5,166 points for every Baller held. The total points here will be 4,556,580. The good thing here is that it’s a points system, so this could scale if Pancake releases more NFTs in the future, using the same methodology I explained above. 

Now, let us assume a new token wants to make an IFO on PC (lets call it Bazabizo Token). They will use the same public sale mechanism + Private sale (with Squads NFTs as an enabler). However, the problem here is that users dump the tokens right after the IFO for an immediate profit. Now, the Bazabizo business gets the initial funding, but they lose a lot of users (because they sold early). I know that PC offers farms for that token, but then because a lot of dumping is happening, the price is very volatile, and users remove the liquidity because they are afraid of impermanent loss. If we enable an accelerated returns Farm for this token based on points, everyone wins. 

For example, we make an “Enhanced” farm for Bazabizo-BNB, and it yields 1% additional APY every week, until lets say 6 months. Users will need 1 point for every $1/week in that farm. So, if you put $10,000 in that pool and you have 50,000 points, you will be allowed to stay in there for 5 weeks, then auto-removed. You will get the LP tokens, that you could then use to farm in the ordinary pool. If this idea removed 10% of the selling pressure post IFO, then the Bazabizo business wins a lot of money! 10% less selling pressure could mean upto 50% price appreciation which means less impermanent loss, which means longer retention. On the other hand, if the token’s price is doing well, users in the “Enhanced” farm will be tempted to buy more PBs to get more points to stay in that Enhanced farm. Once users leave the enhanced farm, they keep their points always. Lastly, there are a lot of users who hold PB NFTs but they don’t participate in the IFO, they could then be tempted to buy the token to get into the Enhanced Farm. There are more than 200,000 holders of PB NFTs, that’s the best marketing for free a company like Bazabizo could have. 

The incremental yield given through the Enhanced Pool, shouldnt be large for PC. Its a maximum of ~$4.5M farm for 1 week at 1% incremental (in average, according to the total number of points as mentioned earlier). This shouldn't be more than ~$10K for every IFO (Happy to elaborate offline). On the other hand, if users like a certain Enhanced Pool, and then a new IFO is concluding, they will either leave the enhanced Farm (that they like) or buy more PB NFTs to participate in the Enhanced Farm for the new IFO. This will create volume. This mechanism, will create more volume for PB NFTs which reflects Cake burning. Simple Maths, every point costs ~$5 (the cost of Sleepy). So, if demand for the Enhanced Pool is increased to additional 500K points. That should reflect at least $2.5M trading volume no the PB collection, 2% of that is burned. Thats $50K! This is also a flywheel effect. The more Enhanced pools there is, the more users will buy PBs to enter, this means further volume and this could be accelerated. Every successful Enhanced Farm could bring 10-20% price appreciation to every point (Sleepy as a baseline), which means the burning associated with volume increases linearly with that, and so on. 

Ah, I forgot to say, that could be allowed for any given Farm, not only the newly formed IFOs. This could give tremendous added value. 

 Unfortunately, I am not allowed to add Excel sheets, that could've made it easier, but happy to do so offline.

946,"#### Proposal to recognize Mancake as an affiliate DEX

![](https://images2.imgbox.com/30/eb/VvGQPbIQ_o.jpeg)

Please refer to the following [**governance discussion**](https://forum.pancakeswap.finance/t/discussion-on-pancakeswap-affiliates-a-multichain-expansion-strategy/395) on the affiliate DEX proposal first raised by the Kitchen in late February and the Mancake team’s [**post**](https://forum.pancakeswap.finance/t/discussion-for-proposal-to-official-launch-mancake-as-a-pcs-affiliate-on-mantle-network/511/15) on our governance forum for details of the deployment.

Based on the above proposal from the Mancake team, the Kitchen proposes to recognize Mancake as an affiliate DEX on Mantle Network.

#### Rationale for recognition

This will allow PancakeSwap to grow on the Mantle blockchain network via a 3rd party affiliate team with strong execution capabilities to grow PancakeSwap’s influence and volume in a multichain world.

#### Summary terms

The Mancake team will require the following from the Kitchen and PancakeSwap
* Co-marketing support;
* Tech support as required, such as the full set of PCS-developed products without reliance on external partners (i.e. swap, liquidity, farm, upcoming PCSv4, staking, trading reward, Syrup pools, lottery, NFT, info, IFO) with tech support to help get Mancake up and running;
* At a future time, if Mancake also acts as a filler when PCSX is established, PancakeSwap will integrate such DEX into PCSX and preferentially execute trades via Mancake if the execution of the relevant token price is <1% worse than the best option available on Mantle

In return for the above support, the Mancake team will provide the following to PCS and veCAKE stakers

* Mancake allocates 3% of its supply to PCS (PCS will distribute one-third (1%) to veCAKE stakers)
* Mancake allocates an additional 3% of its supply to veCAKE stakers
* Mancake will pay PCS 60% of all deployed product revenues (e.g. ongoing LP fee revenues) monthly to the PancakeSwap protocol

#### Implementation

The implementation timeline post governance approval is laid out in Mancake team’s [**post**](https://forum.pancakeswap.finance/t/discussion-for-proposal-to-official-launch-mancake-as-a-pcs-affiliate-on-mantle-network/511/15) on our governance forum. TGE is expected in Q2 2024.

We also recognize the value of community feedback, and the Mancake team will continue to engage with the PancakeSwap community, as they have done regarding requests for details on team members, tokenomics, and further aspects of the affiliate deployment.",bearish

950,"**Summary:**

With the upcoming launch of multiple products utilizing Managed Balancer Pools, Index Coop is proposing a partnership with Balancer DAO that includes fee split arrangements, a token swap, and veBAL gauges.

**Supplemental Resources:**

* Launch the [Diversified Staked ETH Index](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-launch-the-diversified-staked-eth-index-dseth/4389) (dsETH)
* Fee Split Framework: [Index Coop / Balancer Fee Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K1_AyR0jBxa8_-3yk4FgeawDaCfMplH4VUd1YZ5-0pI/edit?usp=sharing)

**Motivation:**

Since launching over two years ago, Index Coop has established itself as the leader in on-chain structured products. With over 90% of the market share of on-chain indices, we’ve experienced first-hand the many trends and cycles of crypto. Much like the rest of DeFi, Index Coop has yet to reach escape velocity. Our current slate of products offer users one-click access to the largest sectors of crypto. Our strategies make DeFi simple for users who don’t want to constantly manage on-chain positions.

Our DAO, however, has been limited in the type of products we can build. Our upcoming suite of products, built and bundled on Managed Balancer Pools, will unlock the advancements and efficiencies of DeFi in a whole new way. In our new partnership, Index and Balancer are positioned to bring the wonders of crypto to all users. The Index Coop team aims to bring Balancer to every corner of the finance world including institutional custodians, TradFi data providers, crypto intermediaries, DeFi money markets, on-chain aggregators, and wallet interfaces. It is time to bring Balancer to the mainstream.

In an effort to keep our partnership strong and long-term focused - with both of our communities in mind - Index Coop is proposing:

1. Product fee splits
2. OTC token swap
3. Enable veBAL gauges on select products

**Product fee splits**

* Index Coop is offering Balancer DAO a base of 30% of MBP-level fees for Composite MBPs. For Structured MBPs a base MBP-level fee of 50% will go to Balancer.
  * Composite MBPs will resemble existing composite, Set-based products like DPI. Composite MBPs will typically target a theme, sector, or market and generally have simpler functionality.
  * Structured MBPs will represent a new class of products that utilize the fuller feature set of Managed Pools. These structured MBPs will include tokens built in-house by Index Coop and will generally have more sophisticated functionality compared to Composite MBPs.
    * Upcoming dsETH will be considered a Structured MBP
* For a full deep dive into the fee arrangements follow this link: [Index Coop / Balancer Fee Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K1_AyR0jBxa8_-3yk4FgeawDaCfMplH4VUd1YZ5-0pI/edit?usp=sharing)
* Most Favored Nation status: For any fee split arrangement Balancer gives to any party in the future, Index Coop shall have the right (but not the obligation) to receive the same terms.

**Token Swap**

* Index Coop is proposing a 1:1 OTC treasury swap
* 100k INDEX ([currently ~$200k](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0954906da0Bf32d5479e25f46056d22f08464cab)) for a proportional amount of BAL (a 30dma of each token to be applied upon date of formal agreement)
* Index Coop will convert the tokens into veBAL using the vested escrow contract, locking them for 1 year
* We believe in a long-term partnership and propose locking the respective veBAL and INDEX for at least 1 year
* Index Coop will use these tokens to direct BAL rewards to Index Coop Managed Pools beginning with dsETH. These tokens will be supplemented by ~4,824 veBAL (~$80k) obtained by Index Coop treasury investments into the Balancer Boosted USD Pool.
* Voting power for INDEX and BAL is planned to be instant, but is contingent on the technical capaiblites of the locking mechanism

**veBAL Gauges**

* Index Coop is proposing to set up initial gauges for the Diversified Staked ETH Index, Diversified Stable Yield Index, and future Structured MBPs

Over the past few months, we’ve been inspired by the success of BAL and veBAL. We’ve already seen with dsETH how our products could bring positive sum dynamics as protocols can add native token incentives to our products and buy/lock veBAL. The Index Coop team intends to be a major advocate for protocols getting into the veBAL game. While the INDEX token does not share these same characteristics, the INDEX token has unique and powerful metagovernance dynamics. Considering the success of the [Aave swap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-strategic-partnership-with-aave-dao/3031), this partnership would add voting power at a low cost there and also gain voting power in UNI, COMP, and others that we’ve used and can continue to use for asset listings. In addition to the metagovernace power, we invite Balancer DAO to use INDEX tokens to influence the direction of product decisions including the composition of future MBPs.

Index Coop’s first managed pool, dsETH, is only the beginning. Our product team is looking forward to increased flexibility as we build future indices and even as we think about redesigning or bundling existing indices. We believe the combination of our technical teams and our added abilities to distribute tokens to custodians and possibly centralized exchanges will open up Balancer to a whole new class of investors.

**Voting Specifications:**

We request a vote to decide on the partnership between Index Coop and Balancer DAO.

If the community votes YES:

* The product fee arrangement as specified above will be put into place
* Index Coop and Balancer DAO will conduct an OTC token swap. BAL will be sent to the Index Coop Treasury Account: 0x462A63D4405A6462b157341A78Fd1baBfD3F8065
* Initial gauges will be set up for dsETH and DYI

If the community votes NO:

* Index Coop and Balancer teams will revisit our partnership framework without interfering with the technical development of the products

Index Coop and Balancer will continue to work closely together as we build our future slate of products. We look forward to hearing from the entire Balancer Community and we’re happy to answer any questions!",neutral
951,"Hey friends.
i think it's time to go one step forward on our pools and bring multi-rewards pools to the world.
We can have 2 or 3 rewards 
Imagine something like that 
Stake Cake : Earn Cake & Bnb or Stake Cake : Earn Cake / Bnb / Btc.
As we know many ppl sell their cakes for bnb and other high market cap crypto.
we can offer then a chance to farm them while staking Cake.
Feature 1 ) Fixed Staking & 5-10% fee.  fee go to buy cake and burn 
Feature 2 ) To get funds for these pools we will need more games for example
1) prediction  for eth/Btc etc, 50% of losses/fees will be used to buy Cake and burn & 50% will be used to buy for example btc and create the pool
2) ""Crash"" Game, ppl can bet on their preference token, losses and fees will be used like before, buy & burn / buy crypto for pool
3) Margin trading for Bnb/Btc etc, we will use again the same mechanism like prediction game.
That's my idea,  I don't know if possible just brainstorm.
Thx for ur time!",neutral
952,"I have been in Cake since the first week it was launched. I invested when few people knew about it and considered it a joke. Now Pancake swap is the #1 decentralized exchange based on users and volume. The Pancake swap team deserves a huge amount of praise for their efforts for how they have evolved the platform. But its time to evolve again.

Pancake swap has done an incredible job of creating a deflationary token system. It has redefined ICOs and made them safe for everyone. Just a few years ago ICOs were riddled with scams as you had to send your crypto blindly to an address hoping you would get something back. Now all you have to do is hold the Cake token. Major projects like Coin 98, Trust Wallet, Axie Infinity and hundreds more were given to Cake holders just for holding the token. Now EVERY other Dex is trying to copy this model. But the projects they give pale in comparison to what Pancake provides. 

In an effort to reduce Cake inflation they have had to remove rewards for certain LPs. This caused people to remove their liquidity. It's important to note that Pancake did not remove these pools as some would suggest, they just removed the CAKE rewards for them. But there is a reward structure you receive for providing LP, and many LPs pay great rewards in the provided tokens. Few understand this. Instead they say ""Pancake removed our pool"" There are some pools that pay over 100% in fees with no Cake rewards (search for them). 


That said, the FUD of ""Cake removed our pool"" has resulted in less liquidity, and as a result higher fees when swapping many tokens. It's not about the fee that Pancake charges, that's still one of the lowest in the industry, rather its the PRICE IMPACT. If there isn't enough liquidity you can pay over 5% in some cases. But becuase the pool isn't incentivized enough people aren't providing liquidity to reduce the price impact.  You can't have an efficient exchange without people providing liquidity. This is a problem for ALL decentralized exchanges. Not just Pancake Swap.

SOLUTION

1. Stop Cake emissions. 

The Cake reward structure was devised at a time when no one knew how big DEFI would become. Cake has grown bigger than anyone could have imagined. The old Cake reward structure no longer works for the future. There is however a fantastic deflationary mechanism in place. Cake would continued to be burned by these mechanisms. Cake would also still be used in IFOs and governance and voting. You also MUST own a minimum amount of Cake just for using the platform. There are too many people using the platform that dont own Cake. 

2. Create a New Reward Token.

This token will be used to incentivize LPs longterm. Rewards would never be removed from the LPs. The only way you would receive this token is by having Cake. The reward token could be incentivized in other ways. The team knows how to create deflationary models to keep the price stable. 

3. Replace many of the BNB LPs with Cake. 

BNB has many deflationary mechanisms in place and no one can use BSC without BNB. But again we're giving away too much Cake to non Cake holders. 

4. Increase the fees to providers. 

0.17% to providers is not enough. This needs to be at least 0.3 or higher. This means the total fee needs to be at least 0.43% to continue to burn Cake at the same rate. Although with NO inflation, we dont need to burn Cake at the same rate. If this seems high to you...you're wrong. With stock brokerages it is typical to pay over 1% in fees for transactions. Forex the lowest fee you pay on the most liquid pairs is 1.2%
Even Coinbase charges almost 2% on exchanges. They do this by manipulating their exchange price vs the real price. 

In reality in most cases you are paying more than 0.43% because of the price impact. If your price impact is 0.3% that means your TOTAL fee is 0.6% 0.3% is a VERY LOW price impact but thats still higher than it should be. If we all provide enough liquidity then we can get the price impact on ALL pairs to less than 0.1%

The exchange then becomes more efficient. Which is what we all want.",bearish

Proposal to get approval from the Aave community to adjust the governance requirements (proposition power, quorum vote differential) for Level 2 proposals, affecting the most critical components of the Aave ecosystem.
This is highly recommended from the BGD point of view, as those requirements were defined back in the days when the AAVE fragmentation was different, and because this could create an artificial and self-imposed bottleneck to pass proposals which should not really have opposition, given their technical nature.

## Detailed explanation and community discussion
https://governance.aave.com/t/rfc-aave-governance-adjust-level-2-requirements-long-executor/8693

## Requirements of this Snapshot
Given the importance of this proposal, we think a minimum of 250k FOR support is required before passing to the on-chain steps.
The Snapshot will be open for an extended period of 7 days.",neutral
955,"## Goal of the Vote

This snapshot vote is to gather community sentiment toward reallocating the inactive voting power that was initially delegated during the Bootstrap Delegate initiative evenly across the self-nominated community members.

*Note that this proposal is a variation of the original experiment proposed in the governance forum in two ways that are described below.*

## Scope

The forum post on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549).

In summary, the goal of the proposed experiment is to reactivate inactive voting power in response to the drop in overall voting participation over the past 18 months by empowering new community members.

Over the past week, 7 community members have self-nominated themselves to be considered for the reallocated voting power. Below is an alphabetized list of them linked to their self-nomination:

* [Aishwary](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/4)
* [Celo](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/12)
* [Daniel](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/8)
* [GFX Labs](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/5)
* [Flipside Crypto](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/2)
* [Koppany](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/13)
* [Patrick](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/3)

If this vote is successful, the 3M cumulative voting power that was initially delegated to SonOfPegasus and DeFi Saver will be evenly reallocated across these 7 new community members. 

As noted in the top of this vote description, this proposal differs from the original one presented in the governance forum in both process and outcome.  
* (1) instead of 2 snapshot votes, one to measure sentiment around reallocating inactive voting power and one to indicate support for individuals to receive that reallocation, the variation is 1 snapshot vote to measure sentiment to reallocate inactive voting power to all self-nominated community members;
* (2) instead of reallocating to 3 new members, the variation is to reallocate to all 7 self-nominated members.

**Given that the goal was to increase the number of individuals/groups participating in governance, I believe that these changes are appropriate and do not introduce any significant deviation.**

If this vote passes, there will also be one more snapshot vote to measure community sentiment for delegate compensation which is the second component of the proposed experiment.

##### ABSTRACT
1. $75K for 2.5% equity to the DAO = $3M Valuation
2. 10,000 DAO Dark Lager free for $APE holders
3. +10,000 Cans of Beer for 10 Communities irl events (10 $APE holder independent panel who will decide which events get the beer) + Feld, Quit, Pieter, David & Gene
* We have brewing capacity and the ability to deliver to events in Asia, UK, Canada, and the US
4. $APE Gamified Educational Platform
5. Boring Brewery Clubhouse/Taproom IRL in 2024
6. Otherside and others (such as Faraway) Assets for Yuga Labs Gaming


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
1. We will work with the DAO and legal to give 2.5% equity to the DAO. This first of its kind give back will usher in the next wave of AIP’s and set the stage for true value creation within the DAO amplified by the marketing impact through branding, education and culture driven social content and sharing. By taking this on, Bored Brewing will lay the difficult, but exciting groundwork for giving back to the DAO.
2. We will be spreading knowledge about $APE to less crypto native people who enjoy drinking beer. We believe that $APE can become a currency for the digital revolution and we want to be a small part of spreading the name to a demographic thirsty for this type of knowledge outside of the crypto community.
3. We will sponsor partnered events and share the ApeCoin brand across other relevant crypto/nft communities. The goal is to market the coin and share the background and goals of the DAO for the future.


##### OVERALL COST 
149,696 $APE

- Approx 50K $APE - $75K USD in exchange for 2.5% equity utilizing the SAFE agreement mentioned above.

- 40K $APE for 20,000 (approx $3/can including shipping) Cans of Beer. Designed, recipe developed, partnered with, produced and project managed to deliver Globally.

- 10K $APE towards skins and assets for Metaverse, Gaming, and ODK activations.

- 15K $APE towards software development, design, testing, and deployment of the $APE gamified educational platform for ApeCoin (<50% of the total cost/budget).

- 20K $APE towards the IRL Clubhouse/Taproom build out (<25% of the total budget).

- 5K $APE for technology integration and distribution setup for direct to consumer shipping

- 9,696 $APE for marketing, comms, project management, and graphic design/assets for promotion of each activation and partnership as well as content creation for each of the deliverables.

title: [TEMP CHECK] stEUR Onboarding on Aave V3 Ethereum Pool
author: @marczeller - Aave-chan Initiative
date: 09-10-2023
---

## Summary

This TEMP CHECK proposes the onboarding of stEUR as a collateral-only asset on the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool. stEUR represents staked agEUR, a decentralized EUR-peg stablecoin minted by the Angle Protocol.

## Motivation

- **Decentralized Stablecoin Diversity**: At the ACI, we support the diversity of decentralized stablecoins. EUR stablecoins, in particular, are underrepresented in the ecosystem, and onboarding stEUR can help bridge this gap.
  
- **Growth in a Controlled Environment**: While stEUR and agEUR have relatively small market caps (5M$ and 20M$ respectively), onboarding stEUR as a collateral-only asset with limited caps will allow it to grow in a controlled environment, minimizing risks for the Aave protocol.

- **Collateral Potential**: stEUR, being a staked version of a decentralized EUR-peg stablecoin, presents a promising collateral candidate for Aave.

## Specification

- **Asset**: stEUR
- **Contract Address**: 0x004626A008B1aCdC4c74ab51644093b155e59A23

### Price Feed

For the price feed, we propose implementing a price adapter that calculates the value of stEUR based on the value of agEUR/USD and the exchange rate of agEUR/stEUR.

This replicates precedents such as with [sDAI](https://etherscan.io/address/0x29081f7aB5a644716EfcDC10D5c926c5fEe9F72B#code).

### Risk Parameters

We propose the following parameters for stEUR onboarding:

| Parameter             | Value       |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Isolation Mode        | No          |
| Borrowable            | No          |
| Borrowable in Iso     | No          |
| Stable Borrowing      | No          |
| Collateral Enabled    | Yes         |
| Supply Cap (stEUR)    | 3,000,000   |
| Borrow Cap (stEUR)    | 0           |
| Debt Ceiling          | N/A         |
| LTV                   | 70%         |
| LT                    | 75%         |
| LB                    | 8%          |
| LPF                   | 10%         |
| Reserve Factor        | 20%         |
| Base Rate             | 0%          |
| Slope 1               | 8%          |
| Slope 2               | 80%         |
| Optimal Ratio         | 80%         |

## Next Steps

1. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.
4. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provided feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
5. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

961,"*Polls and feedback were focused on the PancakeSquad community, but the ""Make Offer"" Button will be beneficial for all NFTs on the PancakeSwap NFT Marketplace.

3 reasons for to implement the ""Make Offer"" Button

(1) It's what the community wants.  A recent poll on Pancake Squad BSC Telegram Group and PancakeSquadBSC Twitter both show an overwhelming support for the ""Make Offer"" Button.  There are many times that there is a NFT that we would like to buy, but the seller has not listed it for sale or put an unrealistic sale price and there is no direct way to communicate between the seller and buyer.

(2) PancakeSquad sales will increase which will burn more $Cake.  Enabling the community to make offers and having more options and activity in the Marketplace will naturally lead to more sales.

(3) PancakeSquad Floor Price and overall Prices will increase which will burn more $Cake.  Compared to other top NFT projects, the number of PancakeSquads listed for sale in the marketplace is extremely high.  We are over 20% while other projects are all under 10%.  From the data we have been collecting, when the Squads listed for sale dropped from 25% to 24%, there was corresponding increase in the floor price from 3.6 BNB to 4.6 BNB.  The best way to get Squads off the Marketplace is to have an offer button.  The community will ""Delist"" their squads becuase the ""Make Offer"" button will still make it available and open to offers.",bullish

## Summary

This proposal aims to initiate the offboarding process for TUSD from the Aave V2 Ethereum pool. The process will follow a similar process as the [BUSD offboarding plan part I](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-busd-offboarding-plan/12170).

*Gauntlet does not quantify risk associated with centralized stablecoins and regulatory concerns. In light of this, we provide this framework with ACI to the community to gauge preference and thoughts around further TUSD deprecation.* 

## Motivation
TUSD has been a historic asset of the Aave ecosystem, but due to recent events, the ACI suggests consideration of its offboarding. The offboarding plan leverages the previous success of the BUSD offboarding plan and will incentive current users to slowly migrate their positions to other stablecoins on Aave.


Previous proposals have [frozen TUSD](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/253/) and [lowered TUSD LT to 77.5%. ](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/256/) These proposals have reduced TUSD borrow and supply over the past 30 days, from 20M supplied and 18M borrowed, to 13.1M supplied and 6.8M borrowed today.

## Specification

The following table outlines the proposed changes to the TUSD risk parameters:

| Parameter                | Current Value | Proposed Value |
|--------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| LTV                      | 75%           | 0%             |
| Liquidation Bonus        | 5%            | 10%            |
| Reserve Factor           | 25%           | 95%            |
| Borrowing Enabled        | Yes           | No             |
| Stable Borrowing Enabled | Yes           | No             |

### [ARFC-Addendum]  Update Boosters & diluters for Merit Round 2

### Author:  @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

### Date: 2024-04-03

---

### **Simple Summary**

This ARFC-Addendum proposes to make booster & diluters evolve inside Merit to adapt to the DeFi ecosystem landscape evolution, introducing new diluters & removing a booster action.

## Motivation

Merit wETH has been a clear success with nearly 200k ETH, leaving other protocols to join Aave V3. 160k ETH specifically left Morpho V3 to join aave, forcing a re-balance, and has made Morpho the second largest borrower & fee payer (>11%) of wETH in Aave, forcing them to pay north of 1600 ETH to the aave DAO per year.

https://etherscan.io/token/0xeA51d7853EEFb32b6ee06b1C12E6dcCA88Be0fFE#balances

Merit GHO has also been a success and reinforced our Safety module (17M$), secondary liquidity, and peg. It allows the DAO to restart GHO minting while keeping the peg in check.

GHO is expected to provide 10% of all DAO overall revenue by next week.

However, we have to witness less collaborative behavior from some ecosystem actors. In light of this, it seems suboptimal for the Aave DAO to reward uncollaborative protocols & behaviors.

This is why we suggest stopping any subsidies to the makerDAO ecosystem; the Aave DAO has already paid millions via the AAVE and third-party LM programs and has been repaid by creating competitive forks and activating D3M in a protocol that has stolen millions of revenue from this DAO with no safety track record using a market sensible collateral.

With this proposal, a single $ in Morpho Blue or Spark will nullify any Merit Airdrop for the user.
sDAI is considered a makerDAO product, not a Spark product; holding simply sDAI or having it in Aave will not dilute a user.

This proposal aims to be enabled for Merit Round 2 and all subsequent rounds.

## Specification

### Proposed Changes:

### Conservative Option

1. Remove ""MakerDAO fren"" Boosters. for the usage of sDAI as collateral

### Aggresive Option

1. Remove ""MakerDAO fren"" Boosters. for the usage of sDAI as collateral
2. Include Morpho Blue & Spark users in the ""User of Non-Aligned Protocol"" diluter.

## Next Steps

1. If this proposal reaches a consensus on Snapshot, update the Merit reward system accordingly

This proposal is made independently by the ACI.

971,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/hexagon-friendly-fork-proposal/2613).

**Background**

The Friendly Fork model (aka Franchise model) was first introduced by @followthechain in this [post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-on-other-chains-friendly-forks-aka-franchise-model/2279).

The general reasoning behind the proposal was to make the Balancer technology available on chains where Balancer.fi was not present and to avoid an increase in workload by the Balancer Labs core team.

The FF model, at the moment, has only been applied on one occasion with the approval of [Beethovenx](https://beets.fi/#/) through this [snapshot vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x95db8e797145ad590b467f8dbecb23404c25c2a7090aa8a8d65428ad9f7373fc).

The extraordinary [success](https://twitter.com/beethoven_x/status/1503647503698247680) that ""Beets"" has achieved to date, has created an appetite for the recreation of a similar model that could use the same superior technology (the Balancer technology), but with a different, own identity adapted to the market intended to enter.

**Motivation**

Current market conditions show a consistent increase in trading activity on Avalanche, which has demonstrated to be one of the most active and vibrant communities in the DeFi landscape. The strategic decision of the Balancer team not to deploy on this chain has pushed the Partnership subDAO towards the exploration of possible valid alternatives with the intention of recreating, at least partially, the success of BeethovenX.

Launching a Friendly Fork by the DAO however, proved to be a complex exercise with mainly three factors that strongly influenced the decision making process:

1. Team: finding a team that is able to develop, maintain and dedicate resources to the project;
2. Chain: current market conditions present two options:
--> develop a product on a highly competitive and possibly saturated chain or
--> be a first mover on ""nascent"" chains with the associated risk of not being relevant and wasting resources;

3. Liquidity: how to bootstrap decent liquidity from day one (critical factor).

To minimise these risks, the Partnership subDAO believed in the creation of a “hub”, by deeply concentrating synergies with experienced players in the DeFi ecosystem and building a joint project.

**Introducing Hexagon Finance**

Hexagon will be a multi-functional platform, with the intention of intercepting the different needs of the Avalanche crypto Community by bringing a new decentralized exchange, a launch-pad and a lending platform.

*Ava Labs blessing*: A critical role has been played by Ava Labs which has operated as an important bridge between the later to be named Hexagon team and BalancerDAO.

Moreover, Avalabs has committed some initial funds specifically dedicated to the Liquidity Mining program. This will help for the bootstrapping of liquidity and attracting fresh capital from competing chains.

*Terra Labs Partnership*: Hexagon Finance will be mainly focused on UST, the algo stable coin of Terra, with the ultimate goal of making it the most used and widely distributed stable-coin on Avalanche.

TerraLabs will join the project by being a major stakeholder together with BalancerDAO and the founding team. Terralabs has committed for an initial capital deployment (UST) to help the project building the initial phase of liquidity bootstrapping.

The launchpad functionality will be developed by Copperlaunch, a long term partner of Balancer.

**Specification**

The agreement between Hexagon Finance and BalancerDAO has been built around a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which will be signed by a BalancerDAO representative if this proposal is accepted.

General conditions are the following:
BalancerDAO is requesting the following

*1. Governance*

* The community on the host chain fully supports the fork development;
* Teams should adhere to a level of code of conduct that is in line with the core values of the Balancer community.

*2. Technical*

*   1. Balancer V2 core contracts should be deployed without any changes, (Contracts deployed 1:1)
*   2. No migration functionality in the MasterChef;
*   3. All controllable protocol parameters need to be managed by reputable multisig.

*3. Financial*

Hexagon Finance undertakes to provide Balancer with as many tokens as the Hexagon team. Tokens will be received under the same conditions in terms of vesting and release. This means 6% of the total supply, or 6 million tokens out of 100,000,000, whose release will be locked for 6 months upon launch and linearly vested for 12 to 24 months. The exact length of time will be finalized upon the completion of the private sale round, if any.

The tokens will be claimable using an address chosen by Balancer.

In exchange for the above conditions, Hexagon requires Balancer to engage mainly in Marketing activities and awareness campaigns as detailed below:

* Tweeting original content about Hexagon Finance for the four weeks prior to our launch and for the two months following it. The tweet will come from the BalancerDAO handle.

* Creating and publishing announcements regarding the activities of Hexagon Finance. This will cover every major activity such as, but not limited to, airdrops, launches, new pools being created and products being launched.

* Organizing Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions with the Balancer community to promote the launch of Hexagon and eventual upgrades/news afterward. At a minimum, this will include an AMA shortly before or after the launch of the Hexagon Dex.

* Hexagon Finance is authorized to use the name and logo of Balancer in its official documents in statements with pre-approval on logo usage from BalancerDAO such as “the officially approved fork of Balancer on Avalanche” and similar;

* Providing statements from official representatives of BalancerDAO in support of Hexagon to influencers, media outlets, and similar. This will include both written and audio statements as required by the channel used (articles, video, podcasts etc.). At least one statement should be shared before the launch of the platform.

* In general, making it clear to the Balancer community that Hexagon is an officially approved fork of the Balancer Protocol on Avalanche.

**Tokenomics**

Token allocation will be distributed as follow:
|18%|Team - BalancerDAO - Terra Labs|
| --- | --- |
|5%|Strategy investors|
|2%|Liquidity bootstrapping|
|10%|Marketing|
|10%|Partners and Advisors|
|55%|Liquidity Mining incentives|

**SWOT Analysis**

*Strengths*

The Partnership subDAO believes that the blessing of Avalabs, the partnership with Terralabs and the reliability of the funding team are the main points of strength. The Avalanche ecosystem is already highly competitive so risk mitigations strategies have been considered necessary for the development of Hexagon Finance;

*Weaknesses*

* Making UST as the main focal point can be a double edged sword for two reasons:

1. focussing on one stable coin creates an overexposure that some would consider unnecessary in terms of point of failure;
2. the general missing of potential trading volume on alternative pairs.

* While the BeethovenX Friendly Fork agreement has been reached after launch, in this case, the agreement should be reached before. Consequently bringing a certain level of uncertainty. However, the Partnership subDAO believes that risks have been reduced considerably given the deep due diligence done on the team and the partners involved in this collaboration.

The DeFi landscape is still in its early stages and layers of uncertainty are very much present, especially in today’s market conditions. A constantly evolving market generates certain known unknowns and a level of unpredictability that needs to be taken into account when operating in cutting edge environments.

*Opportunities*

The BalancerDAO will finally have the opportunity to have a stake in a project with strong backing, good fundamentals and exposure to a strategic chain. This is, today, the best opportunity we see for a successful Balancer powered Dex on Avalanche.

*Threats*

Competition is high! Even if Hexagon would focus mainly on UST trading pairs, more established and long term native players still control the vast majority of the market.

Conclusion

We present this as a great opportunity to the Balancer Community. Hexagon will ultimately increase the number of independent teams working and using the Balancer technology. This project will also increase the number of developers working on the protocol, give precious feedback to the Balancer core team and ultimately, inspire us all to do better. Similar to what Beethoven has been doing during the past few months.

I hope this presentation gives you enough context to where we have been, where we are, and where we want to go: up only.

*For full disclosure:*
*The Hexagon team has offered Andrea a token allocation equal to the 0,0012% of the total token supply as a thank you gesture.*",neutral
972,"### [PR with Payloads](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/263)

### Motivation

Balancer contributors have recently been exploring ways to increase non-toxic flow through the protocol. In the wake of BIP-295’s approval discussions have been in progress with 1inch to bring this discount to 1inch Fusion. This would be done by granting the role for calling `setSwapFeePercentage` to the 1inch Labs settlement contract - then they would pass in interactions which lower the fee on the pool, execute the swap, then return the fee to the previous value. The swap fee could be lowered in this manner by up to 80% to enable a significant increase in “good flow” to Balancer pools.

Since Fusion is also available on L2’s we can extend this discount to Arbitrum and Polygon as well.

Most of Balancer’s protocol fees are generated from yield rather than swaps. There is a chance this proposal leads to more swap fees but even if it does not, one of the most important goals for the Balancer ecosystem is to grow our DEX volume market share. This is likely one of the best chances we have to move the needle on that.

### Risks

The Maxis will retain the ability to call `setSwapFeePercentage` on all pool factories so if something unexpected happens and fees are dramatically lowered or raised globally by accident it can be fixed very quickly by the Maxis. Governance can also revoke this role at any time in the future through a future BIP.

**Summary**

Stader proposes adding a gauge for the Matic<>MaticX pool on Balancer. MaticX is a liquid token for Matic staking built by StaderLabs, a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider with ~770 mn $ in TVL. The incentivization of the Matic<>MaticX pool on Balancer will help:

1. Build deep liquidity would be a prerequisite to make staked Matic truly liquid in the Polygon Defi ecosystem and incentives would be an important mechanism to aid this
2. Establish Balancer as the prime DEX for Matic <> MaticX pool. Two reasons why this is important:
  1. $3 bn in assets locked in polygon staking currently that is set to be unlocked by liquid staking solutions like MaticX
  2. With its metastable pool technology, Balancer is best placed to serve Matic <> MaticX

* Website: https://staderlabs.com/

**Protocol description**

*Background on Staderlabs:*

StaderLabs is a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider. We are live on 4 blockchains including Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera.

Within a few months of launch, Stader has more than 770 Mn USD of total assets staking on the platform.

1. ~ $700 M+ Luna staked
2. ~$60 M+ HBAR staked
3. Over 40k+ users staking with Stader smart contracts

Stader Protocol’s native token is the SD Token, and we have incentivized liquidity pools on other DEXes by giving out rewards in SD tokens (listed on coin gecko). 

*About MaticX:*

MaticX is a liquid token that users get when they stake their Matic with Stader. The MaticX tokens are a representation of users’ staked Matic. They allow users to swap them at a later date for their staked Matic and accrued rewards with Stader. Meanwhile, they will be able to use it on multiple protocols on Polygon to participate in DeFi. MaticX is an ERC20 token.

Safety and security are paramount for Stader and we do multiple audits of our smart contracts to safeguard user’s funds. MaticX contracts have been audited successfully by two reputed audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes. 

**Motivation**

Adding incentivization to the Matic<>MaticX pool on Balancer will help unlock the large liquidity currently locked in staked Matic for the Polygon and Balancer community and in the process, bring significant liquidity and trading volumes to the Balancer ecosystem

* Liquid staking is large and MaticX aims to be the primary liquid staking token for Polygon:
  * Staking on polygon currently has ~3bn $ of assets staked. Liquid staking can help unlock a large part of this for use in the Defi ecosystem making this an asset class of interest to the Polygon and Balancer communities
  * Stader’s experience in building strong liquid staking solutions on multiple chains, especially Terra and Hedera, with ~770 mn$ in TVL makes it one of the leading candidates to help unlock this liquidity through MaticX
  * MaticX is off to a strong start within a few weeks of launch with staking TVL for Matic already at 2.5+ Million Matic. We also recently launched staking on the Polygon Mainnet directly (Polygon's staking protocol is native to Ethereum, so Stader Polygon v1 only supported staking Matic on Ethereum) and this will help increase staking penetration and in turn, MaticX
  * We will build deep liquidity for MaticX to truly enable users to unlock their staked assets and participate in Defi on Polygon. The MaticX <> Matic LP is already live on Quickswap and has a liquidity of around 5 million USD with average daily trading volume of $246,333 in the last 7 days (Apr 27-May 3)
  * We expect MaticX to continue to grow in demand as we integrate across more ecosystem partners and also increase overall staking participation in Polygon (currently only 14,000 wallets of total of 140m active wallets stake on Polygon)
* Balancer is best suited to provide deep liquidity for Matic<>MaticX given its unique metastable pool technology, a great fit for liquid staking assets

979,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-increasing-flexibility-of-liquidity-mining-program/2446).


**Background**

It has been roughly 8 months since the original liquidity mining [framework](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmeCrSe5xL5YWB17TjxAofYi3QnBMyHCYqufD8t3Zonj4S) was officialy set into motion. The structure that the program put into place was necessary at the time since the liquidity mining committee was just being formed. However its tiered system is very rigid and that rigidity causes some inherent challenges when it comes to divvying up liquidity across many pools with varying TVL.

The liquidity mining committee and business development teams have been working hard to onboard new strategic partners. Due to this influx of new projects it is becoming increasingly difficult to allocate incentives to new pools without impacting other pools in a meaningful way. This is due to the sizable changes in BAL between tiers. We’ve seen over the past few months that smaller incentive changes lead to better pool retention. As a reminder these are the existing tiers:

Tier 1: 15,000 BAL (4 slots, total of 60k BAL per week)
Tier 2: 5,000 BAL (9 slots, total of 45k BAL per week)
Tier 3: 2,500 BAL (12 slots, total of 30k BAL per week)
Tier 4: 1,000 BAL (10 slots, total of 10k BAL per week)

As you can see above it is a ~70% drop from Tier 1 to Tier 2, 50% drop from Tier 2 to Tier 3, and a 60% drop from Tier 3 to Tier 4. Current setup constraints in BAL allocation do not allow an efficient incentive model for prospective partners of numerous sizes.

As you may remember there were already two governance votes to switch to a more flexible model, those decisions proved to be successful and allowed the Liquidity Mining Committee to tailor specific allocations to projects depending on pool sizes:

* Introduction of Tier 4 to add flexibility ([link](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmWiYnwdDynSJ66rt949E5nifh3CtYX6zYxTviiFMbXu3R))
* Moving Polygon to a fully flexible allocation model ([link](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmQiatrqfsNZ4eSPCwBwaujBujwzhu2QqHEBSHqEoXs8g5))

This proposal moves even further in that direction by giving the Liquidity Mining Committee additional flexibility on both Main Net and Arbitrum.


**Proposal**

* Keep Tier 1 in place (no changes), any changes to pools in this tier would still require a governance vote.
* Dissolve Tier 2, 3, and 4 distribution model on Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum and move to the flexible allocation model that exists on Polygon today. This change will provide the liquidity committee flexibility to allocate the 41,500 BAL ($726,000) on Ethereum mainnet and 8,500 BAL ($148,000) on Arbiturm.

This increased flexibility will allow the Liquidity Mining Committee to “right size” the incentives for respective pools. This change will ultimately lead to a better BAL per TVL allocation and spread liquidity across many places.

As a real world example let’s take a look at the LINK/WETH pool that is currently allocated 2,500 BAL. If the Liquidity Committee felt that the BAL allocation was better served elsewhere the pool would be cut by 1,500 BAL if dropped to the next tier. The APR for that pool would drop from ~12% to ~5%. Instead, what if you could trim the BAL by 200, 300, 500, etc. This freedom of flexibility will empower the Liquidity Committee with the ability to “spread the wealth” across our many partners. This change will also allow the Balancer platform to take a step towards a Curve gauge like system in the future if that is ultimately a desire of the community.

There are no suggested incentive changes for any pools as part of this proposal.


**Risks**

We see no greater risk that Liquidity Committee members could mis-manage rewards than they could with the current structure.

Governance would continue to have the power to halt the powers of the committee at any time, or remove members from the committee if it deemed such an action appropriate. The need for committee votes to pass changes each week would provide several days for governance to intervene, were such an intervention deemed necessary.",neutral

# **Summary**

PoundToken’s mission is to be the fully regulated GBP stablecoin of choice that allows for a true 24/7 real-time settlement and we are excited to have the opportunity to have the Balancer community be a part of this journey.

PoundToken is the first regulated issuer of a fully cash collateralized stable token called GBPT that comes with independent Proof of Reserves out of the gate. Every GBPT token is fully FIAT backed by 1 GBP in our bank account.

Our vision is to enable both retail consumers and financial institutions to leverage the power of GBP within the DeFi space and beyond. We are looking to Balancer as a great entry point into the arena and are excited to be offering exclusive incentives for those looking to help PoundToken in this initial distribution phase.

PoundToken is planning to set up a GBPT:USDC FX Pool that will enable liquidity providers to earn BAL Emissions as well as a starting 2% yield on all GBPT that is provisioned into the pool.

# **Protocol Description**

PoundToken has primarily been used OTC and listed on CEXs such as gate.io. We are now however looking to leverage Xave’s FXPool to enable an accurate stablecoin exchange between GBPT & USDC for the Balancer DAO and its community.

# **Motivation**

PoundToken will continue to build use cases for this pool to encourage more liquid FX trades. We are looking to distribute GBPT further into the Ethereum ecosystem while at the same time starting to scale out our offering to multiple L2s so that we can issue natively on them.

A great use case we are already exploring is enabling local UK based companies that are typically taking payments or receiving investments in USDC right now to be able to swap into GBPT to reduce their FX exposure. This pool would play a pivotal role in enabling this.

# **Specifications**

1. **Governance:** 
Governance of the pool will be done via snapshot for now.

2. **Oracles:**
By leveraging Xave’s FXPools the GBPT:USDC pair will utilize a Chainlink oracle to allow FX accurate swaps for a predetermined range of the bonding curve. Beyond this range (called the “beta region”), LP ratio then dictates the price of trades. At this point, arbitrageurs are incentivized by significantly cheaper fees to trade the pool back to the “beta region” where FX price is followed. LPs are also incentivized to keep liquidity in the pool especially while it is outside the “beta region”, due to existing parameters that yield much higher fees charged to traders swapping the pool away from the “beta region”.

3. **Audits:**
https://resources.poundtoken.io/tech-audits/
https://docs.xave.co/contract-audits/fxpool-final-audit

4. **Centralization vectors:**
3/3 operations multisig that owns contracts until contracts are “battle tested” and community is ready to takeover. The owner of the pool will be changed to the Balancer recommended address 0xbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalb once the pool has been running for sometime without issue to allow for quick response time in the event of an emergency. Until then the Xave operations multisig will be assigned as the pool’s owner.

5. **Market History:** 
GBPT is an asset backed stablecoin, fully collateralized and issued by BlackFridge - the licensed issuer of fiat backed stablecoin GBPT. USDC is an asset backed stablecoin issued by Circle

6. **Value:**
FXPools deployed on Xave are highly capital efficient allowing for the pool to support larger trade volumes despite the minimal liquidity.
