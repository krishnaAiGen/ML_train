## Rationale:

This proposal seeks to deploy a 1bp fee tier for UniswapV3 on Arbitrum. This will allow users to trade with lower fees, making it more accessible and competitive with other decentralized exchanges. The optionality of a 1bp fee tier is useful for stable-to-stable swapping and can often be found among the top ten liquidity pools on each of Uniswap’s respective deployments. 

Since the launch of the 1bp fee tier on mainnet, [Polygon](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/polygon-1bp-fee-tier/16488), and [Optimism](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-a-1bp-fee-tier-to-uniswapv3-on-optimism/16930), the 1bp fee tier has directly led to growth in Uniswap’s DEX market share and directly competes with stablecoin DEX protocols.

Benefits:
* Lower fee tiers increase competitiveness and incentivize more user activity.
* As liquidity is more concentrated, 1bp pools are more capital efficient, especially for stable-to-stable swaps.
* Lower fee tiers can also lead to increased volume and earnings for liquidity providers.
## Why Arbitrum:
Favorable outcomes from deploying the 1bp fee tier on all other existing Uniswap v3 deployments make this an uncontroversial upgrade of the Arbitrum deployment.

Arbitrum has a thriving ecosystem of DeFi dapps that will benefit from less stable-to-stable friction. The Uniswap deployment on Arbitrum currently has [~200M of TVL and ~160M of volume](https://info.uniswap.org/#/arbitrum/). With Curve’s liquidity bribing mechanism losing efficiency, Uniswap is in a strong position to compete for traders’ flow and LPs’ liquidity by providing more competitive fee tiers.

2,"##### ABSTRACT
“ApeCoin Presents First Friday: Bridging Communities, Creativity, and Governance” encapsulates an unprecedented partnership that signifies more than ApeCoin becoming the presenting sponsor for First Friday events in Las Vegas. We have the opportunity to place ApeCoin at the heart of a cultural gathering that attracts 15,000-20,000 visitors on average, offering unparalleled exposure and the access to creative collaborations within a community rich in art and innovation. This is a six month deal that will run from July-December of 2024, the prime time for this event. We also will be given the opportunity to renew on a longer term basis after this initial six months is completed.

It heralds a holistic collaboration aimed at enhancing ApeCoin’s visibility and embedding it deeply within the local cultural and artistic milieu. This partnership is a strategic alliance, underscoring a commitment to support communities that resonate with creativity, innovation, and progressive governance. By integrating ApeCoin into these seminal community events, we’re not only expanding our reach but also aligning seamlessly with our core mission to foster an ecosystem where technology and creativity intersect harmoniously. “ApeCoin Presents First Friday” is set to celebrate the fusion of digital innovation with the arts, setting a precedent for the role of Web3 in cultural and community engagement.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
This partnership extends beyond mere sponsorship, bringing multifaceted benefits to the ApeCoin ecosystem, the city of Las Vegas, and its governance framework:

Amplified Brand Exposure and Community Engagement: As the presenting sponsor, ApeCoin secures prime visibility across all First Friday communications, including official banners prominently displayed throughout the event, mentions in press releases, and a dedicated section on the First Friday website with a hyperlink to ApeCoin’s platform. This comprehensive exposure ensures ApeCoin’s presence is palpable, reaching an expansive audience of artists, enthusiasts, and city dwellers.

Dedicated Space for ApeCoin and Web3 Exploration: Perhaps the most significant advantage of this partnership is the allocation of a large, dedicated area at each First Friday event. This space will serve as the epicenter for presenting ApeCoin and its array of AIP-approved projects. It’s an opportunity to engage the community directly, showcase the practical applications of ApeCoin, and provide a tangible experience of the possibilities within the Web3 ecosystem. This space also allows us to bring in a swath of presenters, who can use our space to showcase their own aligned initiatives, whether that be web3 driven projects or local initiatives.

Strengthened City and Government Relations: The partnership positions ApeCoin as a cultural and economic contributor to Las Vegas, fostering positive engagements with local government and policy makers. This proactive involvement aims to solidify Web3’s role in the city’s future, advocating for a regulatory environment that champions digital innovation.

Foundation for Additional Local Partnerships: Engaging with First Friday opens the door to numerous collaborations within the Las Vegas community, from cultural institutions to technology innovators. These partnerships will be instrumental in solidifying ApeCoin’s presence and influence in the local ecosystem, driving broader acceptance and integration of Web3 technologies.

Catalyst for Web3-Friendly City Development: Beyond immediate brand visibility, this initiative embodies ApeCoin’s commitment to embedding digital currencies within the social and economic fabric of Las Vegas. By demonstrating the value of ApeCoin through community-centric events, we pave the way for Las Vegas to emerge as a beacon for blockchain and digital currencies, inspiring other cities to explore similar collaborations.

Exclusive Benefits as Presenting Sponsor: The array of exclusive benefits, including creative control over the dedicated area, input on featured content and activities, and the ability to highlight ApeCoin’s contributions to the Web3 community, underscores the strategic value of this partnership. It provides a dynamic platform for engaging with a diverse audience, educating them on the benefits of digital currencies, and showcasing the tangible impacts of ApeCoin and its projects on the local community.

In sum, “ApeCoin Presents First Friday” is a landmark initiative that transcends traditional sponsorship. It’s a comprehensive strategy aimed at fostering long-term engagement with the Las Vegas community, promoting the adoption of Web3 technologies, and establishing ApeCoin as a pivotal force in the cultural, economic, and governance landscapes of Las Vegas. Through this partnership, we envision a future where ApeCoin is integral to the city’s vibrant cultural scene, supported by a governance framework that embraces the transformative potential of digital currencies.

Sponsorship Details As the Presenting Sponsor for First Friday, ApeCoin commits to a dynamic and multifaceted involvement, both in terms of what we provide and facilitate. This sponsorship is tailored to leverage ApeCoin’s unique position within the Web3 ecosystem, offering a blend of technological innovation and community engagement at one of Las Vegas’s most anticipated monthly cultural events. Here’s a detailed breakdown of our contributions and facilitations:

title: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
created: 2024-02-29

---

# Summary

This publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee with 500k GHO to continue supporting GHO's liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next 3 months.

# Motivation

Since its initial [funding in October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/343/), the Aave Liquidity Committee (previously GLC) has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes by deploying and incentivising liquidity pools.
 
As a result of these efforts:

* Deeper on-chain liquidity
* Lower slippage, especially for GHO to USDC swaps

In combination with other efforts like stkGHO, ALC's initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHO's peg recovery.

Throughout the period, the ALC leveraged on both Uniswap v3 and, more frequently, Maverick to tailor liquidity distribution at specific price ranges which helped absorb GHO downward market volatility. A list of active Boosted Positions can be found [here](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions?chain=1).

While some pools are incentivised by voting with pre-existing DAO holdings (e.g. vlAURA), others like Maverick's concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses. It is worth noting, the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick. We expect Maverick, and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3, to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience.

Concentrated GHO liquidity was [recently introduced in Balancer](https://twitter.com/GyroStable/status/1757365157917815001) with the creation of several E-CLP pools. These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAO's vlAURA holding. When there is excess vlAURA votes, these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70% APR nominated in USDC. 

The following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHO's ecosystem, highlights:

* GHO/USDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume 
    * 0.2% bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period
    * 0.1% bin width pool is starting to replace the 0.2% bin width pool trading volume. This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 0.1% bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility 
*  GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP
    *  Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by [other protocols](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Graham_/status/1762076544241955070) and leveraged farming is introduced
* Gyrsocope E-CLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks
    *  As the peg improves, one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg

The next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas:

* 1.00:1.00 peg with USD 
* Reducing price volatility
* Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations
* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools
* Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases

These efforts will need to scale to match GHO's expected growth profile. The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins, and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future, as well as participation in the launch of various projects like [Ethena](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and [f(x) Protocol's launch](https://x.com/protocol_fx/status/1762822716854354015?s=20). 

Though there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates, price volatility, and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations, we believe a high-level budget will look like the following:

| Objective | Category | Budget   |
| --------  | --------  | -------- |
| Liquidity | Peg Resilience | 360k GHO |
| DeFi Integrations  | Create Utility  |  140k GHO |
|Total| | 500k GHO|

It is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum.

# Performance Indicators

The below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking:

| Description| Optimal Value|
| --------  | --------  |
| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M |
| TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools  | 15M excl. stkGHO  |
| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |
| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap | < 0.10%  (GHO to USDC)|
| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  |
| Price level for > 90% time   | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  |

Please note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next 3 months on the assumption the Borrow Cap is continually increased beyond the current 35M Bucket Size. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.

The [stkGHO implementation](https://app.aave.com/staking), [USDe integration](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and coordinated efforts to attract users to acquire GHO are all great examples of how growth initiatives drive GHO utility, adoption and have a positive impact the spot price. 

Each of the above metrics, plus more, will be shown on the TokenLogic analytics dashboard.

# Specification

Swap the following assets for GHO:

* 250k aUSDT
* 250k aUSDC

Title: [ARFC] Orbit Program Renewal May 2024 
Date: 2024-05-13
Author: Marc Zeller - Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)
---

## Summary

Proposing the renewal of the Orbit program for recognized delegates, compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement of Gas costs associated with their governance activity.

## Motivation

Orbit recognizes the added value of the Delegates in the decentralization & diversity of the Aave DAO. This compensation allows them to focus on aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance. The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter.

With the transition to Governance V3, a significant feature introduced is gasless voting via Gelato integration on the [DAO-run governance app](https://vote.onaave.com), making it easier for delegates to participate without the burden of gas costs. This innovation prompts the proposal to discontinue the general gas rebate program. However, recognizing the continued necessity for proposal creation and payload deployment activities, we propose maintaining targeted gas rebates for these specific actions.

## Specification

* **Period Coverage:** Blocks 19162697 (5th Feb 2024) to Block 19860031 (May 13th 2024)
* **Eligible Platforms:**
	+ EzR3al
	+ Stable Labs
	+ Saucy Block
	+ Areta
* **Gas Rebate:** Since this period is entirely covered by Governance V3, the Orbit program does not reimburse delegate vote gas as their vote is now subsidized by Gelato. We will continue to reimburse Service Providers for their Governance-related activity:

   + ACI : 2.74 ETH
   + TokenLogic : 0.641 ETH

* **Budget:** 60000 GHO and 3.381 ETH
* **Relevant Links:**
	+ [Script output](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gov-V3-May-2024-Script-Output-af8acc9d53874444b9a576e2329da28a)
+ [ACI's Orbit tracker](https://apps.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker)


## Next Steps
1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is achieved, move this proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.
3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage for implementation and funding allocation in cooperation with Aave Finance service providers via an ad-hoc AIP vote or bundled in one of their treasury management AIPs.

### Title: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy whitelabel Aave V3 Market - Reental 
### Author: Rentaal & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
###  Date: 2024-06-11

---

### **Summary**
The current proposal aims to deploy a “whitelabel” version of Aave V3 for Reental tokens on the Polygon network. By allowing friendly forks of Aave V3, Aave can increase its technology adoption and provide an alternative source of revenue and synergies for the DAO and third-party teams.

### **Motivation**

Reental, in collaboration with Reental Master LLC, a protocol offering utility and functionalities associated with the Real World Assets (RWA) market, aims to deploy its collateralization market (ReenLever) on Aave's V3 platform. Reental stands as a global leader with extensive experience in real estate asset tokenization, having tokenized over $46 million across four countries on three continents. It uniquely combines these security tokens with its own utility token ($RNT), delivering significant benefits to its community of over 16,000 investors.

Reental is a key player in the global tokenization of RWAs, specifically in the real estate market. It offers investment opportunities in real estate assets to users worldwide. Currently, Reental has tokenized over 65 properties across four countries (USA, Spain, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic), totaling $25 million, with a community of 16,000 users from over 80 countries. 

With this track record, Reental stands as the only company worldwide with tokenized properties across four countries on three continents, aspiring to become a global entity with properties tokenized worldwide and partnerships with some of the sector's most prominent corporations: Civitas, Grupo ClerHP, Grupo BEC, M2Capital, Sibarys Capital, and others. 

In addition to its demonstrated traction as a leader in the Spanish-speaking RWA market over the past three years, Reental recently launched its utility token: $RNT. This tool enables the community to actively participate in the protocol, foster mutual growth, and transform user investors into stakeholders, creating a virtuous growth cycle.

### Specification

We are witnessing a highly favorable trend and narrative regarding RWAs, and Aave can maintain its leadership by embracing the unstoppable growth of this ecosystem. Reental can contribute to this growth with its collateralized lending market.

Reental proposes launching a whitelisted Aave V3 instance, bringing along the current $46 million tokenized volume, which could be collateralized immediately, and the potential for billions more in the coming years.

20% of the generated fees will be allocated to the Aave DAO. While the Reental market is not currently a significant business prospect for the Aave DAO, and it is not expected to be a significant revenue driver, the market has an interesting value proposition for off-chain collateral-based liquidity protocols.

This integration bridges the off-chain world with the on-chain realm through these RWAs, which are already yielding returns for investors.

Reental will assume the role of risk admin for this market, adding new properties monthly.

**Date:** 2023-03-22
- --

## **Simple Summary**

This Temperature Check seeks community input on the possibility of deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain to expand Aave's presence and tap into BNB Chain's growing DeFi ecosystem and user base.

## **Background**

BNB Chain is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. With a TVL of approximately $5 billion, BNB Chain is the third-largest chain by TVL. The chain has a diverse array of DeFi offerings, including prominent projects like PancakeSwap, Venus, and several others. Deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities.

## **Motivation**

Deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain has the potential to benefit both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and the potential for additional revenue. BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.

## **Specification**

This TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT.

shortDescription: Pre-approval for the Aave Governance v3 system, and its dependencies: a.DI and Robot v3
author: @bgdlabs
created: 2023-07-10
---

## Summary
This vote asks for approval from the community on 3 interdependent projects developed together within the Aave <> BGD Labs scope: Aave Governance v3, a.DI (Aave Delivery Infrastructure) and Aave Robot v3.

## Context
One of the main developments included into the Aave <> BGD Labs engagement was the next iteration of the governance system of Aave: v3.

In order to enable it, being heavy on cross-chain communication, we have also developed a.DI, a cross-chain communication abstraction layer of smart contracts.
Additionally, an instance of the already approved Aave Robot will be deployed for Governance v3, as layer of permissionless automation.
All of them, and specially Aave Governance and a.DI are inter-dependant.

**Title:** [ARFC] Set Aave Chan Initiative as Emission Manager for PYUSD on Aave V3 Ethereum Market 
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-03-04

---

## **Summary**

This ARFC proposes to set the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) wallet as the emission manager for the PYUSD token on Aave V3 Ethereum Market. This will enable the ACI to enact incentive programs funded by ecosystem partners for all PYUSD markets, promoting growth and expanding the user base of Aave. 

## Motivation

The Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) has been in discussion with various parties that have a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3 on the Ethereum Network. 

Recently, governance approved the [addition of PYUSD to Aave V3 Ethereum Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-pyusd-to-aave-v3-ethereum-market/16218). As a result, onboarding PYUSD into Aave has:

- Built synergies between Aave and PYUSD.
- Offered Aave users an additional stablecoin option.
- Strengthened the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin.

In order to facilitate emissions by various stakeholders, ACI proposes becoming the emissions manager for PYUSD on Aave V3 Ethereum Market. Emission incentives will be sent to ACI multisig and distributed as agreed on with partners. By setting the multisig as the emission manager for the PYUSD token, the ACI will be able to directly manage incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets on the Ethereum Chain.

## Specification

The Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) multisig address eth :0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd

will be set as Emissions manager.

The call to the setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract will be as follows:

`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(pyUSD,0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd);`

This method will set the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) wallet as the emission admin for the PYUSD token on Aave V3 Ethereum Market.

## Disclaimer

The Aave Chan Initiative is working with various partners to define the emissions program for PYUSD on Aave V3 Ethereum Market. ACI has not been paid by any third party for this proposal and will not be compensated for this work. 

## Next Steps

1. Gather feedback from the community.
2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage

17,"## Simple summary

Proposal for the approval of an interim distribution of 300’000 stable-coins from the Aave Collector to allow partial withdrawals by aAMPL suppliers to Aave v2 Ethereum, consequence of the problem detected end 2023.

Additionally, this proposal will include technical updates on the AMPL reserve to better settle accounting for this distribution.

 

## Motivation

On December 2023, a problem was detected on the AMPL custom reserve on Aave v2 Ethereum, causing an unexpected inflation of AMPL-related balances and supply, not following the intended design by the Ampleforth team.

While further analysis is performed for the most reasonable strategy on giving withdrawal liquidity for aAMPL supplies, an interim distribution of 300’000 USD value is proposed as lower threshold, to allow aAMPL suppliers to proceed partially with their withdrawals.

Also, as follow-up of previous AIPs, this proposal will include extra steps of not create problems accounting wise.

Important to read the full context on https://governance.aave.com/t/ampl-problem-on-aave-v2-ethereum/15886.

 

## Specification

The specific technical details will be defined at AIP stage once this ARFC will be approved, but high-level the payload will contain the following:

- Activation of a USDC/USDT distribution on AaveMerkleDistributor contract used in the past for the Rescue Mission of assets that users mistakenly sent to Aave contracts. The claims of each account will be defined as the percentage of the aAMPL total supply each one holds.
- Release of the 300’000 USD to the AaveMerkleDistributor.
- Update on the Aave v3 Ethereum pool for any kind of technical update (exclusively affecting the AMPL reserve) deemed necessary by technical service providers of the DAO.

 

## Disclaimer

BGD Labs is presenting this proposal within its engagement for technical services with the Aave DAO. Execution of it will depend exclusively on the decentralised Aave governance approving.

 

## Next Steps

1. In parallel with this Snapshot vote, preparing the final technical details of the AIP.
2. If the Snapshot outcome is YES, escalate to on-chain AIP stage.

Title: [ARC] LDO Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool
Author: @llamaxyz @MatthewGraham
Dated: 2022-11-05

---

# Simple Summary

In preparation for distributing incentives on the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool, @llamaxyz proposes amending the `Emission_Admin` address to enable the distribution of LDO rewards.

# Abstract

In collaboration with Lido, Llama seeks to distribute LDO incentives to the stMATIC Reserve on Polygon Aave v3. In order to achieve this, the `EmissionManager` contract needs to assign an owner to the `Emission_Admin` permission allowing LDO rewards to be distributed, [1,2]. This can only be achieved via the governance process.

This proposal assigns the `Emission_Admin` permission to LDO rewards to the following address `0x87D93d9B2C672bf9c9642d853a8682546a5012B5`. This address is controlled by Lido.

# Motivation

The motivation of the proposal is to enable LDO rewards to be distributed on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.

# Specification

The Lido Liquidity Mining Committee determines the emission rate and duration at which LDO rewards are offered. Standard practice is for the council to meet and determine the next 30 days of LDO rewards on a rolling basis. This means each month, the committee will determine if to extend the LDO rewards, or change the amount of LDO being offered across the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.

The `Emission_Admin` is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool. The `EmissionManager` determines the LDO `Emission_Admin` and not the stMATIC Reserve. The `Emission_Admin` can distribute LDO anywhere across the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool.

# Implementation

Set `Emission_Admin` permission for LDO on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool to Lido’s address: `0x87D93d9B2C672bf9c9642d853a8682546a5012B5`

Title: [ARFC] BUSD Offboarding Plan Part III
Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative
Date: 2023-07-25
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposal outlines the third part of the offboarding plan for BUSD on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The plan aims to further reduce the amount of liquidity in BUSD and encourage users to switch to other stablecoins. The plan involves modification of BUSD risk parameters and withdrawal of aBUSD from the collector contract. The plan will be enforced in a single AIP.

## Motivation

Please refer to the first and second parts of the BUSD offboarding plan for more context. The first two parts of the plan were successful, driving out liquidity and incentivizing active users to repay their debt and move their position to other stablecoins. The remaining vBUSD debt holders seem to be inactive or unaffected by high rates, due to the time-sensitive nature of BUSD/Paxos situation and the potential risk of protocol bad debt.

This third part of the offboarding plan will concentrate efforts on creating unsustainable positions for remaining borrowers to either motivate them enough to repay or reach liquidation thresholds.

Both actions are proposed to be performed:

- Modify risk parameters to “force” slope 2 interest rate curve and increase slope 2 aggressiveness
- Remove aBUSD from the collector contract to increase the utilization ratio of BUSD and increase the cost of open positions.

## Specification

The offboarding plan will be carried out in a single AIP with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| uOptimal | 1% |
| Reserve Factor | 99.9% |
| Base Rate | 100% |
| Slope 1 | 70% |
| Slope 2 | 300% |

This will result in a 470% APR cost at 100% utilization rate.

Withdrawal of aBUSD from the collector contract. The BUSD will be kept as such in the collector contract, and a separate AIP will organize the swap of BUSD into other assets at a later stage.

## Next Steps

1. If the community approves ARFC, Publication of an AIP implementation.

Optimism is proposing to deploy Aave V3 onto Optimism to bring one of DeFi’s most trusted lending protocols to the future of Ethereum. We want to support users who seek to earn interest and take out loans using Aave while avoiding Ethereum’s high fees. 

**Specifications**

Optimism is a Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup network designed to utilize the strong security guarantees of Ethereum while reducing its cost and latency. Optimism is EVM equivalent, making the transition from L1 to L2 as seamless as possible. This means one-click deployments and full compatibility with most of the tooling Ethereum developers are accustomed to. It also means that with very few exceptions, existing Solidity smart contracts can run on Optimism exactly how they run on Ethereum. You can read more about EVM Equilvance here:

**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)


# Summary
The purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.

# About Jarvis Network
Synthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.

jFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.

The protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.

We have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).

Combined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).

We also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.

jEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.

We debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.

The protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:

- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).
- $78M of volume on our primary market.
- 33k swaps by 9k users.
- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).
- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).
- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.
- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.

# Benefits for Aave V3
### Fiat on and off-ramp
jEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.

We have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).

Having jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.

### Large addressable market
A part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).

### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins
jEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.

### DDM
jEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.

### Low risk collateral
As collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.

jEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.

jEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.


# Risk Parameters
With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:

1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor
3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.

# Security specification and risks

### Risks inherent to jEUR
Besides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.

jEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.


[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)


### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.
jEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.

There is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.

It does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.

Title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - GHO Liquidity Strategy Update
Author: @TokenLogic
Dated: 2023-09-08

---

# Summary

This publication details the revised liquidity strategy for GHO across Ethereum DeFi.

# Motivation

This publication outlines the GHO liquidity strategy with two main objectives:

* Improve GHO peg
* Promote diversified liquidity across multiple exchanges

It is widely accepted that the GHO peg requires improvement. This was especially evident when GHO traded at beneath 96 cents.

Furthermore, several liquidity pools have come about organically on Maverick, Uniswap and Curve. Similar to the Balancer pools, these pools are mostly GHO which is reflective of the GHO price relative to the stable coin being paired within each pool.

Do note, the existing Balancer pools are not being supported by Aave DAO. These pools are being supported by veBAL and vlAURA holders, mostly from contributors within each community.

The two initial pools being considered are GHO/USDT/USDC and GHO/LUSD until SM integration. This will be presented in a separate forum publication for future discussion. This publication will outline the Primary and Secondary Pools being proposed for GHO:

* Balancer GHO/USDC/USDT - Primary
* Balancer GHO/LUSD - Primary
* Maverick GHO/LUSD Static - Secondary
* Maverick GHO/LUSD Both - Secondary
* Uniswap (Bunni) GHO/USDC Wide - Secondary
* Uniswap (Bunni) GHO/USDC Narrow - Secondary
* Curve Finance GHO/crvUSD - Secondary

For the purpose of this publication, we shall focus on the non Curve Finance pool. The GHO/crvUSD, and potentially GHO/FRAXBP, will be supported initially by the Aave DAO strategic asset holding once ready. How the DAO is to deploy the recently acquired CRV, is still yet to be determined.

This proposal aims to create a structure of liquidity outside of the SM strategy, including efficient options such as concentrated ranges of liquidity incentivised with and create a 3 months trial budget for vote incentives/rewards.

## Maverick

Maverick is an AMM capable of automating liquidity strategies without requiring maintenance. It enables to maximise capital efficiency by automating the concentration of liquidity as price moves. This built-in feature also helps LPs to eliminate the high gas fees that come from adjusting positions around price themselves.

MAV is the governance token, however the tokenomics aren’t fully revealed yet. It’s known that MAV has a veTokenomics model. MAV emissions didn’t start yet, but it’s possible to incentivize liquidity on Maverick by adding rewards by creating & incentivising a boosted pool for a defined amount of time between 3 to 30 days.

[A GHO/LUSD pool with 3 BPS & 0,1% width](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions/0x30856df27a23d72b67347165f85e04b15d716d9e?chain=1), with liquidity in the range from 0,9811 to 0,9980 GHO per LUSD has been created and incentivised by Liquity with 1,5k LQTY per 7 days during 3 weeks. Additionally, LUSD liquidity managers proposed to create co-incentives for GHO/LUSD pools by committing up to 5K LQTY/month for the trial duration if this proposal is approved.

Considering that a range can’t be updated by governance, and since the pool was full GHO a few days ago, we’re considering updating the strategy above by creating a wider mode static boosted pool, and creating a pool mode both on top.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H15VjV8ya.png)
    
As that the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch & since the unspent budget can’t be clawback (liquidity mining), incentives will start with a lower amount for a small duration (7 days) to easily follow the liquidity growth with the budget. Additional incentives can be added at any time.

Pros of incentivising liquidity on Maverick
* Automated rebalancing
* Fully customisable strategy
* Maximal liquidity efficiency
* Co-incentives if paired with LUSD
* Protocol Owned Liquidity can reduce costs

Cons of incentivizing liquidity on Maverick
* MAV emissions are not live yet
* Updating a range requires to create a new position
* Pools contracts are not verified yet
* Boosted pools incentives are limited to 30 days (can be renewed)

## Uniswap v3, Bunni.pro & Liquis

Uniswap V3 allows concentrated liquidity: liquidity allocated within a custom price range. It highly increases liquidity efficiency, leading to more volume, and with the potential of supporting stablecoins peg.

Bunni is a liquidity engine for incentivizing Uniswap v3 liquidity composed of two parts:

* Protocol that wraps Uniswap liquidity positions into fungible ERC-20 tokens
* vetokenomics system for incentivizing Bunni liquidity

It enables the creation of gauges receiving emissions while liquidity is in range. However, the liquidity isn’t actively rebalanced and gauges can be killed if the liquidity is out of range.

Liquis is a governance wrapper for Bunni.pro similar to Convex & Aura.

A [GHO/USDC pool with 0,05% fees](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x5c95d4b1c3321cf898d25949f41d50be2db5bc1d), with the range from 0,9497 to 1,0247 GHO per USDC has been created by community members. Timeless core contributors created an initial smaller range from 0,9757 to 1,0253 GHO per USDC, and submitted the proposal [TRC-66](https://gov.timelessfi.com/discussion/12245-trc-66-enable-ghousdc-gauge-with-2-cap) to enable GHO/USDC Gauge with 2% Cap on Bunni, which was [approved on July 27th](https://snapshot.org/#/timelessfi.eth/proposal/0xdf4027ad5c071bcbf045b9cb096ee63cae8bccacf4f33e489e50942c906419ee).

Ranges can be updated by governance, and since GHO went below the current price over the past days, we’re considering updating the wide range above, and creating a new narrow one on top.

The Aave DAO does not hold veLIT & oLIT incentives total worth is limited, so to reach the TVL target, this strategy will initially be supported with both veLIT/vlLIQ votes incentives created on Warden Quest, and GHO liquidity mining deposited on Bunni.pro gauges.
 
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H14_jELJ6.png)
    
Bunni gauges are not live yet, so the Min/Max APR on oLIT emissions will update depending on the actual working supply of each pool. For these estimations, the working supply used is from the current GHO-USDC proportionally to the estimated TVL.

Liquis just launched and will enable a better optimisation but the LIQ token has no price yet, and the first round vote ended on September 6th so it’s not yet included in the tables below but this strategy will most likely be improved in the coming weeks.

Nevertheless, they have a launch partner program ongoing giving access to LIQ tokens vested in exchange of a bribe amount committed over 6 months max, but closing this week as the protocol launched.

The conditions are 0,1% of LIQ supply vested over 4 years for 10,000$ worth of votes incentives for vlLIQ holders (controlling veLIT voting power). While the tokens are vested, the voting power can still be used until the end of the vesting duration, further increasing the yield or enabling recycling part of the bribes spent. More information on the program can be found [here](https://mirror.xyz/liquis.eth/K_-1jp7sLkylKc2V1XxkK0CObsqyaTq-89yScI4tapo).

veLIT bribes were initially considered, so if this proposal is approved, the Aave DAO will be a launch partner by committing an amount of $20k of votes incentives for vlLIQ holders over the next 3 months and will receive 0,2% of the LIQ supply.
 
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1m5oN8yp.png)
    
These estimations are made at the current time so it excludes LIQ emissions, liqLIT redemption mechanism, DAO vested voting power & impact on the strategy. The tables will be updated in the coming weeks if the overall strategy is approved. The proportion of bribes veLIT vs vs LIQ vs LM might also be optimized during the trial.

Similar to Maverick, as the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch & because the unspent budget can only be clawback, which represents a limited part of the budget, LM rewards will be added progressively every 7 days to follow the TVL growth.

Pros of incentivizing liquidity on Bunni/Liquis
* Built on top of Uniswap v3
* LIT tokenomics are live (oLIT & veBoost)
* Liquis (Convex-like) recently launched will enable strategy optimisation
* Launch partner program earning LIQ tokens vested & voting power
* Updating a range earning rewards can be done by governance
* Extra liquidity mining rewards can be added on Bunni gauges
* Protocol Owned liquidity can reduce costs

Cons of incentivizing liquidity on Bunni/Liquis
* Liquidity is not automatically rebalanced
* oLIT option token design is complex for users (liqLIT improves this)
* BPT 80/20 design & oLIT redemption create selling pressure on LIT token
* Reward are split between emissions from bribes + LM
* Bunni gauges can be killed if out of range ([Process](https://docs.bunni.pro/docs/guides/kill-gauge))

## Balancer & Aura:

As mentioned earlier, the existing Balancer pools are not being supported by Aave DAO yet and votes on GHO gauges depend on veBAL and vlAURA holders, mostly from contributors within each community. Moreover, GHO/USDC/USDT & GHO/LUSD are expected to be included in the SM at a later stage, but might need to create a base liquidity supported by the DAO before external votes fades away.

Both pools currently have classic gauges eligible for BAL rewards. According to recent changes from AIP-42, the budget allocated will be used to create vlAURA votes incentives on Warden Quest.

The initial strategy proposed is 400k vlAURA votes bribed to sustain 5% APR on a $5M TVL for each pool. The APR could be increased later on by using Aave voting power and blacklisting the DAO from the created Quests to attract more voters for the same cost.
 
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1m2iVIyp.png)
    
However, spending incentives on stableswap liquidity could be counter-effective before GHO peg is restored, so incentives might start after concentrated liquidity ones, and if the external support left.

Similar to Maverick & Bunni, since the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch, incentives will be deposited progressively to follow the liquidity growth. Nevertheless, 100% of the budget is spent in bribes so the unspent budget can be clawback on Warden Quest, enabling Aave DAO to pay a fixed price per vote for an important amount without overspending if the votes target isn’t reached.

As always, happy to fix potential mistakes in the strategies estimations if any.

The budget breakdown below contains two different margins:

* Assume that all strategies will begin to be incentivized at the same time, and with the maximum amount. It’s not what will happen but enables flexibility for the committee
* Assume that the bribe cost might increase and/or that more liquidity is needed on the different layers, so while the goal is not to spend it, a 20% buffer has been added to the committee budget (buffer not included in the above table)

## Summary

28,"**Proposal Summary**
Blockchain@Columbia, in conjunction with the Fantom and Axelar Team, are proposing to deploy Uniswap V3 on Fantom Chain. Given the BSL expiry, it is crucial for Uniswap to establish market share in other ecosystems. Deployment on Fantom would be beneficial to both Uniswap and Fantom. 

**Overview of Fantom**
Fantom Chain is a highly scalable and secure smart-contract platform designed to enable rapid deployment of dApps. Powered by its unique Directed Acyclic Graph framework and an advanced consensus mechanism, Fantom offers fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. Its innovative architecture has attracted numerous projects and developers.

**Motivation**
As an industry leader, Uniswap has established a strong presence in the DeFi space. In order to maintain its competitive edge, Uniswap must continue to adapt and expand its reach to other blockchain networks. This strategic move will capitalize on current market opportunities and strengthen Uniswap's position in the DeFi landscape.
Axelar is chosen for a number of reasons:
1. The Axelar Network boasts a decentralized Proof of Stake protocol, multiple layers of security features, and the ability to further customize security for Uniswap, if needed. This ensures a robust and secure bridge solution for Uniswap governance.
2. Axelar Network is reliable and has capacity to handle large-scale projects. The Axelar Network has been live for over a year, integrating more than 30 chains with 70 validators through its stack, processing over $1.8 billion in volume, and integrating with major DEXs, wallets, L1/L2, stablecoins, and other projects in the industry.
3. Axelar offers customization options for Uniswap, such as non-upgradable contracts, or contracts governed by Uniswap delegates or UNI token holders. Additionally, Axelar's network can be upgraded following delegated proof-of-stake consensus, ensuring continuous improvements and adaptability.
4. Axelar's General Message Passing capability enables developers building on one chain to call any function on any other connected chain, ensuring complete composability across Web3.
5. Axelar's security model combines a decentralized permissionless network, engineering best practices, and application-level security add-ons to offer robust security for Uniswap's deployment on Fantom.

**Outlook**
	While Fantom’s time in the spotlight has somewhat passed since “DeFi Summer”, the ecosystem still boasts a significant amount of TVL, hovering around $450 million for the majority of the past year with steady growth (DeFiLlama). There is a clear demand for decentralized exchanges on Fantom as four of the top ten protocols are decentralized exchanges, so there’s no doubt that Uniswap will be the leading DEX while also facilitating swaps for currently unavailable pairs. 
	Additionally, the Fantom Foundation has consistently worked to reduce the staking requirements for validators from 3.175m FTM in 2021 to 500,000 FTM. As the requirements needed to validate the network decreases, more users will be able to participate in the validation process.
	Fantom Chain's dedication to the Ethereum ecosystem is evident in its interoperability efforts, developer resources, and focus on driving the growth of decentralized finance. The Fantom team is also committed to fostering collaboration with Ethereum through Axelar Network to enable smooth asset transfers within the two ecosystems. We are convinced that deploying Uniswap on Fantom Chain offers numerous advantages to both Uniswap Labs and its users. 
	We estimate that 30% of the current DEX volume on Fantom would be routed to Uniswap should deployment occur. DEX volume on Fantom is available on DeFiLlama. Uniswap would receive an estimated $30-40 million in volume per week based on the data above as well as deployment on an highly-compatible, low cost chain to test new products and attract users.  

**Engagement Terms**
The deployment and its costs will be borne by the Fantom Foundation and Axelar. As such, no grants or subsidies will be offered to Uniswap. Axelar and Fantom will handle the backend deployment of the smart contracts; however, Uniswap will need to handle the frontend. 

**Bridge Security**

_Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?_
-Yes, arbitrary message passing was described in the Axelar white paper in January 2021, and Axelar released its General Message Passing (GMP) capability to mainnet in April 2022. For example, GMP enables developers building on one chain to call any function on any other connected chain. (We use the word “function” to encompass both smart contracts at the application layer and functions built at the protocol layer, as in Cosmos, for example.) That means complete composability across Web3.
-Like all Axelar functions, General Message Passing relies on a permissionless validator set (delegated proof-of-stake) for security and a decentralized protocol that handles routing and translation.

_Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?_
Robust security comes from (a) the right design, (b) engineering practices, and (c) application-level security add-ons:

(A) The Design: A decentralized permissionless network with a many-to-many communication model. The decentralized and permissionless model has the best practical security guarantees as it encourages diverse validator deployments, incentivizes validators to guard their keys, promotes good behavior, and punishes bad behavior.
-Axelar is the full-stack decentralized transport layer. At the core, it is powered by delegated proof-of-stake consensus to validate cross-chain messages. Applications can instantiate additional validation logic across connected paths 3 that may be governed by the application token, permissioned set, light-client, zk proofs, or other available technologies. Our approach is to:
(a) Offer the best-in-class security via decentralization as the default that solves most use cases for developers.
(b) Allow developers to customize security as needed.
-The Axelar network itself comprises a validator set responsible for maintaining the network and executing transactions, running the Cross-Chain Gateway Protocol, a multi-party cryptography overlay that sits on top of a Layer-1 blockchain. 
-Axelar Gateways are effectively smart contracts that connect the Axelar network to its interconnected external chains. Validators monitor Gateways for incoming transactions, which the validators READ. They then reach a consensus on the validity of that transaction and, once agreed, WRITE to the destination chain’s Gateway to execute the cross-chain transaction.
-The validators and Gateways compose the core infrastructure layer. It’s important to note that relaying across Axelar and its interconnected networks is completely permissionless. This guarantees that no one can censor user transactions and delivers 100% liveness guarantees (assuming the interconnected networks and the Axelar network are running). If relayers are down, the user or anyone else can post transactions, themselves. If one of the interconnected networks is halted or undergoing an upgrade, the packets are just queued up at the network layer and can subsequently be posted (or re-posted) when the networks are back up.
-Proof-of-stake decentralized design at the core - Axelar is built using battle-tested delegated proof-of-stake consensus with a diverse and dynamic validator set that is open to all.
-To further decentralize the network, cross-chain messages are approved if they’re authorized via the quadratic voting rule. That is, the voting power of each validator is equivalent to the square root of their stake. A threshold of validators (currently 60%), weighted by the square root of the stakes, must collectively co-authorize every cross-chain request. With quadratic voting, as validators accumulate stake, it gets harder for them to accumulate voting power.
-Amplify stake security - With Interchain Security available in the Cosmos ecosystem in the coming months, one network can “borrow” the security of other networks. This would allow it to increase the stake used for validation on the network, making any economic attack much more difficult. We also have plans to allow ETH holders to contribute to Axelar’s security, via the restaking model that Eigenlayer introduced recently.

(B) Engineering and Operational Practices
-Key rotations on the network - Validators of the Axelar network maintain keys that allow them to co-authorize cross-chain requests, similarly to how they co-authorize every block on the blockchain. 
-Continuous unit tests & end-to-end tests through the stack - Continuous unit tests and end-to-end tests help discover vulnerabilities and bugs early in the pipeline.
-Audits and bug bounties (see above).

(C) Application-Level Security Add-Ons
-Customize security - Additional paths can be secured by deploying additional validator sets, light-clients, and/or zero-knowledge proofs when available. We think this will be the best instantiation for the Uniswap community: leverage the robust Axelar network for all default traffic. If there is a highly valuable/sensitive transaction, utilize the additional UNI elected validator set for co-signing. See the Appendix for more details on how we propose customizing security for Uniswap.
-Rate limits - The Gateways and the Axelar network have a rate-limiting function, which limits how much of each asset can be transferred in a given time interval.

Sitting atop the validators and Gateways are Axelar services and APIs that enable developers to access the tools and infrastructure enabled by those validators and Gateways. These services and APIs do not add any security assumptions.

_Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?_
A majority of Axelar validators attest to messages that pass from Ethereum to a destination chain. The voting threshold is 60%, based on the validator’s quadratic stake (current stake distribution: Validators | Axelarscan). An adversary who can corrupt 60% of voting power can pass fraudulent messages. The adversary could try to corrupt enough servers to do this, but mechanisms such as key rotations & rate limits minimize the potential of these attacks.

_What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?_
-Axelar validators get slashed on the Cosmos SDK level, the same way that validators of any other Cosmos chains get slashed for misbehavior.
-There is a penalty for validators who don’t maintain sufficient uptime. When a validator doesn’t vote on enough cross-chain events, they’re penalized with a loss of stake and rewards.
-Validators who misbehave significantly (double signing blocks, not participating for a long period of time) get jailed.

Within the TM consensus rewards, rewards slashing rules are set as follows:
-Validators will lose the TM Consensus rewards if they lose liveness and get jailed if they don’t participate for a longer duration.
-Validators need to sign 50% of the blocks in every 35,000-block window.
-Given a block time of five seconds, this corresponds to maintaining total liveness for at least one day in every two-day window.
-They lose 0.01% of rewards per block for downtime and 2% for double signing blocks.

If the validators lose liveness for more than 50% of the window, then they are locked (“jailed” in Cosmos terminology, forbidden from rejoining the validator set) for two hours (about 1,440 blocks), after which they would need to unlock themselves. Axelar network implements an unbonding period of seven days.

_Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?_
-Yes, the Axelar network code has been audited over 30 times and continues to go through continuous and rigorous audits. 
-There is also a $2.25 million bug bounty program on Immunefi.
-Axelar network and contracts are all open-source to encourage white-hat revisions

**Future Alterations**
Once a cross-chain deployment method is finalized in the future, we wholeheartedly support changing current deployment mechanisms to fit the new process. However, given the urgency of this proposal, we believe that the currently proposed deployment with Axelar is needed. 

**Timeline**
After the completion of the on-chain vote, Axelar will handle Uniswap V3 smart contract deployments on Fantom while Uniswap Labs handles the front-end integration. This is estimated to take ~4-6 weeks with audits.",bullish

The primary objective of this budget proposal is to outline a strategic plan for the Governance Working Group (GWG) that ensures continued smooth operations of ApeCoin DAO and effective management of the AIP process. It initiates a more decentralized ApeCoin DAO through the GWG adopting a new non-profit DAO LLC structure, distinctly separate from the Foundation as a grouping of grant recipients and service providers.

The budget also includes provisions for conducting inclusive third-party sustainability and compliance studies tailored to the ApeCoin DAO and outlines plans to create a global community committee, bringing representatives together from delegations worldwide in a think-tank environment. Additionally, there are plans for a governance-centric community rewards program to incentivize actionable suggestions for operations process improvements.

An ApeCoin DAO voting and AIP analytics dashboard will be developed and a collaboration with Alex McCurry and Solidity.io will elevate the Apecoin.com website by providing language selection choices and enhancing the overall user experience to motivate visitors to delve deeper into the ApeCoin ecosystem. The GWG will closely coordinate with the recently approved Marketing & Communications Working Group to ensure that alignment with the ApeCoin brand identity is adhered to. 

The proposal presents a comprehensive framework of Objectives and Key Result (OKR) measurements designed to ensure accountability, inform the community about initiative progress, and hold Governance Working Group personnel accountable for their roles.

The Governance Working Group is a seven-person team comprised by Amplify, ALL CITY, Tiger, Lost, 12GAUGE, CryptoLogically and Vulkan.

#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

This proposal is aimed at enhancing the ApeCoin ecosystem in multiple ways. First, it seeks to uphold our commitment to providing seamless day-to-day DAO operations and an efficient AIP process. It introduces critical research and development ventures focused on broader economic sustainability and compliance for the ApeCoin DAO. Moreover, it places significant emphasis on community empowerment through various committee programs, thereby giving community members a more impactful role in the ApeCoin DAOs decision-making processes.

To recap, the proposal's core benefits encompass continued operational efficiency, sustainable legal frameworks, fiscal responsibility towards DAO spending, innovative R&D initiatives, and enhanced community involvement.

1. **Ongoing Operations of the ApeCoin DAO:** Continue to effectively manage the day-to-day operations of the ApeCoin DAO including AIP processing, facilitating Discourse and Discord, overseeing elections, drafting and implementing budgets, coordinating community committees, and implementing process improvements.

2. **Sustainability and Compliance Strategies:** Contract research firms to gain actionable insights and assess on-chain structures to better understand economically sustainable options for the broader ApeCoin DAO, prioritizing a non-custodial environment.

3. **Increased Adoption of APE:** We anticipate that our sustainability study and enhanced governance will stimulate both adoption and value within the ecosystem. This will offer an essential strategy for the APE token, enabling its widespread utilization across DeFi and web3 platforms. 

4. **Enhanced Transparency:** Provide detailed quarterly reports on expenditures, offering comprehensive insights into the DAO's spending patterns for the community, while identifying potential areas for optimization.

5. **Building the Working Group Blueprint:** As the first Working Group to be established and newly assembled, we will take no chances in building a safe, compliant organizational structure with the right professional service providers and advisors mentoring our every step. Our goal is simple: to become the gold standard of all Working Groups and build out the framework for others to follow.

6. **Website and Dashboard Development:** Elevate the user experience on Apecoin.com by creating a captivating interface that welcomes users, enables language selection and motivates visitors to explore and discover more about ApeCoin and the ApeCoin DAO. Our governance dashboard will display real-time analytics on key voting and AIP metrics as well as the ApeCoin DAO treasury.

7. **Community Empowerment:** Increase decentralized decision-making within the ApeCoin DAO and empower members to drive impactful change through committees and other initiatives aimed at providing a larger voice to constituents.

The goal of this proposal is to establish the ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group.

The ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group’s mandate is to:
“Build income generating projects for the ApeCoin DAO, ApeCoin Initiatives like ThankApe, Boring Security DAO, MBA licensed projects and the ApeCoin community. ApeChain will be a strong focus point once we reach that point.”

Working Groups enable a sustainable community-led infrastructure that further decentralizes the DAO, creates operational efficiency, and is flexible enough to adapt to any opportunities that may arise.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

It was recently announced that the ApeCoin DAO can receive revenue from AIPs and projects within the Ape and ApeCoin communities. There has been much talk around bringing much needed value back to the DAO and believe there needs to be a more structured focus on doing this. The ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group will focus solely on this and aims to create various projects and initiatives that will serve this exact purpose.

Working together as a community I feel we can implement various simple solutions that will drive value and needed resources back into the DAO and other initiatives alleviating the sell pressure on our much loved $APE token. In addition we expect to see the ApeChain come to life sooner, rather than later and there needs to be a strong focus on building on this to ensure it’s long term success.

If you build it, they will come…

## Title: [ARFC] OP Risk Parameters Update for Aave V3 Optimism Pool

## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative

## Date: 2023-08-25

---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the activation of OP as a borrowable asset in the Aave V3 Optimism pool. The aim is to adapt to the maturity of the L2 and attract more suppliers and borrowers, thereby generating new revenue for the protocol.

## Motivation

The Aave OP V3 market is one of the Aave V3 L2 deployments, with OP being the native asset of the OP L2. At its inception, the L2 was in its early stages, leading to the onboarding of OP with conservative parameters due to nascent liquidity & infrastructure. 

As the L2 has matured, the ACI proposes less conservative parameters for the OP asset. By removing the isolation mode for OP and allowing its borrowing, we anticipate attracting more suppliers who can earn a yield on their OP deposits and new borrowers who can use OP to borrow additional assets. This will also generate new revenue for the protocol. 

While the proposed changes are less conservative, they still maintain strict supply, borrow caps, and a conservative interest rate strategy. This ensures that the DAO promotes growth and new opportunities while remaining risk-averse. Based on the collected market data post-implementation, the community will have the opportunity to revisit these parameters at a later stage.

## Specification

- **Asset**: OP
- **OP Contract Address**: [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042)
- **Proposed Interest Rate Strategy Address**: [0x3B57B081dA6Af5e2759A57bD3211932Cb6176997](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3B57B081dA6Af5e2759A57bD3211932Cb6176997)

**New Risk Parameters**:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Asset | OP |
| Supply Cap | 10M |
| Borrow Cap | 500k |
| Loan To Value (LTV) | 30% |
| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 40% |
| Liquidation Penalty (LP) | 10% |
| Liquidation Protocol Fee (LPF) | 10% |
| Stable Borrow | Disabled |
| Base Variable Rate | 0% |
| Slope1 | 7% |
| Slope2 | 300% |
| Optimal Ratio | 45% |
| Reserve Factor (RF) | 20% |

### [ARFC]  Onboard Catapulta as Aave V3 Deployment Service Provider

### Author:  Kartojal & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

### Date: 2024-03-26

---

### **Summary**

The following proposal is to onboard [Catapulta](https://catapulta.sh/) as a Development Service Provider. The goal of Catapulta is to perform production and testnet Aave V3 instance deployments in EVM networks, approved by the Aave DAO.

### **Motivation**

The founder of Catapulta, David Racero, worked previously as Solidity Developer in Aave Companies during 2 years and a half, and was the main responsible for deployments scripting of Aave V2 and Aave V3 during the whole time at the company. 

Catapulta has created a smart contracts deployments platform that aims to automate certain manual workflows during deployments, like deployments reports, broadcasting txs and verifications in block explorers, allowing to speed up Web3 development cycles.

### Specification

Catapulta, as a potential Development Service Provider to the Aave DAO, will be focusing on the following scope of actions:

- Perform the deployment of new Aave V3 instances in EVM networks, in testnet and production, approved by the Aave DAO via Snapshot.
- Develop activation proposals for the Aave DAO to initialize Aave V3 instances, following all security procedures.
- Maintenance of Aave V3 deployment scripting to support new EVM networks.

The production deployment services will only happen once a positive [technical evaluation](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-deployments-technical-evaluation-framework-of-a-network/10237) AND snapshot approval from the Aave DAO.

Catapulta will reject any Aave V3 deployments requests from competitors or forks, and will pursue full transparency during the duration of the services. Catapulta will be in touch with all parties involved during the onboarding of a new Aave V3 instance, ex risk contributors, growth, development and security service providers.

### Duration & Proposed Budget

The duration for this service proposal will be 6 months.

Due the nature of the proposed services, that will only happen once a positive technical evaluation AND approval from the Aave DAO Governance, Catapulta has opted for a flat fee per production deployment.

- Fixed $15.000 USD in GHO or USDC, plus gas reimbursement, per Aave V3 production deployment, paid at the activation proposal.

title: [TEMP CHECK] Safety Module - Create GHO/USDC E-CLP Category
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
created: 2024-05-13

---

# Summary

This publication proposes creating a new Safety Module (SM) category for the GHO/USDC E-CLP by Gyroscope built on Balancer v2.

# Motivation

Similarly to Staked ABPT, the ability to stake GHO liquidity pool tokens improves the value proposition of the SM by providing the dual service of deep GHO liquidity and protection in the case of protocol shortfall events. Additionally, Liquidity Providers (LPs) can also benefit from earning trading fees.

The Gyroscope protocol developed a concentrated liquidity AMM called Elliptic Liquidity Pools (E-CLPs) that sits on top of Balancer. This technology achieves liquidity efficiency by providing assymetric liquidity to a specific price range based on parameters like amplification, price boundaries and peak location. More information about E-CLPs can be found [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps).

With GHO trading close to $1.00 and the [GHO Stability Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-fund-usdc-usdt-gsm/17566) to be funded, now is an ideal time to add a GHO LP to the SM. By adding the GHO-USDC E-CLP, it is expected to significantly improve market depth as well as USDC liquidity with the SM. Unlike other pool types on Balancer, the E-CLP requires dual asset deposits upon entering the LP.

The Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) developed expertise on the E-CLP technology designing and incentivising one [pool](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0x3932b187f440ce7703653b3908edc5bb7676c283/) optimized for volume when closer to peg and another [pool](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0x99e7b15df044e1b62e2e1774fd4469d54d9409ac/) optimized for price volatility.

# Specification

After studying various configuration of Gyroscope's E-CLPs, karpatkey_TokenLogic recommends adding the following E-CLP to Aave's SM.

![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5336955108681965996-y|1280x592](upload://lf2kNSuj4SOig7aU2KZOvOFfvro.jpeg)

![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5336955108681965997-y|1280x618](upload://qtM2oYr8FuDoWtjjeflW4MkgLBV.jpeg)

Create a new GHO/USDC E-CLP SM Category with the following characteristics:

| Description     | Value  |
| ---             | :---:  |
| Lower Bound     | $0.996 |
| Upper Bound     | $1.001 |
| Peak            | 0.9995 |
| Amplification   | 1,250  |

The following initial E-CLP SM parameter configuration is proposed optimizing emissions for a target liquidity of $5M at 20% APR:

| Description            | Value              |
| ---                    | :---:              |
| Emissions Nomination   | GHO                |
| Daily Emission         | 2,750              |
| Slashing Rate          | 50%                |
| Cooldown Period        | 20 days            |

This proposal also recommends that GHO/USDC E-LCP is included in FastPass with the following initial parameters:

| Description            | Value              |
| ---                    | :---:              |
| FastPass Fee           | 100 bps            |
| Fee Destination        | Collector Contract |
| Daily Withdrawal Limit | 500k               |

In addition to the above, we also recommend implementing the strategy detailed in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-gho-usdc-usdt-bpt-to-safety-module/15195) which enables the DAO via the vlAURA hodling to vote BAL and AURA rewards to this SM Category. This option then enables the Aave DAO to use is strategic assets to partially sustain the SM category.

Title: [ARFC]  Retroactive bug bounties proposal (pre-Immunefi)

Author: BGD Labs @bgdlabs

Date: 2024-01-09

---

## Summary

Request for bounties pending from before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi official bug bounty program, amounting a grand total of $86’500.

**The objective of this ARFC is to pre-authorise such payments, to be processed via an on-chain AIP**

## Motivation

Before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty program on [September 25th 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/325/), security reports by white hats where evaluated in an ad-hoc basis, proposing bounties/rewards following an approach like on [this proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077). That was not optimal, as there was no formal scope defined, or strict ranges of bounties depending on severity and impact.

Currently, every report is being processed via Immunefi and the rules of the Aave program, however, there were other reports submitted via other channel before that (usually security@aave.com). As these reports should be evaluated at time of submission for fairness, and outside of the Immunefi scope defined afterwards, we think it is a good idea to reward them separately and retro-actively outside the program.

## Specification

### Reports

First of all, we want to clarify certain aspects for the community:

- The proposed rewards and evaluation metrics follow the ones we did ad-hoc in the past [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077#clarification-on-evaluation-2), as we don’t think it is fair for the white-hats to apply the rewards ranges on the current Immunefi program and out-of-scope rules, as they were defined afterwards.
- In one of the cases, we recommended the white hat to submit the report via Immunefi, in order to have access to the mediation procedure of the platform. As this mediation process was finally requested by the white hat, Immunefi charges the corresponding fee of 10% of the amount, which we think is legitimate.
- At the moment, *we are not disclosing the full details of some of the reports*, because even if none of them create any risk for Aave now, one has dependencies with another report (not disclosed yet) and the other could increase risk to non-Aave entities.


### 1. Inconsistent validation on  Aave v2/v3

When calling `borrow()` with stable rate mode on Aave v2 and v3, one of the validations is that not more than a percentage of the total available liquidity can be borrowed at once.

However, `swapBorrowRateMode()` doesn’t validate the same, which is unexpected and could lead to more stable rate borrowings than intended.

It is important to highlight that this is not possible at the moment, with minting of stable rate disabled.


**Severity:  Low**

The issue didn’t create any immediate problem in the protocol, but overexposure to stable rate mode is not expected.

**Likelihood:  Certain**

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.

**Proposed bounty:** 10’000 USD

---

### 2. Inconsistent HF (Health Factor) behaviour swap borrow rate mode

When swapping borrow rate mode, the HF of an user is not validated, as debt should remain the same. However, under edge scenarios, the HF of an user could slightly change (by ~1 unit of lowest asset’s decimals).


**Severity:  No impact**

This is not a bug or creates any exploit scenario, but it is unexpected behaviour.

**Likelihood:  Certain**

This problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.

**Proposed bounty:** 5’000 USD

---

### 3. Price manipulation of asset listed on Aave

By executing a complex strategy (involving compromising the asset’s trusted infrastructure), it could be possible to inflate the price of one of the assets listed on Aave v2.

Even if this belongs more to the centralisation risk of the asset, and we don’t consider a bug of the protocol, it was taken into account for off-boarding consideration of the asset by risk providers of Aave, and we believe it is fair to reward retro-actively.

As this risk still exist on the asset itself and more protocols could be using it, even if we don’t really see any immediate risk, we will not be disclosing at the moment details of it, until the team applies extra measures.


**Severity:  Critical**

Being a price manipulation, the impact on the protocol would hypotetically be important.

**Likelihood: Not likely**

The attack involves compromising asset’s infrastructure (which would directly disqualify on the current Aave <> Immunefi program), together with extra techniques; so we consider it theoretically possible, but highly improbable.

**Proposed bounty:** 65’000 USD. Additionally, 6’500 USD as Immunefi fee.

If this ARFC is positive, afterwards we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal, releasing the funds to the corresponding addresses.",bullish

title: [TEMP CHECK] Allocating part of GHO Revenue to Safety Incentives
author: Marc Zeller, Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
date: 2023-06-07
---

## Abstract

This TEMP CHECK proposes the introduction of a dual reward system Safety Incentives, where a portion of GHO revenue is directed to the Aave Safety Incentives, enabling stakers (StkAAVE & StkBPT) to earn both AAVE and GHO tokens.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this TEMP CHECK is to enhance the sustainability of the Aave protocol by reducing its reliance on the Ecosystem Reserve of AAVE tokens for Safety Incentives. We propose a strategic shift towards harnessing protocol economic activity to generate ""real yield"" through the introduction of GHO as an additional Safety Incentive. 

By directing part of GHO revenue to the Safety Incentives, we aim to create a dual reward system, offering stakers both AAVE and GHO tokens. While the contribution of GHO to Safety Incentives may initially be a small fraction of the total incentives, it represents a significant step towards the protocol's maturity and sustainability. 

This proposal, suggests that the governance should adjust the distribution percentage quarterly, in response to market conditions.

As the Aave protocol already generates sustainable revenue that covers service provider costs, the introduction of GHO into the Safety Incentives mix is a viable and strategic move toward diversifying Safety Incentives and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the protocol.

### Potential Implementation

While technicals details of the implementation will be discussed at a potential ARFC stage of this proposal, and current stage is meant to gauge community's general interest, here's a diagram of a possible implementation, redirecting GHO revenue from Collector contract (dao treasury) to a splitter contract controlled by governance.

![image|2000x1028](upload://beyTiZ0BzFAVqdN2btMmu855a04.png)

### Initial Parameters

We propose to set a potential ""Gho Splitter"" contract with
- 80% toward COLLECTOR contract (Aave DAO treasury)
- 20% toward REWARDS_VAULT (controlling safety incentives)

## Next Steps

- If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage for service provider feedback and implementation discussions.

# Summary

This publication introduces @TokenLogic and @Karpatkey as the DAO’s Financial Service Provider for an initial period of 180 days, with a proposed budget of 400k GHO. The scope of contribution will span the following areas of the DAO’s finances:

* Treasury Management;
* Strategic Assets’ Liquidity; and
* Safety Module.

The combined karpatkey and TokenLogic team presents an unparalleled offering of specialized skills and proven technical expertise, with a network that spans most of DeFi.

# Motivation

## Treasury Management

Aave is the leading cross-chain lending protocol by all relevant KPIs i.e. TVL, supplied; and borrowed assets. With the latest version (v3) present on 10 networks, Aave Protocol currently generates revenue across ten networks and 18 deployments (v1, v2 incl. Centrifuge and ARC, v3 incl. Spark), consolidating a cross-chain treasury that’s currently worth around $130M.

![|576x335](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/63TVEW32fnDI7_Dg3E5Mzw1XnQJd8284sa4VJ_XfrFWfVLsiEH4lX134c-X5StL4qo7L5QZOQaId-a8MQURHy2Ml3eeDfuSe8DdXRwDF-wK9cMJm26NLZjw9Ys6PZRYCT3YeUl7m49HJo_5C_tt9NeI ""Chart"")

In spite of having a significantly sized treasury, the Aave DAO faces mainly three challenges with its current treasury composition and operational practice.

### Portfolio Volatility

A significant portion of the treasury is held in the DAO’s native token (AAVE) which currently has limited DeFi utility and introduces volatility in the overall treasury value. The following chart illustrates the treasury allocation across various crypto assets.

![|522x304](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MAvZlV6jGMF6UfYcfO54H761nqHULxFYABWN0b-et8UjKGF1T9ZhzphJZqwlT6r8RcvQ2q9ovKLmLddvKRSiwwUhsAtlFoYpJCimdbzf6bUI0JkRsxkfed0HGSfwvh646x_mVaJlLVIA1Lc9ZltgwKA ""Chart"")

### Asset Dispersion

Treasury funds are dispersed around multiple collector contracts deployed in different blockchains. These funds are a direct result of how the protocol captures value and are mostly denominated in aTokens (~61) according to market activity, which requires constant rebalancing to meet expense requirements. This activity has historically been carried out through the governance processes, lacking comprehensive and up-to-date data on portfolio composition and rationale for asset allocation.![|688x384](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TOGbL74wUrt6nMH83_jLP5kdJMQqX0Bnm4F0Qy3b605oaEz6z0xO1A3qw8ysj1hZdjzqm8MlSLP8hlesdTy3CegW3JEErznwfRdUX1YzgJS2ni8Cdb0btuuJE35VvcQi1KJVMB-Z3w7bVaSGVtlvn7U)

The DAO has only recently gained the ability to move funds between Polygon and Ethereum, while all other Treasuries are isolated, often leading to missed opportunities for leveraging the DAO’s funds. These opportunities are crucial for enhancing and capitalizing on synergies within the Aave ecosystem, including GHO management and the Safety Module.

### Runway

According to the latest [forecasted expenses](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/), the DAO’s 12-month budget is over $19M.

While there are ongoing plans to secure part of this amount of stablecoins, most of it is allocated in high utilization Aave lending markets. Although reckoning the strategic rationale, holding most of the assets in the DAO’s own protocol exposes the portfolio to excessive risk in a volatility event scenario e.g. exploit.

With the aim to support the protocol’s self-sustainability, treasury management should aim to reduce long tail asset exposure, ensure a 12-month financial runway and a stablecoins allocation that balances servicing Aave users and the DAO’s capital preservation.

## GHO Development

Aave developed [GHO](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/overview) as a stablecoin native to the ecosystem and controlled by Aave Governance that enables a new level of transparency and censorship resistance. Technically, [GHO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f#readContract) is a collateral-backed stablecoin minted by users who lock up collateral assets in Aave's v3 protocol. The protocol uses smart contracts to manage the issuance and burning of the token through allow-listed entities called [Facilitators](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/how-gho-works/gho-facilitators), whose capacity to mint GHO (bucket) is enabled by Aave’s governance.

Aiming to enable committed AAVE token holders to capture additional value, GHO’s [debt strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) introduces an innovative concept of [rate discount](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) by staking AAVE.

With an [on-chain vote executed in July](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/aave/proposal/268?chart=0), Aave launched GHO with two Facilitators (Aave itself and GHO FlashMinter), a borrowing rate of 1.5%, and a discount rate of 30% for AAVE stakers. Since then, the borrowing rate has been [increased to 4.72%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9789e054e29f63da5713368be2dd0b4006f4564ef5e48c9d5e994ec20e932e35).

![|691x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qdTC5Jy9o8-ciz62oGpAZDGq2KOMK7V2h1S8PL-G6oawfXSJMz02eQSaeIofbcvmatQBOGogKZSyVDeLZCHpbSLDRsiCATHipR5EGO0lzc4jwoaiB3VpInOtUgiypK9UTy6mIflJpvlS6yaAmcn4pHE)

As demonstrated by GHO’s price chart, the most immediate challenge the Aave community is facing is the persistent trading of GHO at a discount practically since deployment. This trend has been influenced by higher stablecoin-enabled market rates like MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate (DSR), creating a rate arbitrage opportunity. This cycle of borrowing and selling GHO harms GHO holders as it generates selling pressure, leading to a loss of value and eroding trust in GHO's stability. It also encourages a speculative pattern among GHO minters motivated to borrow and dump the asset, followed by repurchasing at a lower price, further driving down its value.

For the long-term health and success of GHO, two more enduring aspects require the community’s attention:

### Peg Mechanisms

There's a crucial need for robust peg mechanisms tailored specifically for GHO that go beyond tactical borrow rate adjustments. Such mechanisms should be designed to help maintain GHO's value relative to its peg, irrespective of broader market movements or temporary arbitrage opportunities. Effective peg maintenance strategies will provide the dual benefits of protecting GHO's value in turbulent market conditions and reinforcing its utility as a stable and reliable medium of exchange within the DeFi ecosystem, thus addressing the core issue of price stability head-on.

### Demand

The second one is generating organic demand that leads to an increased supply, mainly demand vectors external to the platform, but also including growth rooted in value-generating activities within the DeFi ecosystem. Without these value-generating flows, GHO faces the risk of remaining underutilized, hampering both its adoption and functionality as a stablecoin meant to facilitate economic activity.

![|654x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0K9JhuF5N6ScUkxYuGisZNp4S0IQ0qfc1ZvnW59aTIzisXhXB-4w5PX_2pzyTKs9sOlZkPikzm2IPx-uC_B366JsFOyHrmVqFYdLfmef0fBEaXquwkH-f48RAzVfmM9AqARhdcJ_EIQn7IrxaMv2fU0)

Currently, external demand for GHO has predominantly centered around its exchange for USD tokens and liquidity provision. While providing liquidity has been the sole avenue for yield generation, there has been a noticeable decrease in the allocated GHO liquidity recently.

## Safety Module

The Aave Safety Module (SM) provides the DAO with an insurance-like fund expected to repay users of lost funds resulting from Aave’s smart contract exposure. The current composition of the insurance fund is overweight AAVE to the point where there exists a negative feedback loop between potential Bad Debt exposure and the AAVE token price.

![|657x294](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Haaciw-Es4QZS2QZBueQ1g1ar-L_e_Lp6MRd1neEqlzndAy5gha5PLUtYYo1QKy_k80ZGSP-cEGf-rVYbRrqZ3L0W_m6kcN3EZBcW2ciXFr5FZnQR-jPlKBHKgzQ20dOmlAVksGqlflbCk-At3Uq4d4)

If a Short Fall event was to occur, speculators could frontrun the AAVE auction, potentially even trigger liquidations on Aave Protocol, and cause the auction to occur at a lower than otherwise AAVE price. This unintentional feedback loop can be partially mitigated by modifying the safety module fund with the introduction of additional assets over time.

Furthermore, the previously outlined negative feedback loop involving AAVE's price, liquidations, and bad debt results in a high cost for utilizing AAVE tokens. Consequently, it is necessary to reevaluate the incentivization of liquidity in the Safety Module, aiming for a more efficient allocation of DAO funds.

![|693x410](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/675CMMvT7wcInW2NSWdJ11ByiOKa-aC627ziLQQ_WSVR_nRljGEgKdaxRZbS5RRiAQ5MSVuYC-_Vu2_5fSiWBLtmxBuENsf2GJnBVqkOnTdgH4BabaF680wEQkHSWK2OxkO87lQs9ncUOhb8yQEcyPk)

The daily cost of sustaining the SM is estimated to be approximately 100k USD per day at the prevailing AAVE distribution rate and market price. If all the AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH can be auctioned off at spot prices, the insurance funds coverage ranges from 1.7% to 3.2% of TVL over the last 18 months. For each $1 of coverage provided, the Aave DAO is paying approximately 31 cents each year. With a reduction in AAVE rewards, as proposed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-amend-safety-module-aave-emissions/14936), the costs of sustaining the insurance fund will be reduced.

## Why Partnering?

All of the topics mentioned above are deeply connected. Most of the assets contained in the treasury derive their value partly from their liquidity and the protocol’s security; the Safety Module’s effectiveness relies on attracting external capital through LP incentives; and GHO’s peg mechanism is dependant on liquidity, which could be incentivized using the treasury’s holdings.

There hasn’t been a holistic approach to these core activities of Aave DAO’s financials so far, which ultimately has led to [uncoordinated](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061/11?u=karpatkey) and inefficient decision-making processes.

TokenLogic and karpatkey are partnering to provide Aave DAO with a comprehensive financial service solution. This partnership leverages:

* Over three years of experience in advancing the Aave Protocol through a pivotal role in feature development and product adoption; and
* A distinguished history of contributing to the most respected DAOs in the industry through specialized financial services.

The combined expertise of our teams is deeply rooted in the Aave ecosystem and extends across its community.

### TokenLogic

We are a proactive team that puts our partners' needs first. Our developers are already actively contributing to the Aave Protocol, 23 AIPs to date. We believe in Aave’s incremental improvement process and building solutions that enable the DAO to manage its finances efficiently whilst minimizing external dependencies.

Our dedication was demonstrated when we presented a proposal to improve the Aave DAO’s runway and built a preliminary frontend for the community. Our analysis will continue to showcase the interactive and transparent theme of the GHO Analytics platform. The refined scope primarily focuses on Treasury Management, GHO Liquidity/adoption and the Safety Module.

### karpatkey

karpatkey is a DeFi-native organization specializing in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with [GnosisDAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkeys-weekly-report-on-gnosisdao-farms/6219), [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386), [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665), [CoW Protocol](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624), and [Lido](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xac31f800288c68e32d1eb3cea7a525022faae3eb3bf805d1b3d248cda5375a13) on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions. Check out our [values](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-values) to understand a bit more about our guiding and decision-making principles.

As DAO treasury developers, we contributed to some of the most reputable DeFi protocols in our industry. We supported the adoption of xDAI across Gnosis Chain, [paving the way](https://x.com/GnosisDAO/status/1673343419232526340) for the deployment of sDAI that [boosted chain TVL](https://x.com/DLNewsInfo/status/1714990022598787118) and consolidated a stablecoin hub with the integrations like Angle and Spark. Our extensive experience provided us with advanced practical knowledge on DeFi primitives like stableswap and concentrated liquidity AMMs, liquidity, and voting incentives, veTokenomics, leverage and lending platforms, and integrations with top protocols.

In addition to being an active [Aave delegate](https://governance.aave.com/t/karpatkey-delegate-platform/14417) with more than 90 governance votes since August 7th, we’ve contributed to the [development of an Aave fork](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2022-year-in-review-for-gnosis/6431#lending-protocols-5) project and historically deployed, borrowed, and staked a combined $26.51M worth of LP positions in both Aave V2 and V3.

We now believe we can meaningfully contribute to solidifying Aave’s position as the leading DeFi lending protocol, not only through domain expertise but mostly through pushing positive-sum initiatives with the DAOs we work with.

# Specification

This proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO's treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.

## Architecture for Asset Management Tooling

We aim to define and implement a robust architecture for asset management. At a high level, this architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s ""shortExecutor"". All designs will be aligned with Aave best practices, and will encompass required steps to update existing infrastructure (e.g. SAM).

As the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.

## Financial Security

A key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO's known budget and anticipated expenses as shared above. This approach guarantees financial stability and an operational continuity for Aave DAO.

Key components of this objective will include:

* Bridging Aave funds from other blockchains to consolidate them in Ethereum;
* Migrating primary stablecoin funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3 for improved experience in using aTokens as payments; and
* Swapping secondary stablecoins in mainnet prioritizing GHO.

Do note, Financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.

As it currently stands, all necessary preparation for incorporating financial statements as part of the earlier TokenLogic proposal has been paused due to overall Aave budget considerations.

## Formation of the Aave Liquidity Committee

This expanded committee will oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:

* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO's price movement towards re-pegging, while maintaining its utility across a full range AMMs.
  * Utilize Maverick's design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.
  * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.
  * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.
  * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility on their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave's AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.
* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token's value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:
  * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.
  * Enhance GHO's extrinsic demand by incentivizing stableswap pools, such as Balancer's GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.
  * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer's architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO's price stability.
  * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.
  * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.
* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it in",neutral
51,"## Goal of the vote

0x Labs would like to gather signal from the community on support for the proposed Metatransaction and Multiplex upgrades as proposed in [ZEIP-96](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/96).

## Scope

The forum post on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-96-metatransactionsfeaturev2-and-multiplex-upgrades/3543](https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-96-metatransactionsfeaturev2-and-multiplex-upgrades/3543).

In summary, the proposed changes will provide two main benefits: (1) improve gas efficiency of the metatransaction feature and (2) enable OTC order formats to be included in multihop transactions that would expand the sources of liquidity that can be considered and make meta-aggregation more price competitive.

A subsequent vote (ZEIP-96) will be conducted if this temperature check is successful to integrate the proposed smart contract changes to the `exchangeProxy`.

title: [TEMP CHECK] Safety Module Upgrade Part II - Asset Diversity, SM Categories & Slashing Updates
discussions: 
author: @Llamaxyz - @dydymoon & @TokenLogic
created: 2023-04-13

---

# Summary

This publication presents the community the opportunity to discuss Safety Module (SM) upgrades that enhance asset diversification, introduces risk tranching and potential growth synergies.

# Abstract

This publication presents the community with the opportunity to expand the assets accepted within the SM. Currently, the SM is overly concentrated in AAVE via direct AAVE staking and ABPT staking which is a Balancer v1 80/20 AAVE/wETH liquidity token.

This publication seeks to explore the community's appetite to diversify the SM asset base and vary the portion of users' funds which can be auctioned in the event of a shortfall. Currently, 30% of user deposits are at risk when depositing into the SM.

# Motivation

@bgdlabs is currently proposing to upgrade the [SM architecture](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-v1-5/12148) to support the launch of GHO, by enabling stkAAVE holders to access cheaper GHO borrowing rates. Further to this, Llama has kick started the conversation around migrating AAVE liquidity from Balancer v1 to v2 in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-safety-module-update-part-i-migrate-aave-weth-balancer-v1-pool-to-balancer-v2/12748).

Several comments relating to the AAVE concentration and auction mechanism have been made on the forum which can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/size-x-aave-auction-safety-module/11984), [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029) and [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-extend-safety-module-coverage-to-polygon-v3/11876/4).

This publication presents three distinct categories for inclusion in the SM.

* Single Asset
* Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions
* Stable Asset Liquidity Positions

The net change to the existing implementation is the introduction of a third category, Stable Asset Liquidity Positions. The existing AAVE and ABPT represent Single Asset and Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions.

Although any Liquidity Provider (LP) position can be included, G-Uni, crvLP, BPT etc… This publication will initially focus on the overarching concept and how BPTs could be integrated.

BPTs were selected due to Aave’s relationship with Balancer DAO and the veBAL holding which the community may elect to utilize here. It should be stressed, Aave DAO will elect which assets are to be included and the varying levels of slashing for each category.

Assets considered for inclusion should have minimal counterparty risk and display great on-chain liquidity amongst other considerations such as price correlation with Aave Protocol’s TVL during varying market conditions.

Llama proposes three initial asset categories to be created within the SM.

The slashing parameters update aims to reduce the price impact on the AAVE token in the case of a shortfall event. We propose adding different levels of slashing to each category, as follows:

## Single Assets

The current single asset, with 30% slashing, is AAVE. This proposal introduces other assets to this category with the goal of reducing the concentration of AAVE inside the insurance fund.

Possible assets for consideration inside the SM Single Asset Category include, not limited to:

* AAVE
* ETH and/or wstETH

If the community elects with the introduction of additional assets other than AAVE, then each asset could be considered individually. This publication retains the 30% slashing feature for Single Asset.

The inclusion of wstETH may attract additional incentives from Lido DAO, therefore Llama prefers having the ability to distribute multiple rewards types with external teams able to distribute their own token. Something similar to the Emission Admin role on Aave v3 will suffice.

Llama preference is for wstETH over wETH due to improved capital efficiency by enabling users to earn an overall higher APY from being a SM depositor. wstETH has become a major trading pairing token on Balancer and it has ample liquidity across various pools to route swaps through. Additionally, the stETH-ETH discount has reduced significantly (0.9938:1 for 100K ETH sold, which also demonstrates [very deep liquidity](https://swap.defillama.com/?chain=ethereum&from=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&to=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).

Llama would also encourage Lido DAO to indicate any potential support for this type of integration between the two protocols as inclusion in the SM would act to help retain or grow wstETH adoption via the creation of a unique use case for wstETH relative to other LSTs.

Max slashing proposed: 30% retained for single assets.

Initial assets proposed: AAVE / ETH and/or stETH

## Risks Considerations

If LSTs (such as wstETH) are included in the SM, it creates a price divergence risk which, if sustained, can reduce the cover in the SM and create an unfair distribution of the rewards between ETH & wstETH. Post redemption the main risk consideration for LSTs becomes counterparty risk which if it materialized would lead to a significant discount to the LST price in ETH terms.

* To limit the de-peg risk, the SM could stop incentivizing below a defined ratio, so the total value would then be deduced from the total cover value. This acts to mitigate counterparty risk without requiring governance intervention.

Based upon technical feedback relating to the ease of implementation, Llama may revise this section of the publication.

## Volatile Liquidity Provider Tokens

In addition to the replacement pool for the 80/20 AAVE/wETH pool on Balancer v1, to be determined by an earlier publication. This publication presents two other pools of strategic importance to Aave DAO for inclusion in the SM.

This publication presents the prospect of creating an 80/20 GHO/wETH (or wstETH) which offers less impermanent loss than a 50/50 pool whilst also providing very deep liquidity for risk off events which see spikes in stable coin swap volumes which can often lead to stable coins trading above $1.

For the following categories, up to 75% of the current budget could be allocated.

Max slashing proposed 45% for volatile BPTs

Initial volatile BPTs proposed: B-80AAVE-20wstETH (or Part I proposal results) & B-80GHO-20WETH

Even if not yet created, this is probably the most interesting addition to this category as the trading volume of this pool will generate an important yield for LPs. The second pool could also be converted into a [Balancer Core Pool](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) by replacing ETH by IBTs as described in Part I.

## Stable Liquidity Provider Tokens

In this third category, this publication presents an initial pool consisting of the Balancer [3pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x79c58f70905f734641735bc61e45c19dd9ad60bc0000000000000000000004e7) and GHO. Like other categories, in the future, additional assets can be added. If the community elects to launch BB-A-USD/GHO on Balancer or a stable coin pool on Curve, then this section can pivot to include the Curve pool.

Max slashing proposed: 60% for stable

Initial Stable BPT proposed: B-3Pool/GHO

This pool introduces a stable asset to the SM design and generates a significant amount of the coverage as 60% of the TVL can be slashed with very low price impact across the broader ecosystem. This is especially the case if something like Cowswap’s auction mechanism was to feature in the new SM auction mechanism.

By integrating a GHO pair to the SM, Aave is essentially helping bootstrapping GHO adoptions through incentivised liquidity. Aave will also earn revenue from the GHO borrowing rate.

If the community elects to proceed with 3CRV/GHO, then this would increase the SM smart contract surface area through diversifying exposure concentration away from Balancer to include Cuve Finance and potentially Convex Finance risk as well.

There is also the option of adding additional pools which could include GHO, MAI, LUSD, FRAX and others once live like crvUSD etc…

This proposal can be implemented independently from the following parts. In this case, “classic” gauges would be advised. Otherwise, the strategy & smBPT gauges discussions will be outlined & discussed in Part III.

# Technical Specifications:

* Remove the BPT 80/20 from the current main module (30% slashing)
* Deploy two other modules on the SM for the new categories (45% & 60% slashing)
* Implement the new assets voted on Part II for the new categories
* Create the new pools depending on vote results

54,"Penn Blockchain (FranklinDAO) is creating this proposal in partnership with Matter Labs to Deploy Uniswap V3 on zkSync.

Deploy Uniswap V3 to zkSync

Summary

To support Uniswap’s multichain mission and expand cross-chain experiences, we propose the deployment of Uniswap V3 to zkSync 2.0 on behalf of the community.

zkSync ecosystem has over 100 projects committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc.
Deploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Uniswap by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation
zkSync shares Ethereum’s ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership

We welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved.

About zkSync

zkSync 2.0 is a ZK rollup (https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups) that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security.

zkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers:

EVM Compatible - supporting generalized EVM smart contracts on a ZK rollup making it easy to deploy existing dApps
ToolChain Compatible - able to port smart contracts with existing tools
Ethos Compatible - aligned with the ethos of decentralization and open-source
Certainty - using zero knowledge proofs offering certainty of security not probability
Future Proof - ecosystem partners that adopt zkSync 2.0 now will enjoy all future improvements without the need to change their code

There is broad consensus that ZK rollups are the endgame for scaling Ethereum. zkSync’s EVM compatibility, ease of use, and composability will accelerate developer and retail adoption. Top researchers including Vitalik Buterin recognize ZK rollups as the long term scaling solution.

Security & Bridges

ZK rollups are the most secure scalability solution available today as they rely purely on math to fully inherit the security of Ethereum. There is a general L1<>L2 communication bridge which will support arbitrary message passing and secured by validity proof and Ethereum consensus.

Bridge validators can’t pass an incorrect message or change the content, the worst case would be to censor everyone. Importantly, we’ll be building out additional safety functionality and monitoring off & on-chain activity.

Security is top of mind for zkSync. We are currently working with tier-1 auditors for zkSync 2.0 and specifically in the review process for the bridge code. Audits will be conducted before each major upgrade. Besides audits, we offer a substantial bug bounty program.

Proposal

There’s significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkSync helps solidify Uniswap’s place as the number one DEX and a thought leader. 

Importantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Established projects like Argent, Curve, and Yearn have committed to launch along with over 100 more projects and big infrastructure players like Chainlink, The Graph, Gnosis are supporting the ecosystem. Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing and using Uniswap v3 codebase will solidify Uniswap’s influence in the Ethereum ecosystem which is moving on to ZK rollups.

While the zkSync ecosystem is already experiencing very fast growth, the team is planning  programs to attract and fund innovative projects and research partners to accelerate the network’s adoption and in turn, Uniswap’s usage. 

License Exemption

We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Matter Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on zkSync provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on zkSync by Matter Labs through the “Deploy Uniswap V3 Script” albeit we may need to modify the compilation step with approval from the Uniswap Labs team. 

Timeline

Following the Consensus Check and Governance Proposal we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap V3 deployment on zkSync. 

zkSync has been on testnet since February 2022 and plans to launch mainnet early October. A timely assessment of the deployment of Uniswap v3 code to zkSync is important: while deploying on zkSync is fast and easy because it’s fully EVM compatible, we estimate the full effort will take 4-6 weeks given Uniswap’s relevance. This allows for proper testing, communication to the community and engagement with the broader zkSync ecosystem.",bullish

57,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal, entitled the “Exploring New Frontiers: Bring ApeCoin ($Ape) into the Mobile Gaming World,” also known as AIP-xxx brings the utilities and values of ApeCoin to thousands of new holders through its integration into the Meta Merge game – a pet collection and mobile evolution game powered by AIGC and Ultiverse.

By integrating ApeCoin into the game, $Ape becomes another in-game asset in Meta Merge for new holders and game players to enjoy gamified experiences based on real-world utility. We aim to reinforce and leverage ApeCoin and its ecosystem by creating new user experiences through the power of the game. Thus, this integration will provide an ecosystem where players can utilize APE tokens within the game, alongside the other benefits they know APE tokens for.

title: [ARFC] Ethereum v2 Reserve Factor Adjustment
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic @ChaosLabs
created: 2024-02-27

---

# Summary

This publication proposes periodically increasing the Aave v2 Ethereum Reserve Factor (RF) to encourage users to migrate to Aave v3.

# Motivation

With Aave v3 now crossing the $8 Billion TVL threshold and $3 Billion remaining in Aave v2, this publication seeks to encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3 by increasing the RF.

With all other variables held constant, increasing the RF over time in isolation will result in a reducing deposit rate. Users are encourage to migrate to v3 in search of higher yield.

With market conditions permitting, we propose initiating a periodic 5.00% RF increase across all assets every 14 days as mentioned [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766) up to a threshold of 99.99%. During each increase cycle, we will monitor how users respond and, if any potential risks are identified, the next RF increase will be delayed until it is safe to implement.

Do note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect users' health factor, and this method has already been [implemented on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350) for some time. 

# Specification

The below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.

| BAT  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| CRV  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| CVX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| DAI  | 25.00% | 30.00% |
| DPI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |

| RAI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| REN  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| renFIL| 35.00%| 99.99% |
| SNX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| sUSD | 30.00% | 35.00% |
| SUSHI| 99.00% | 99.99% |
| TUSD | 99.00% | 99.99% |

| YFI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |
| ZRX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |

Upon implementing this proposal, a subsequent AIP will be submitted every 2 weeks that increases the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99%, subject to market conditions.

62,"This proposal will authorize [0xPlasma Labs](https://plasma.finance/) to deploy the Uniswap v3 protocol (Fee Tier: 1, 0.3, 0.05, 0.01) to the BNB PoS Chain on behalf of the community.

We believe this is the right moment for Uniswap to deploy on BNB PoS Chain, for many reasons (one of them is License expiration).

## Uniswap v3 current stats

Total Value Locked - **$3.65B**

Chain Breakdown
Ethereum - **$3.41B**
Polygon - **$101.93M**
Arbitrum - **$85.08M**
Optimism - **$47.04M**
Celo - **$1.26M**

> Potential TVL from BNB Chain: **1/2 * $2.36B (PancakeSwap) ~ $1.18B** 

## The Important reasons why Uniswap v3 should be deployed to BNB Chain as soon as possible

1. BNB Chain has a large and growing user base, providing a potential new market for Uniswap v3.
2. BNB Chain offers high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a suitable platform for Uniswap’s decentralized exchange services.
3. Deploying to BNB Chain could help Uniswap to tap into the growing popularity of DeFi in the Binance ecosystem.
4. BNB Chain offers unique features such as staking and cross-chain support that could enhance Uniswap v3’s functionality.
5. BNB Chain’s strong governance model and active community could provide valuable support and feedback for the development of Uniswap v3.
6. Binance, the company behind BNB Chain, has a strong track record of supporting and promoting high-quality projects, potentially providing valuable exposure for Uniswap v3.
7. Binance has a global presence and a strong brand, which could help increase awareness and adoption of Uniswap v3 among retail and institutional investors.
8. Binance offers a range of products and services that could be integrated with Uniswap v3, such as the Binance Smart Chain and Binance DEX.
9. Deploying to BNB Chain could provide opportunities for collaboration and partnerships with other projects on the Binance ecosystem.
10. BNB Chain strongly focuses on security and compliance, providing a safe and trusted environment for Uniswap v3 to operate.
11. BNB Chain has a robust ecosystem of dApps and DeFi projects, providing potential opportunities for collaboration and co-development.
12. BNB Chain’s support for on-chain governance could enable Uniswap v3 to adopt a more decentralized and community-driven development model.
13. BNB Chain’s support for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could enable Uniswap v3 to adopt a more decentralized and community-driven business model.
14. BNB Chain’s strong emphasis on community engagement and participation could provide valuable support and feedback for Uniswap v3.
15. BNB Chain’s commitment to regulatory compliance could provide valuable support for Uniswap v3 as it seeks to expand into new markets and jurisdictions.
16. BNB Chain’s support for tokenization and digital asset management could enable Uniswap v3 to offer new services and features for users.
17. BNB Chain’s a fast-developing ecosystem of decentralized finance dapps and assets.

## Why BNB DeFi ecosystem needs Uniswap v3

* BNB Chain has a big DeFi development community that needs a more advanced DEX ecosystem to boost the general DeFi ecosystem development
* Bridge supports BNB Chain needs a better liquidity source with less slippage
* Assets need more reliable DEX infrastructure to provide their users with a better trading experience
* We need to educate all BNB community about what is real DeFi and yield using Uniswap v3 as a reference.

## What can Uniswap Ecosystem get from BNB chain deployment?

* Additional $1B of TVL + huge trading volume + earned fees for LPs
* 1-2M new users + UNI holders
* Huge respect and appreciation from DeFi devs
* More adoption for Uniswap NFT Platform (as BNB chain has a weak infra for NFTs)

## Financial Incentives for Liquidity

We can consider a launch of Liquidity Farming and [Quadrat Protocol ](https://plasma.finance/quadrat) for Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain, to attract more liquidity and incentives from BNB protocols and users.

## Security and Governance Bridge

0xPlasma Labs would like to propose using [Celer Bridge](https://www.celer.network/) for the Governance cross-chain messaging.

Here is a piece of information about the Celer Bridge provided by @modong 

#### A quick introduction to Celer:

Celer is a generalized blockchain interoperability protocol enabling a one-click user experience accessing tokens, DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, governance, and more across multiple chains. Developers can build inter-chain-native dApps using the Celer Inter-chain Message (IM) SDK 1 to gain access to efficient liquidity utilization, coherent application logic, and shared states. There are 10+ cross-chain applications live today that are built with Celer IM on various use cases including governance and liquidity network protocols. cBridge, a cross-chain asset bridge solution, has processed $12.2b transaction volume across 31 chains for 200K users.

#### How to build Uniswap’s cross-chain governance (with a focus on security models)

Celer IM based cross-chain governance is already live in production with [FutureSwap](https://twitter.com/CelerNetwork/status/1518791556169306113) since the end of April 2022 and has been operating flawlessly since. The reference implementation of cross-chain governance is very straightforward and we describe the high level flow here based on the [application design pattern](https://im-docs.celer.network/developer/celer-im-design-patterns#cross-chain-logic-execution-without-fund-transfer).

When a governance decision is made on Ethereum, the governance contract will call [sendMessage](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-contracts/blob/d879d4cf1a3b69d8cc7c56bb9512a6a493c5be0d/contracts/message/framework/MessageSenderApp.sol#L24) of a “send box” contract which takes in the destination chain ids, message to be passed and destination contract addresses. The message will contain the serialized bytes of the governance decision.

This message will be synced with State Guardian Network, which is a Cosmos SDK based blockchain. Validators in SGN will witness the message and reach consensus on the Cosmos layer that this message indeeded exists and generate a stake-weighted multisignature attestation that is stored on the chain.

A message executor (can be run by Uniswap or run by validators of Celer Network) will collect this message and call [executeMessage](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-contracts/blob/d879d4cf1a3b69d8cc7c56bb9512a6a493c5be0d/contracts/message/framework/MessageReceiverApp.sol#L71) of a “receive box” contract. After necessary on-chain validation of the message, the message will be eventually relayed to the destination contract.

The validation, except for the generic checking of the validity of the signatures, also has two security models available to determine when the target contract will receive the message. The first security model is to directly pass the message on and rely fully on PoS security of the Cosmos chain.

However, in the case of low-frequency applications like cross-chain governance, we recommend using the **second security model**: an optimistic rollup-like security model. In this security model, every message that is passed onto the destination chain will be first put into a “quarantine zone” for a configurable period of time. During that quarantine period, every single validator in the SGN and the application executor (collectively, App Guardians) can monitor and cross-check the message arrived on the destination chain vs sent on the source chain. If there is any mismatch, the message path will be cut off immediately and the message will not be executed. This changes the security assumption from “trust majority stake” to “trust any” with app developers capable of running one of the “any” App Guardians themselves. This is how FutureSwap implemented their cross-chain governance module.

Once the quarantine clock times out, the message will be executed by calling a standard interface on the destination governance contract. This will complete the cross-chain governance process.

Next, we answer the questions raised in the post.

#### Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?

Of course, this is the core of Celer, and all the cross-chain applications are built on top of this functionality. Celer currently supports arbitrary message passing on all EVM-based chains. For non-EVM chains, Celer supports Aptos, Sui, Flow and Cosmos-based blockchains.

#### Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?

This is briefly discussed in the previous walkthrough. Here, we provide a more detailed description.

As discussed above, Celer’s generalized message cross-chain solution comes with two security models and we recommend using the optimistic rollup solution here. More context on Celer’s security models:

Celer comes with two security models that each app and users are free to choose from on a per-tx basis.

1. Cosmos-consensus Security Model

By default, inter-chain dApps rely on the security of the State Guardian Network (a Cosmos Chain) by processing messages routed from another chain without delay. The SGN offers L1-blockchain level security just like Cosmos or Polygon with it being a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built on Tendermint with CELR as the staking asset. If a guardian acts maliciously, its staked CELR will be slashed by the consensus protocol. This level of economic security is something that grows with the staked CELR’s value and is simply not available in simple Multi-signature or MPC/PoA-based solutions.

2. Optimistic-rollup-style delay buffer Security Model ( **what should be used in this case** )

![](upload://8uf1PmN8Xra57O4ORLU5SjzZ2AW)

So, what happens if more than two thirds (in staked value) of the validators behave maliciously in the State Guardian Network? Although this is highly unlikely given the economical security and distributed nature of the validators in Celer Network, Celer does have a second security model, inspired by the Optimistic Rollup design, that works securely even under this worst-case scenario.

Instead of instantly processing a message routed by the SGN, a two-phase commit-confirm pattern is used to process any inter-chain message. Before any application consumes the message, the message has to be “committed” to the blockchain by SGN into a “quarantine zone” for a period of time. Only after the delay has passed, can this message be “confirmed” and pushed to the final destination application.

During this delay buffer, a dApp can run an App Guardian service to double-validate the message on the source chain and check the authenticity of the message committed in the quarantine zone. If the App Guardian detects any inconsistency, it can prevent the message from being processed before the time buffer expires. For application developers who cannot run an App Guardian themselves, they can commission the SGN nodes to undertake the task of an App Guardian. In that case, the security model is strengthened to a trust-any model for the SGN. Therefore, even under the worst-case scenario of the SGN consensus failure, inter-chain dApps built on top of Celer’s construct will still maintain safety property without any concern.

#### Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity?

When operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, the security is dependent on the source chain and on the “trust-any” model as described in the security model section. It does not depend on any single third-party entity or a majority of decentralized parties. As long as one single app guardian is still working in a trustworthy way, the system is secure.

#### Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?

When operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, as long as there is still one app guardian that is trustworthy, it is not possible to have any fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain.

This is very different from other models where when a majority (often 2/3) of validators/MPC signers are compromised, a fraudulent message can be passed to the destination chain.

#### What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?

Their CELR stake will be slashed.

#### Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?

Celer was audited by Certik, Slowmist and Peckshield. No vulnerabilities were identified in any of the audits. We also have a $2M standing bug bounty on Immunefi that is not claimed yet. Celer is the only cross-chain system that has processed more than $1b with no vulnerability exploited or identified.

## License Exemption

We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow the 0xPlasma Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on BNB Chain, a layer 1 EVM compatible blockchain, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on BNB Chain by the 0xPlasma Labs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script. ](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)” 0xPlasma Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.",neutral

## Title : [ARFC] wGHO Aave V3 Onboarding

## Author : Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs

## Date: 2023-09-15
---
## Summary

This proposal aims to onboard wGHO, an ERC-20 token wrapper of GHO, as a collateral-only asset in a newly created stablecoin emode within the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.

## Motivation

The onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.

This integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.

Alongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.

It's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.

wGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. 

## Specification

The ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:

- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset & isolation mode asset.
- wGHO parameters:

| LTV | 77% |
| --- | --- |
| LT | 80%  |
| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |
| Supply Cap | 1M |
| Borrow Cap | 0 |
| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |

### Note:

wGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.

Onboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.

64,"##### ABSTRACT
AIP ID #420 holds special importance within the crypto industry and the Ape community.

This proposal seeks to temporarily reserve AIP ID #420 to create a meaningful impact for the DAO. The proposal team would collaborate with the community to organize a competition where the winner is awarded AIP ID #420 and an ApeCoin grant.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The community engagement resulting from the decision and the decision-making process may enhance cohesion, excitement, and involvement among ApeCoin holders. This proposal would preserve the cultural significance of AIP-420 within the ApeCoin DAO.

##### OVERALL COST 
This proposal requests 420,000 ApeCoin from the DAO’s Ecosystem Fund for the community contest. The winner of the contest will be awarded with AIP #420 and a reasonable grant not exceeding 420,000 ApeCoin.

TLDR: We want to save AIP ID #420 to help give it a chance to create a meaningful impact for the DAO. The community would have a contest to award the AIP ID #420 along with a grant, this would be the first step to help ensure AIP ID #420 doesn’t end up in the Rejected AIPs folder.

This Temp Check proposes implementing the dedicated GHO Steward as a dynamic parameter change mechanism to ensure efficient risk management and support the peg of Aave Protocol's native multi-collateral stablecoin GHO during the initial stages. 

## Introduction 

As the Aave DAO prepares for the introduction of GHO, it is crucial for the community to consider implementing a mechanism that offers greater agility to adjust risk parameters in the initial stages of launch.  

To support the maintenance of the peg, the proposed GHO Steward multisig acts as a dynamic parameter change mechanism. It enables swift adjustments to risk parameters, in the form of scoped governance delegation, where the full governance process could potentially be time-consuming and hinder timely response to evolving circumstances.

By employing this mechanism, the Aave Protocol ensures transparency and enables flexible parameter changes through decentralized governance. This approach reinforces commitment to preserving the peg and effectively addressing market challenges that may arise upon the launch of GHO.

## Key Terms

The “bucket capacity” refers to the maximum amount of GHO that can be minted by a Facilitator. The ability to adapt the bucket capacity by adjusting supply, supports stability by ensuring that available supply meets demand.

The “borrow rate” refers to the interest rate paid when borrowing GHO. The borrowing rate may also be used to support stability because of its impact on demand.

You can learn more about GHO in the docs [here](https://docs.gho.xyz/).

## GHO Steward Permissions

Aave V3 provides a high level of granularity around permissions. Building on the concept of [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/4?u=aavecompanies), it is proposed that a dedicated GHO Steward multisig be introduced to support the initial GHO governance risk mechanism to be able to implement agile parameter changes in the form of scoped governance delegation.

The GHO Steward multisig would be 2/2 and would include the DAO’s risk providers Chaos Labs and Gauntlet.

The GHO Steward would be capable of adjusting predefined parameters, including: increasing the bucket capacity (by up to 100%) and changing the borrow rate (by up to 50 basis points in either direction) in a single change. Parameter updates could only occur once every 5 days per the parameter.

It is proposed that the GHO Steward would be deactivated 60 days after the passing of this proposal. However, the DAO can vote to renew the GHO Steward for another 60 days if deemed necessary. The DAO can also vote to remove the GHO Stewards at any time.

## Governance Process

This proposal emphasizes the importance of decentralization and community involvement in the decision-making process, fostering a robust and inclusive ecosystem. The GHO Risk Steward would enable agile parameter changes for GHO; however, decisions shouldn’t be made in isolation and should go through a lean governance process.

The proposed lean process is as follows:

1. Proposal on the Governance Forum explaining the rationale of the proposed action.

2. Snapshot requirements:
a) 24-hour duration starting from the posting of the proposal.
b) Quorum 250,000 AAVE.
c) A minimum of 70% of votes FOR the change.

3. Change can be enacted as soon as the proposal passes Snapshot.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the GHO Steward serves as an initial agile parameter change mechanism driven by decentralized governance. It highlights the Aave Protocol's commitment to maintaining GHO stability and addressing market challenges during the launch period.

While the proposal acknowledges the potential for a more dynamic rate-changing governance model in the future, the current framework allows the DAO to effectively manage GHO's parameters in the short term.",bullish

67,"**Title:** [TEMP CHECK] Updated Aave Grants Continuation Proposal

**Author:** Bill & @0xmigi

**Date:** 09-25-2023

---

Thank you to everyone who participated in the TEMP CHECK: Continue Aave Grants Proposal. This is an updated proposal based on the feedback that was received. The main changes that has been made from the previous proposal are:

* The Events & Sponsorship budget and activities have been removed.
* Swapping the AAVE portion of funding with stables.
* Introducing a $20k max grant size.

# Summary

An opportunity to continue Aave Grants DAO (AGD) for 6 months by preserving the current AGD treasury holdings, providing $400,000 of new funding in ARB, and increasing AGD’s stablecoin allowance by $328,000.

This proposal will enable AGD to deliver and improve upon the top tier grants program the Aave ecosystem has had over the past 2+ years and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem. AGD will fund $500,000 in developer grants per quarter, drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption, and set the groundwork for the next chapter of the continued evolution of AGD.

# Overview

Throughout the previous proposal, AGD has:

* Awarded 50 new grants and made 15 payments to grantees based on milestone completion.

* Engaged builders and the community at five events, including four hackathons where AGD awarded a total of 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties and inspired 58 teams to hack with Aave and GHO.

* Proliferated the ghost by hosting 1 rAAVE to strengthen Aave’s culture, bring the community together, and cultivate an ecosystem with the best contributors.

* Exercised prudence with the treasury by decreasing the average grant size awarded by 52.8% and maintaining average reviewer compensation at ~22% of the monthly maximum budget.

This proposal outlines renewing AGD for the next 6 months by:

* Providing new funding of $400,000 in ARB (~18% of the total ARB received by Aave DAO)

* Increasing AGD’s stablecoin allowance by $328,000.

# History

![Timeline|1280x490](upload://8UmNLA3q2rDe51LE1bpp2iCpUOh.jpeg)

Since its inception in May 2021, AGD has awarded $4,852,753 across 249 grants.

From the last AGD proposal in January 2023 to now, AGD has awarded 50 grants and awarded 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties across four different hackathons.

*Note: All $ cost amounts are calculated at time of payment, pre/post token value fluctuations are not included unless otherwise specified. Pending payments are not included.

This is the fifth proposal for AGD:

* The[ initial proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-community-grants-program/3642) launched AGD in May 2021 with $1 million of total funding over two quarters.

* The[ second proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-grants-update-and-renewal/6371) was executed at the end of December 2021 and funded AGD for three months with $2 million of funding.

* The[ third proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-grants-dao-update-and-renewal/7842) was executed at the end of May 2022 and funded AGD for six months with $3 million per quarter.

* The[ fourth proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-aave-grants-dao-renewal/11289) was executed at the end of January 2023 and funded AGD for six months with $1.625 million per quarter.

# Since the Last Proposal

The community has been kept up to date with AGD’s[ activity in @0xmigi’s monthly governance updates](https://governance.aave.com/t/agd-renewal-4-recent-work-updates/11585), the[ Halfway Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/agd-renewal-4-april-2023-halfway-updates/13683), and through AGD being added to[ Llama’s treasury dashboard](https://community.llama.xyz/aave/grants). The [AGD website](https://aavegrants.org/) houses a running list since inception of grants awarded, event and sponsorship spend and other information.

The GHO release was an exciting launch for the Aave community and was a prioritized focus throughout AGD’s last proposal. AGD began to spread awareness about GHO’s launch and encouraged early development with GHO across the four hackathons that were sponsored. AGD also funded multiple GHO related grants and supported development with the introduction of ‘Request for Grants’, inviting projects that help to stimulate GHO’s demand and increase its utility to apply for a grant.

## AGD Budget

AGD has exercised prudence with the treasury, while continuing to fund high quality builders and drive growth and experimentation in the Aave ecosystem. The current AGD treasury, including token allowances and OP, is roughly $1,450,895. Part of the reduced spend is because of a reduction in the average size of grants awarded. The average grant size awarded so far in 2023 is 52.8% lower than the average grant size awarded during 2022, currently at $13,936.

## Other Initiatives

* **Increasing Grantee Accountability.** There has been an influx in grantees (e.g. recently [Defi Simulator](https://governance.aave.com/t/introduction-defi-simulator/13166), [Projection Finance](https://governance.aave.com/t/introduction-blockchain-education-network-aave-tutorials-learning-content/14448), and [Aave Alarm](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-mobile-notifier-app/14082)) posting directly on the forum to introduce themselves, explain their grant, and to keep the community updated as they progress. Most of these posts are the result of an initiative from AGD to better increase grantee accountability and engagement with the community.

* **‘Requests for Grants’ (RFGs).** [A pilot project has been introduced](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-request-for-grants-by-aave-grants-dao-gho-governance-op/14125) to better direct builders to apply for grants in certain high impact areas. Going forward, AGD will look to expand the list of RFGs to target high impact areas and community needs by better communicating with different contributors and encouraging anyone to make suggestions.

* **AGD Operations and Best Practices.** Over the last two years of operations, AGD’s values and best practices have been refined and adopted. It is a priority for AGD to clearly define and share these values and best practices with the community. Here is an overview of AGD’s current process:

![Process|1280x466](upload://AbmHHvqATIWjmJubiH87yZgGKvX.jpeg)

# Grantee Highlights

Since AGD’s last proposal, 50 new grants have been awarded and 15 follow up milestone payments have been made. Of the 50 new grants awarded, 22 are complete, live or have reached notable milestones at the time of writing. Each grant has positively impacted different aspects of the Aave ecosystem.

![Grants by Category|1280x856](upload://p42bwb2ZXMR7EZCIoR8rgS3v76B.jpeg)

Here are some recent highlights from grantees:

**[Dullahan](https://dullahan.paladin.vote/)**

Designed and launched a hub for GHO to drive adoption. Dullahan produces passive income for stkAAVE holders and provides GHO borrowers with access to reduced interest rates and has over 3,000 AAVE in deposits a few weeks after launch.

**[Sommelier Finance](https://app.sommelier.finance/strategies/Real-Yield-ETH/manage)**

Enables the creation of state-of-the-art DeFi strategies that leverage Aave V3 and GHO with the development and audit of a Aave V3 adaptor used by Sommelier strategies. As of July, their Aave V3 integration has allocated a net of $4M to Aave V3.

**[AAVE based CIAN Strategies & Automation Tools](https://dapp.cian.app/strategy/maticleveraged/create)**

Expands access to Aave V3 with open source vaults and advanced automation tooling, allowing strategists to generate strategies and users to easily access yield. As of August 2023, CIAN has generated $55M in TVL across Aave V2 and V3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, Ethereum Mainnet, Avalanche and Optimism via its leveraged staking strategies.

Other applications include: [DeFi Simulator](https://defisim.xyz/), [Aave Alarm](https://github.com/nebolax/aavealarm), [Projection Finance](https://aavev3.projection.finance/) and [Karma HQ’s Delegate Dashboard](https://aave.karmahq.xyz/).

**[IntoTheBlock Risk Radar for GHO](https://defirisk.intotheblock.com/metrics/ethereum/aave_gho)**

Helps the community understand GHO's activity with 20 dedicated risk indicators including peg performance, collateral distribution and whale credit history.

**[Xenophon Labs](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-raising-the-safety-module-s-slashing-percentage/14167)**

Performed an analysis on the Safety Module proposing an increase in the slashing percentage with the intent of saving the Aave protocol ~$2.1M per year

**[Butter](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732/19)**

Facilitated an incentivized delegate initiative which kickstarted paying Aave delegates, encouraged participation in Aave governance from new community members and sparked TokenLogic to start their delegate platform.

**[Senate](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb5da30d8d949c3f00f4a34cd68cdddba9e64dfaf47f75ab3bd8d164fcd001279)**

Reducing the friction of engaging with Aave governance by implementing their notification and alert system in the governance forum.

**[Flexible aToken Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting/blob/master/src/ATokenFlexVoting.sol)** ScopeLift

Unlocks the potential for new deposits by enabling protocols to allow users to retain voting power with tokens that are active in DeFi like Aave.

**[AwesomeQA](https://home.awesomeqa.xyz/)**

Streamlined the community support process with their Discord bot that automatically and quickly responds to user questions. In the past 3 months, the bot has answered over 55% of all questions, with 30% of those answers voted up by users indicating the response was very helpful.

# Operational Focuses for this Proposal

The path to a decentralized and sustainable AGD is a long journey. Here are some initiatives planned for this proposal to continue working towards an effective and sustainable AGD:

**Finish Establishing Legal Entity**

Establishing a legal entity allows AGD to begin operating more independently and with more protection and certainty for contributors by providing a legal structure for members and the ability to operate with the traditional financial world. As it currently exists, AGD is not able to even sign a contract. Transitioning to an entity is a big step for AGD’s maturity by providing clarity and protection to contributors, along with increasing operational effectiveness.

AGD is currently finalizing the process of establishing a Cayman Foundation Company. The grants process will continue to operate as it does today and there will be no noticeable changes to AGD’s current processes or operations for the community.

**Revamping Review Committee**

AGD will update the processes and structure around the review committee. [One idea AGD will explore](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-further-decentralising-the-aave-grants-dao/14452/22) is introducing a rotating committee of community experts to serve short (3-6 months) time frames as grant reviewers. This will further involve the community in AGD while bringing expertise from different community members.

**AGD and Service Provider Alignment**

With the increased number of Service Providers, there is a need to create better alignment between AGD and the work being done across the Aave DAO. Introducing simple activities like regular touch points would enable AGD to better (de)prioritize areas for grants based on feedback and insights from service providers. Where appropriate, AGD can also better work with service providers on helping to define the scope of related grants.

**Measuring Impact**

AGD aims to enhance the way it measures impact from grants by further developing internal resources and working with teams such as [Spindl](https://www.spindl.xyz/) to better track the impact effectiveness of grants.

Starting with specific categories of grants like quests, AGD will better visualize activity driven by grants and gain insights into the effectiveness of different spend. Over time, AGD will extend similar tracking to other grant categories and impact metrics. This will enable the community to better track impact from grantees and empower AGD to make better review decisions.

# People

AGD now has ten members.

* Lead. Bill oversees the growth of the team, the distribution of grants, and making sure AGD meets the strategic needs of Aave DAO.

* Review Committee. The Review Committee is made up of:

* Corbin Page - Paymagic, ex-ConsenSys

* Calvin Chu - Impossible Finance

* Francis Gowen - Flipside Crypto

* Lawrence Mosley - Omni Analytics

* Kakashi - Symphony

* Andrew Allen - Coinbase

* David Truong - [x23.ai](https://x23.ai/), ex-Aave Companies Genesis team dev

* Operations Lead. Neil has streamlined the application process, manages payments, KYC, and other administrative tasks.

* Analyst. Migi is the main touch point with current and future grantees. He finds opportunities where AGD can support grantees and track the returns generated. Migi also provides monthly updates on the governance forum.

**Compensation:**

* Lead: $9k/month

* Review committee: $150/hr, capped at 10 hrs/week

  * Reviewer pay per month has averaged $1,273/month per reviewer since May 2021. We will look to modify this as part of the overall revamp of the review committee.

* Analyst: $5k/month

* Operations lead: $150/hr capped at 20 hrs/month

* Designer and other roles: one-off based on specific design engagements

The roles and compensation will be reviewed and iterated on in line with the focuses outlined above.

# Proposed Budgets

This proposal's total budget will be split between a Grants Budget, an Events & Sponsorship Budget, and an Operations Budget. In total across all three budgets the total ask for the next 6 months is:

* $400,000 in ARB

* $328,000 increase in AGD’s stablecoin allowance

This would make AGD's treasury, including allowances 64.6% in stables, 11.5% in AAVE, and 23.9% in ARB & OP.

$292,000 that was previously allocated to 'Digital Marketing' spend has been reallocated to this budget.

Notably for the stablecoin portion of the treasury, AGD has started to explore further driving GHO adoption and grantee alignment by collaborating with @TokenLogic to [swap AGD's DAI allowance with GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-replace-agd-s-dai-allowance-with-gho-allowance/14631). AGD will look to continue to do this with other stablecoin holdings in the future based on similar style governance proposals.

## Grants Budget

|                    	| Carry Forward | Ask    	| Tokens for Ask |
|------------------------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Developer Grants   	| $614,980  	| $300,000   | Stables    	|
|                    	| $133,000  	| $0     	| OP         	|
|                    	| $0        	| $400,000   | ARB        	|
| **Grants Total Budgeted Cost** | **$747,980**	| **$700,000**   |            	|



The OP is based on the 100,000 OP[ allocated to AGD during the previous proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-allocation-of-300k-op-received-by-aave-grants-dao/12820). In line with the total amount of OP AGD has (300,000 OP), AGD is requesting $400,000 in ARB tokens to support the growth and development of projects building on top of Aave on Arbitrum. This is equivalent to ~18% of the total ARB received (at current prices) and is in line with the[ community’s preference](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xea8b9cc41076ba43c8a66dfd40ce539b3126af049639babce6c1fa3e62585b79) to allocate the full amount of ARB received across multiple options. Any ARB unspent during this proposal will be kept in the AGD treasury and allocated to future proposals.

AGD will introduce a new $20k max grant size for all grants and double down on kickstarting the growth of new teams building on top of Aave and GHO.

## Operations Budget

|                                             	| Carry Forward | Ask   	| Tokens for Ask |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Compensation                                	| $20,150   	| $300,000  | Stables    	|
| Maintenance: Tooling, subscriptions, gas reimbursements | $526     	| $20,000   | Stables    	|
| Legal Buffer                                	| $69,984   	| $0    	|    	|
| **Operations Total Budgeted Cost**          	| **$90,660**   | **$320,000** |            	|


Increasing the overall amount allocated to operations, especially compensation, is necessary for AGD to grow its resources and operate more independently.

### Paragraph Summary

LUSD is stablecoin minted directly by the protocol users by opening a Trove and depositing ETH as collateral. Loans are interest-free, with a 0.5% base initiation fee. All the contracts of the Liquity protocol are immutable, which makes LUSD the most trustless stablecoin currently available on the Ethereum mainnet.

LUSD is overcollateralized by ETH with two main mechanisms helping it keep its peg: first, LUSD can be redeemed for ETH at face value (i.e., 1 LUSD for $1 of ETH). Secondly, there is a minimal collateral ratio of 110%. Both mechanisms respectively create a price floor and ceiling through arbitrage opportunities.

Since the protocol is immutable, no additional developments are planned, yet the Liquity team is working on another project that will prove synergetic with LUSD.

LUSD’s resilience makes it a highly sought-after stablecoin for DAOs and protocols looking to diversify their treasury and users looking for cost-effective leverage on ETH. The current focus is to grow the DeFi ecosystem around LUSD to enable more diverse use cases.

This proposal aims to add LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave v2 mainnet (0% LTV). If the current proposal is met with enthusiasm, other proposals will follow suit.

### Specifications

#### AIP author status

I, TokenBrice, author of this ARC [recently joined](https://tokenbrice.xyz/joining-liquity/) the Liquity team to help with DeFi strategy.

#### Overview of the project and token

Liquity is a protocol offering cost-efficient leverage using ETH as collateral. While its base design can be described as similar to Maker/DAI, there are several key differences:

* Only ETH is accepted as collateral to maximize the protocol's trustlessness and resilience.
* There is no interest fee on Liquity. Instead, the borrowers pay a predictable initiation fee starting at 0,5% — and ramping up algorithmically when needed to protect the protocol.
* Liquidations are close to instant, and enabled by a protocol-level backstop: [the stability pool](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations), a reserve of LUSD deposited by users.
* Just like Aave, Liquity uses ChainLink as the main price feed. However there is a [fallback system](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations) in place, switching to Tellor, if the ChainLink price feed data is deemed incoherent.
* Since the contracts are immutable, there is no governance. There is still a token associated with the protocol – [LQTY](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6dea81c8171d0ba574754ef6f8b412f2ed88c54d), but it’s used for incentivization and fee-sharing purposes only.
* The minimal required collateralization ratio is lower – at 110%, increasing the capital efficiency of the protocol. This is possible thanks to the stability pool and instant liquidation mechanism which also helps maintain the peg by acting as a liquidity buffer. A failsafe mechanism, called the Recovery Mode, is triggered when the total collateralization ratio of the protocol falls below 150%. Being an exceptional measure, the Recovery Mode enforces more substantial restrictions on the Troves, such as temporary minimal collateralization of 150%, until the total collateralization ratio of the protocol recovers. So far, it was only triggered once in the early days of the protocol.

#### Positioning within Aave Ecosystem

LUSD is a stablecoin offering some genuinely unique features, the leading one being the trustlessness of the whole Liquity protocol. In that sense, LUSD is one of the most resilient stablecoin and the most decentralized. Similar to the addition of RAI on Aave, having LUSD will help Aave diversify from the current dominance of centralized stablecoins such as USDC used for borrowing.

Furthermore, as mentioned above, this proposal is the first step. Several others could follow to nurture the relationship between Aave and Liquity further:

1. Enablement of LUSD as collateral (LTV>0%)
2. Enablement of efficiency mode against selected stablecoins once v3 mainnet is live.
3. Addition of LUSD on Aave/Optimism + potential enablement as collateral + again enablement of the efficiency mode.

I believe that LUSD as a borrowable asset will be met with a strong demand: it will be the first time such a resilient stablecoin could be borrowed on Aave and the first protocol where LUSD is borrowable.

#### History of the project and its components

The Liquity protocol was launched on the 5th of April, 2021. As the code is immutable, there has been no update since then. However, the team is still actively working on the protocol' DeFi integrations, such as supporting LUSD liquidity on Curve.

Since the demand for LUSD is directly dependent on the appetite for leverage on ETH, the LUSD supply had varied quite a bit since the launch, with the highest point around 1.5B LUSD when ETH reached a peak price of ~$4K. The following correction on ETH, with the lowest point around $2K, led to a drastic reduction in the LUSD supply – this episode is the first and so far unique time when the Recovery Mode was triggered. Since this episode, the supply has stabilized more and is now around 325M LUSD. This episode was the first massive stress test for the Liquity Protocol, which handled it gracefully – a recap is available here:

https://www.liquity.org/blog/how-liquity-handled-its-first-big-stress-test

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiezquc6y7pkordcigvzwfwhgjfagnilxeweeuawycupuq6gsb3jxa)
    


Since the protocol launch, various DeFi integrations have been built on top of the Liquity Protocol, here are some of the most notable:

* A Curve pool (+integration on Convex and Yearn) was created against the 3Pool and became the main liquidity source. It’s amongst the stablecoin pools with the highest base APR due to the trading volume it processes.
* DeFiSaver offers some automation features to streamline Troves management.
* B.Protocol delivered an auto-compounder for depositors of the Stability Pool who wish to keep a 100% LUSD exposure: https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity
* Some protocols, such as Olympus or Fei Protocol diversified part of their treasury to LUSD to shield themselves from volatility with an unstoppable stablecoin. Synthetix is also using LUSD on Optimism to stabilize the sUSD price.

#### LUSD usage

A sizeable share of the LUSD supply (~66%) is deposited into the Stability Pool, the liquidity backstop for liquidations: https://etherscan.io/address/0x66017d22b0f8556afdd19fc67041899eb65a21bb

The top LUSD holders also include other protocols, such as Olympus, DXdao or some treasuries.

LUSD is also present on Optimism, where Synthetix provided a wrapper contract to help stabilize the sUSD price (~45M LUSD) + to provide liquidity on Velodrome (the pool is ~9M TVL, against USDC).

#### LUSD Emission

The only way to mint LUSD is to open a Trove, while LUSD is burned through debt repayment, either directly (by the trove owner) or through redemptions (by an arbitrageur).

#### Token & Protocol Permissions

The LUSD token as well as the whole Liquity protocol are fully permissionless. There is no multisig and no governance, and no-one can interact with the contract underlying the protocol in an administrative manner: all users are the same in front of the contract, just like with Uniswap v2 for instance.

#### Market Data

As of June 03, the total LUSD supply is around 325M. There is about $90M of total liquidity in pools where LUSD is involved.

The main liquidity source for LUSD is the Curve pool with ~$65M TVL: https://curve.fi/lusd

There are also liquidity sources against FRAX, USDC and DAI on Uniswap V3: https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0

There is a 4-tokens pool on Saddle Finance (alUSD, FEI, FRAX, LUSD) with $25M liquidity: https://saddle.exchange/#/pools/D4/deposit

Finally, on Optimism, LUSD is the largest stablecoin pool with around ~$9M against USDC https://app.velodrome.finance/liquidity/0x207addb05c548f262219f6bfc6e11c02d0f7fdbe

The observed volume can vary depending on the market's activity (massive ETH price movements are usually followed by days with large volume), with a baseline around $3M daily volume (mainnet only).

#### Social channel data

The main channel for the community to gather is the Liquity Discord server, with around 6.5K members. For outward-facing communications, the main channel used is the @LiquityProtocol Twitter account with over 28.5K followers. We also regularly publish newsletter updates to subscribers (2.5K) and have recently become more active on LinkedIn (<1K).

Number of transactions on LUSD: 197,461 (+ ~2000 on Optimism)

Number of token holders on LUSD: 4758 (+ ~100 on Optimism)

### Risk Assessment

We followed [Aave's risk assessment methodology](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/methodology) to provide all the necessary metrics:

I'm not sure what the proper rating is for a stablecoin with no governance and immutable code should be when it comes to the ""Permission"" category, so I went with an A to reflect that in that regard, LUSD is almost as safe as ETH. Feel free to challenge me if you think that is not appropriate.

Title: [ARFC] Framework for ARFC and TEMP CHECK Proposals
Author: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative
Date: 2023-06-27
---

## Summary

This framework provides comprehensive guidelines for the Aave DAO community when creating and voting on ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) and TEMP CHECK proposals. It includes a template for crafting proposals and outlines the quorum and voting requirements.

## Motivation

### Distinction Between TEMP CHECK and ARFC

TEMP CHECKs serve as ""temperature checks"" to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.

Conversely, ARFCs are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.

### Proposal Template

Each proposal **must** include the following sections:

A header:
1. **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for the proposal, including the proposal type (ARFC or TEMP CHECK) in a [TAG] format.
2. **Author**: The name of the author and/or entity creating the proposal.
3. **Date**: The date the proposal is being made, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

A proposal body:

1. **Summary**: A succinct summary of the proposal.
2. **Motivation**: A detailed presentation of the proposal and potential benefits for the Aave protocol. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
3. **Specification**: A comprehensive description of the proposed change, including any relevant parameters or risk considerations. For ARFCs, this section should be technical, detailing the specific changes to be made. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
4. **Disclaimer**: Any necessary disclaimers, such as conflicts of interest or third-party involvement.
5. **Next Steps**: The proposed next steps if the proposal is approved.
6. **Copyright**: A statement defining proposal copyright. While Open-Source is **mandatory**, the choice of a specific license is left to the author.

### Voting Guidelines

1. **Vote Start Time**: The vote should commence 24 hours after the proposal is published on Snapshot.
2. **Proposal Age**: The governance thread related to the snapshot vote should be at least 5 days old before voting begins.
3. **Vote Duration**: The vote should last for a minimum of 3 days.
4. **Vote Options**: The vote should have at least three options: YAE (Yes), NAY (No), and ABSTAIN.
5. **Quorum**: The vote should reach a quorum of 320,000 YAE votes.
6. **Differential**: The YAE votes should exceed the second-largest vote option (either NAY or ABSTAIN) by at least 80,000.

### Proposal Cycle:

![image|1920x920](upload://fPsMYVukUCZ2OFHwDUzkFUgc9dw.jpeg)

### Special Considerations

This framework should be considered as a general template for general proposals. Specific proposals and/or frameworks, such as asset onboarding or caps updates, should follow specific guidelines as determined by the Aave DAO community.

This framework is designed to ensure that all proposals are thoroughly considered and that all votes are fair and representative of the Aave DAO community's views.

## Specification

As this proposal pertains to governance guidelines, it does not require any on-chain action or protocol change.

## Disclaimer

The ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.

## Next Steps 

1) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2) If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted.

Boring Security is seeking $239,000 for FY24. We are seeking funds to deploy into a Uniswap V3 Liquidity Pool where Boring Security DAO can take structured withdrawals from yield generated month over month to cover its operating expenses not covered by partnership income and other grants.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

For less than the (former) cost of one Council member per month :trollfaceemoji:, we have a DAO full of almost 30 contributor members and 1600 Alumni token holders, preaching the message of Security, and showcasing the power of ApeCoin. We have expanded the ApeCoin ecosystem beyond just apes, partnering with Gitcoin, Art Blocks, Pudgy Penguins twice, publishing content with Ledger Academy, and building & teaching in the metaverse!

**Boring Security’s OnCyber Classroom:** https://www.oncyber.com/boringsecurity-classroom

## We also will be adding 'Powered by ApeCoin' to all of our materials!
Going forward, we want to make sure the world knows that **we are ApeCoin powered.** Boring Security simply would not be possible without the ApeCoin DAO, and with this proposal we are asking for permission to plaster this on all of our materials.

We may also include other sponsors in parts of our branding as well, but we want folks to be reminded at every step that ApeCoin is at the heart of who we are and what we do. We pay our contributors in ApeCoin, we hodl our ApeCoin, and we provide (some) liquidity to ApeCoin as well.

*A mockup of the Powered by ApeCoin usage*

Boring Security has been incredibly cost effective, being very judicious with every dollar spent. We’re committed to growing Boring Security as part of the ApeCoin DAO, building out an asynchronous catalog of security resources (beyond just articles) in 2024.

Curious about our budget? We have tracked every single transaction the DAO has made, as well as it’s supporting LLC entity, here:

We don’t want to be just a “public good funded by Apes”, but a representation of what a lean, mission driven DAO can accomplish for all of Web3. So far, we’ve focused on expanding our live class offering and growing our community. Next we want to be a household name, helping turn ApeCoin DAO to be the friendliest, most accessible ecosystem in all of crypto. We can’t wait to build in the Otherside along with you all, and send you on quests to defeat scammers in the metaverse!

**Title:** [ARFC] Stablecoin Harmonization and Asset Parameters Optimization 
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-01-03

---
## Simple Summary

This ARFC proposes focusing stablecoin collateral usage on USDT and USDC while setting LTV to zero for less-trafficked stablecoins and long-tail assets. The objective is to minimize risk for the protocol, optimize revenue generation, and align with market demand trends.

## Motivation

Aave's revenue primarily comes from wETH borrowing and stablecoins borrowing. Years of User behavior data in DeFi indicates a low demand for fluctuating assets as collateral except in use-case-specific scenarios (LST/LRT loops for Weth, RPL borrow to deploy mini pools). Based on @ChaosLabs  [data](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Ethereum/listed-assets/), only 2.4%, 3.7%, and 5.8% of supplied DAI, USDT, and USDC on Ethereum are being utilized as collateral. We can also note that market demand for alternative stablecoins is less sensitive to borrow rates compared to blue-chip stablecoins like USDT and USDC.


The DAO governance has been lenient in onboarding some collaterals, such as KNC, which currently attracts nearly zero traction (currently used to generate 0.79$ of borrow volume) and generates minimal revenue. Additionally, the asymmetric risk presented by stablecoins, such as during the CRV event (collateral was USDC with very high LT and low LB), highlights the need for optimization considering Risk/reward.

## Specification

### Proposed Adjustments:

The ACI proposes the following strategy shift:

1. Focus on USDT and USDC as primary stablecoin collaterals.
2. Set LTV to zero for alternative stablecoins and long tail assets.
3. Enable a 3%/week LT reduction for these stablecoins assets, providing ample time for users to react and keep them as passive yield sources or borrowable assets that represent 99% of current user demand and most of protocol revenue.
4. Propose the following adjusted standardized ReserveFactor categories for Aave assets:

| Collateral Type | Reserve Factor % |
| --- | --- |
| wETH | 15% |
| USDC/USDT | 10% |
| Alternative stablecoins & long tail assets | 20% |
| DAI | 25% |

5. Fade out as collateral the following stablecoins: 

- FRAX
- LUSD
- EURS
- agEUR
- JEUR
- MAI

6. freeze (if not already), then slowly offboard the following alternative stablecoins and long-tail assets that failed to gain traction by gradually increasing RF to 99.9%, decreasing LT by 3% per week then applying incremental interestRateStrategies incentivizing users to switch to others collaterals or borrowed asset as the DAO implemented for BUSD and TUSD on Aave V2:

| Collateral Type          | Network      |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| EURS                    | All pools     |
| agEUR                   | All pools     |
| JEUR                    | All pools     |
| MAI                      | All pools    |
| KNC                     | Ethereum     |
| STG                     | Ethereum     |
| BAL                     | All pools    |
| FXS                     | Ethereum     |
| UNI                     | Ethereum     |
| WBTC.e                  | Avalanche      |


## Next Steps

1. Community feedback and gather consensus on the proposed adjustments.
2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.
3. If successful, escalate to AIP stage.

Title: [ARFC] Add gmETH on Arbitrum V3
Discussions: [[TEMP CHECK] Add gmETH on Arbitrum V3](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-gmbtc-on-arbitrum-v3/16392?u=saucyblock)
Author: @0xlide - @SaucyBlock 
Date: 2024-02-05

## Summary
This publication presents the community an opportunity to add gmETH on the Arbitrum Aave v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Motivation
GMX Protocol is the largest DEX offering derivatives and one of the most popular DeFi’s today. The introduction of several new features and integration with Chainlink Data Stream in GMX V2 has significantly reduced the risks of front-running and price manipulation compared to GMX V1. gmETH is a ETH-USD's Liquidity Token on the GMX V2 and earn fees from leverage trading, borrowing fees and swaps. 

Integrating gmETH as collateral asset in the Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool has the potential to create new demand for borrowable assets on Aave V3.

Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.

Proposal: About Metis
Born out of the need for permissionless and open collaboration, Metis Andromeda is an EVM Equivalent Ethereum Layer 2. MetisDAO Foundation is building a hub for the Web3 economy in 3 stages: an Ethereum Layer 2 providing top-notch scalability; built-in on-chain credentials through Nuvo, providing countless capabilities previously just available for Web2 and traditional finance; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework facilitating the transition of Web2 onto Web3, and enabling Web3 and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain. All the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.

Andromeda network utilizes an upgraded Optimistic Rollup architecture, allowing for high throughput while maintaining Ethereum’s underlying security. Currently, Metis is a Stage 0 Rollup, according to Vitalik’s proposed categorization framework. Metis Andromeda is a first-of-its-kind Smart L2. The concept of the Smart L2 explores the design space in between Rollups and Plasma architectures, combining rollup’s security with plasma’s scalability. Learn more about the Metis Smart L2. Our L2 is not where our vision ends, per se; our L2 is a means to the end of building an open collaboration framework to host the Web3 economy. This is the foundational base layer that will allow further developments and rollout of the next business verticals.

Our second vertical is Nuvo, a Web3 identity system providing infrastructure to mint and use non-transferable NFTs and toolkits for on-chain credentials: portable and composable credentials earned through on-chain achievements and history. Soulbound tokens will allow and enable no-coin governance, establishing provenance, decentralized key management, souldrops, and countless Web2 functionalities that weren’t previously available for Web3. Nuvo also offers a state-of-the-art cross-chain wallet, enabling account abstraction and several benefits for users. These features will help the ecosystem realize and embody its goals of decentralization, secure its long-term health, and make it the perfect setting for Web2 organizations looking to transition into Web3 without facing a substantial UI change.

Third, Koris: tooling and infrastructure for DAOs, and soon, seamless onboarding of Web2 to Web3 through our Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework. Koris provides tooling and infrastructure for DAOs to perform their day-to-day operations in a more efficient manner and will allow Web2 organizations to create and tailor DACs to their preference.

When combining all these components, Metis Andromeda will create a framework for open, decentralized, and trustless collaboration between individuals, dApps, and Web2 organizations transitioning to Web3. All the functionalities enabled by on-chain credentials, the scalability provided by the base Layer 2, and the tooling provided by Koris’ operational system. The perfect suite for dApps, Web2 platforms, or any builder.

MetisDAO Foundation announced earlier this month its upcoming transition to a Hybrid Rollup, either late 2023, or early 2024. This architecture will combine the EVM Compatibility and fast transaction confirmation of Optimistic Rollups, with the censorship-resistance, security, and fast transaction finality enabled by zero-knowledge proofs. Logically, this will be a huge step to secure the Decentralized Finance applications of the network, and provide a very robust base layer for the Web3 Economy.

Committed to supporting our ecosystem builders and seeing them succeed, MetisDAO Foundation can fund projects in 3 main ways:
Builder Mining Rewards
Ecosystem Grants 
Genesi DAC Investments
*The Builder Mining Reward (BMR) program distributes 4000 METIS tokens each month based on how many txs out of the monthly total each protocol is responsible for (eg. if a protocol is responsible for 10% of the network txs, the protocol would receive 400 METIS that month as part of our sustainability grants / retroactive funding practices).

As we build the path towards a Web3 economy, it is crucial to establish strong and long-lasting decentralized finance foundations. A trusted and established money market such as Aave is a key foundational piece to building up strong capital markets in support of the Web3 economy we are building towards. Through this integration, Aave can also obtain additional revenue through protocol fees as well as through the Metis Builder Mining Program. 

Metis envisions and builds towards a rollup-centric future on Ethereum, and seeks to invite Aave to be part of this mission and enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a strong DeFi ecosystem, and there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, but having a Flagship protocol like Aave has always been our end goal in the realm of money markets. The deployment would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while also complementing Aave’s multichain expansion. 
Technical Evaluation by BGD
In the spirit of security and transparency, Metis worked alongside BGD (Bored Ghosts Developing) to perform a technical evaluation on the Andromeda network. The evaluation consisted of 13 categories, with 4 different possible scores: Optimal, Good, Acceptable, and Needs Improvement. Each of the categories scored as follows:

Oracle Infrastructure: Optimal
Blockchain Explorer: Good
Compatibility with Ethereum RPC standard: Optimal
Compatibility with Ethereum account format (addresses): Optimal
RPC public endpoints and providers: Acceptable
Custom behavior (lack of) the execution layer: Optimal
Support of wallet providers: Good
On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Good
Transactions simulation infrastructure (fork): Good
Chain data/indexing solutions: Acceptable
Bridging infrastructure: asset, messages: Optimal
Commitment in security-incidents: Optimal
Network security/technical model: Good

*RPC public endpoints and providers: We integrated Bware services in order to increase the variety of RPC alternatives in the network. We are also in talks with other top tier providers to further bolster our RPC infrastructure. We were in communication with BGD throughout this process to ensure the providers we chose met their technical standards.
*Chain data/indexing solutions: We’re currently finalizing talks with a top data indexing platform in order to enable the right tooling and services in the ecosystem.

Risk Parameter Setting and Asset Listing with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet
Gauntlet and Chaos Labs collaborated to provide a risk analysis and recommendations for the deployment of the Metis Andromeda network. We will follow the recommendations of these trusted risk parties for Aave, for setting both the risk parameters as well as the assets to be listed. 

https://governance.aave.com/t/launch-aave-v3-on-metis/7056/61?u=metis


Incentivized Adoption

We are excited to propose a 100,000 Metis token liquidity incentivization campaign throughout a six month period shortly following deployment. We will be working with Chaos Labs to map out the most strategic allocation of these incentives to bolster strong market depth and sticky liquidity, ensuring to follow best industry practices and monitoring the efficacy in real time.


Next Steps

Assuming a passed deployment vote, we will coordinate with BGD to begin the Aave deployment process and implementation. We expect this process to take roughly four weeks. After the subsequent launch of Aave V3 on Metis, we will monitor the activity and launch the aforementioned liquidity mining incentive program. We will continue to stay in close communication with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet to keep a watchful eye on liquidity levels and inflows, to ensure proposed increases in market caps, congruent with increased liquidity depth on-chain. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with and provide value to both the Aave DAO and community at large, as well as the entire Metis ecosystem.",neutral

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard sUSDe to Aave V3 on Ethereum 
Author: Ethena & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-03-04

---

### **Summary**

[Ethena](http://Ethena.fi) is seeking community support for adding sUSDe to Aave V3 on Ethereum.

### **Motivation**

[Ethena](http://Ethena.fi) is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that will provide a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated savings instrument - the 'Internet Bond'.

Ethena's synthetic dollar, USDe, provides a stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. USDe is fully collateralized and free to compose throughout DeFi.

*USDe* peg stability is ensured through the use of delta hedging derivatives positions against protocol-held collateral.

sUSDe is the staked version of USDe which earns yield from the protocol.

USDe has already seen extensive use throughout DeFi, making this an interesting asset to onboard to Aave v3.

For example, liquidity on Curve is already over >100m:

* https://dune.com/hildobby/ethena
* https://dune.com/hodlduck/ethena-rank
* https://dune.com/noxiousq/ethena-usde

USDe is currently the 4th highest volume asset in the whole of Ethereum behind ETH, USDC, USDT: https://app.uniswap.org/explore

There are also many synergies between USDe and GHO. The GHOTHENA pool is currently the deepest liquidity pool for GHO on chain and Ethena is looking to build a cooperative relationship to grow together.

Because of sUSDe’s high yield, it is expected that its addition as collateral will create strong borrow demand for looping strategies similar to sDAI.

### Specification

*USDe* derives its peg stability from executing automated and programmatic delta-neutral hedges with respect to the underlying collateral assets.

Hedging the price change risk of the collateral asset in the same size ensures the change in value of the collateral asset is offset by the change in value of the hedging leg.

This ensures the synthetic USD value of the collateral remains relatively stable in all market conditions.

Considering the recent launch of sUSDe and current scaling plans, further proposals will suggest conservative LTVs and borrow caps in order to thoughtfully scale sUSDe as collateral.

**Key Information**

* Users are able to acquire USDe in permissionless external liquidity pools.
* Approved parties from permitted jurisdictions who pass KYC/KYB screening are able to **mint** & **redeem** *USDe* on-demand with Ethena Labs contracts directly which will include only market making entities.
* There is no reliance upon traditional banking infrastructure as trustless collateral is held and stored within the crypto-system. *USDe* is fully backed by users' deposits at all times.
* Users are also able to complete Cross Market Arbitrage by **minting & redeeming** *USDe* with Ethena and trading *USDe* in external markets such as Binance or Curve pools to capture price dislocations.

**Risks**

The protocol is exposed to [various risks](notion://www.notion.so/ethena-labs/solution-overview/risks) including but not limited to:

* Smart Contract Risk
* External Platform Risk
* Liquidity Risk
* Custodial Operational Risk
* Exchange Counterparty Risk
* Market Risk

82,"#### ABSTRACT

In production since May 2021, BORED AS F*CK is a feature length documentary directed by Francis Bored Apela (BAYC #9081) that tells the comprehensive story of the Bored Ape Yacht Club and the ever evolving world of web3. We’re industry veterans who aped into BAYC a few weeks after mint to tell its story using the very IP that granted us membership into the club. A movie about NFTs directed by an NFT. Today we’re seeking a community grant from the ApeCoin DAO to support the film in our final stages of production / post-production.

####  BENEFITS TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:

The biggest benefit to the $APE ecosystem is to provide awareness and education through an easily accessible, fun and entertaining documentary that is designed for a broad audience - not just the ones who already know and live in the space. This will be a documentary that can be enjoyed by web3 maxis and non-crypto people alike.

Additionally, we plan to offer additional content, host events, and create merchandise and other collectibles associated with the film that can be purchased/minted with $APE. We will have a ton of additional footage that will be left on the cutting room floor, and we plan to make this available in the form of extended interviews, deleted scenes, and behind the scenes content that can either be purchased directly with $APE or live behind a token gate that can be accessed by anyone that has at least one $APE in their wallet.

Our hope is that a large number of non-crypto people will see the movie on traditional platforms and will be motivated to seek out more information and explore the ecosystem that we showcase in the film.

####  OVERALL COST

$400,000 USD paid in $APE

84,"## Summary

Chaos Labs proposes an amendment to our current scope of work and compensation structure accordingly. Chaos Labs is requesting a $400,000 increase, bringing our total annual compensation to $2M.

## Motivation

In November 2023, Chaos Labs’ engagement with Aave DAO was [unanimously renewed](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/360/), underscoring our ongoing commitment and the expanded scope of our engagement with Aave, which has evolved significantly with Aave's expansion now across over 10 deployments.

This renewal was done during the bear market, prompting us to propose a community-friendly deal at a lower-than-market cost, given the challenging market conditions and being mindful of the broader economic environment. This was aligned with the feedback from major Aave stakeholders and delegates. However, the expansion of Aave to multiple chains, in addition to the increased volatility and activity across DeFi and crypto, has significantly increased our scope and workload, necessitating additional resources to maintain the high level of service required. 

As dedicated risk contributors, Chaos Labs adopts a holistic approach to managing the spectrum of responsibilities within Aave's ecosystem, including V3, GHO, and the continued offboarding of V2. Our commitment encompasses risk management, data science, analytics, and parameter recommendation, among other critical functions. An amendment to our compensation is essential to reflect better the resources committed, the depth of our engagement, and the substantial value we bring to the Aave community.

Considering improved market conditions and Aave’s growth over the past several months, we believe the DAO is now in a position to revise our compensation to more accurately reflect the current scale and impact of our engagement and allocated resources.

### Enhancing Aave's Risk Management Framework

The proposed compensation amendment is not merely a financial adjustment but a continued investment in our collaboration. With additional funding, Chaos Labs will be poised to:

- **Deploy Additional Resources:** Enhance support for existing and future Aave markets, ensuring comprehensive risk management across all deployments.
- **Develop and Optimize Risk Oracles:** Focus efforts on the continued development of the Chaos Risk Oracle specifically for Aave’s needs, enabling more efficient and dynamic risk parameter adjustments. This will further streamline the risk management process, reducing the need for manual interventions and significantly boosting the protocol's operational efficiency and security.
- **Expansion of Risk Monitoring and Alerts:** Our real-time monitoring and alert services are delivered via the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). We're committed to enriching these services with more comprehensive analytics and alerts, enhancing visibility and enabling users to meticulously evaluate ecosystem risks and the health of the protocol through intuitive dashboards and data visualizations. The deployment of Risk Oracles will introduce additional data, providing the community with an improved grasp of risk levels and updates to protocol parameters.

### Collaborative Expansion with a Second Risk Service Provider

Following Gauntlet's resignation as the second-risk service provider, we strongly support the idea of bringing on another service provider to complement our existing scope of work. As part of our engagement, we are committed to dedicating the required resources to assist with the onboarding process and ongoing collaborations, ensuring a seamless integration that enhances Aave's risk management capabilities without duplicating efforts.

### Conclusion

The requested compensation amendment is key for Chaos Labs to sustain and expand its support for Aave. It will enable us to allocate additional resources effectively, develop innovative solutions like the Risk Oracle, and continue our mission to enhance Aave's security and efficiency. We are committed to our partnership with Aave and believe that with the community's support, we can continue setting the standards for risk management in the industry.

## Specification:

We request an additional $400K for the remainder of our current engagement, bringing the total annual compensation to $2M. 

If this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0) as the recipient.

In terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 400,000 aUSDC or GHO. 

## Disclaimer:

Chaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and more. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.

This proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.

85,"## Summary
A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V3 AVAX. 

## Motivation

We recommend the following borrow caps for the Aave V3 AVAX Market. Borrow caps help prevent against high-risk attack vectors while sacrificing little capital efficiency. Our simulation analyses show that these borrow caps for these assets reduce the likelihood of market manipulation while allowing for natural organic borrow demand. As these markets naturally grow, we can continue to reassess raising caps incrementally.  

- FRAX borrow_cap: 2,000,000
- MAI borrow_cap: 2,000,000
- LINK borrow_cap: 220,000

## Specification

Set borrow caps on FRAX, MAI, and LINK on Aave V3 AVAX.

86,"Title: [TEMP CHECK] - Whitelist Stargate for V3 Portals

Author: Stargate

Date: 2023-03-24

## Proposal

Stargate is a fully composable liquidity transport protocol that lives at the heart of DeFi. Users can utilize Stargate to transfer value between various supported blockchains taking advantage of guaranteed finality for their transfers, low fees and deep liquidity. Developers can enable omnichain experiences within their products by utilizing Stargate’s deep liquidity and easy composability.

Stargate operates using only native assets across each of the eight chains it supports (Ethereum, Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Fantom and Metis). Users will always receive native assets when interacting with Stargate, getting rid of the need for wrapped assets or IOUs of value. Stargate has helped facilitate over $4,500,000,000 of value transferred by over 1,000,000 transactions within the first year since launch.

Portals are an ideal fit for Stargate as it combines one of the most used and liquid third party bridges that has a strong track record of moving value with one of the most respected protocols and communities of users in Aave. Stargate would enable Aave users to reliably and safely access assets on a variety of chains in a secure and trusted manner.

Stargate would like to request a credit line for USDC, USDT and ETH to help Aave users access these assets in a multi-chain world.

## Technical Specifications
Stargate operates with deep pools of capital on each chain it resides on. Currently there is over $325,000,000 of value within Stargate that facilitates hundreds of millions of dollars of monthly volume and tens of thousands of monthly users. Over its lifetime, Stargate has helped over 1,000,000 users move over $4,500,000,000 of value and growing.

These pools of capital allow users and developers to move value between supported chains in a predictable and reliable way. When this is combined with Stargate’s Instant Guaranteed Finality 1 it means that a transfer always completes on the destination chain with the intended amount. There is never a case where you get wrapped tokens or some notional representation of value. This is incredibly important for Portals as it guarantees that all unbacked aTokens will be repaid in a predictable and guaranteed way.

To support portals, a user would simply have to deposit a supported asset (USDC, USDT or ETH) and select the destination chain where they want to receive the asset from Aave. Stargate would then use a LayerZero message to release the asset on the destination chain from Aave, giving it to the requesting user. At the same time the underlying native asset would be simultaneously bridged via Stargate’s traditional, battle tested liquidity transfer mechanism based on the pools of capital within the protocol. When this transfer completes, the native assets would be used to repay the outstanding debt from the Aave aTokens Stargate was lent to facilitate the transfer. 

![c8c39318ca95bad03b284bbc5d0686e501feefd4_2_1035x369.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreidceffrxyjlnke5g5llx4qligsusifjopa4dzwdbry2dy6xljqmti)
    
Stargate is built on top of LayerZero. LayerZero is a lightweight universal messaging interface that allows developers to seamlessly interact with contracts across dozens of blockchains. LayerZero Endpoints rely on an innovative architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and independent Oracles and Relayers to securely relay messages between chains.

 
![8f67c0c0d823a501d5e7a1d73a1f6f674c84eb20_2_1035x415.png](ipfs://bafkreig3qzjidrciod6le7ttgiob4xaf5l3c6pt7xahy35gajps4vrznlu)
*Communication flow in a single LayerZero cross-chain transaction.*

In a single call, paying only source gas, users and protocols can send a message (or a bundle of messages) to contracts on any supported chain. Stargate uses this messaging to facilitate the movement of value (stable coins, ETH and other assets) between the eight chains it supports. These chains are Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Fantom, Polygon, Avalanche and Metis.

* Can anyone provide liquidity to the protocol?

Yes

* Is liquidity incentivized?

Partially, Stargate owns a portion of the liquidity within the protocol, providing predictable, evergreen underlying liquidity to the protocol and incentivizes the remaining liquidity

* Is there a fee model for participants?

Stargate currently charges 6 basis points per transfer plus the cost of the gas associated with sending the transaction through the LayerZero network

* Does the entity is or is planning to provide available liquidity into Aave protocol?

Stargate currently is exploring research ideas around depositing idle liquidity into Aave

* Link to technical documentation

https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/

## Credit Line Request
Stargate would like to request credit lines for the blockchains where both it and Aave exist. These are Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, and Fantom. We understand Portals will start primarily between ETH and the layer 2 ecosystems (Arbitrum and Optimism) so would like to request credit lines there first, with the ability to scale to the other chains as Aave scales Portals. This way Stargate can grow with Aave as a partner.

|Network|Asset|Current Liquidity (USD)|Current 30D volume (USD)|Requested credit Line|Fee Model|Fee requested|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|All|USDC|90.2M|242M|1M per chain|Fixed|6 bps|
|All|USDT|54.3M|100M|1M per chain|Fixed|6 bps|
|All|ETH|22.7M|68M|1M per chain|Fixed|6 bps|

## Incentives
An incentive program may be approved by the Stargate DAO after the proposal is approved. The Stargate Foundation will recommend that the Stargate DAO give 2 bps of every transaction to the Aave DAO to help align economic incentives and create a deeper partnership between the two communities.

## Audits & Security
* List of relevant security audits of the network

Stargate both internally and externally audits all code that is shipped for the protocol. Stargate works with external auditors like Zellic, Ottersec, and Ackee to ensure user funds are always safe.

A list of audits can be found here: https://github.com/stargate-protocol/stargate/tree/main/audit

Stargate also utilizes LayerZero’s PreCrime solution to ensure that it never loses a single unit of user funds. Pre-Crime takes an outbound transaction and makes sure that it’s legitimate by running it against a set of application-defined invariants before the delivery of each message. Pre-Crime first forks every chain locally then it runs the state transaction locally to make sure the resulting state meets the list of defined invariants the application sets. Once this is confirmed Pre-Crime then provides an attestation that this is a legitimate transfer and the message is delivered.

87,"# Summary

Stader proposes addition of MaticX as collateral to Aave v3 Polygon market. Here’s why Matic X will be a strong addition to the Aave v3 Polygon market:

## About Staderlabs

MaticX is built by Staderlabs, a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider with ~900mn $ in assets with 40k+ users staking with us across Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera

## About MaticX

a. MaticX is an ERC20 token that represents the user’s staked assets and accrued rewards. Matic X increases in value relative to Matic as staking rewards accrue
b. MaticX has been audited by top security audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes

## Liquidity for MaticX

a. MaticX has high liquidity on Polygon, with ~3.7 mn$ of liquidity for our Matic <> MaticX pool on Quickswap, within days of LP launch. LPs on more DEXs coming in the next couple of weeks

## Benefits to AAVE and Polygon

a. With MaticX, Matic holders can participate in both staking and Defi, unlocking new liquidity from staking for Defi, including Aave
b. Matic holders will be able to promote decentralization of Polygon by staking with multiple high performing validators
c. We expect staking participation of the community to increase as we launch a solution to stake directly on the Polygon mainnet in the coming fortnight


## Proposed parameters for MaticX

a. Max LTV has 55%
b. Liquidation threshold of 60-65%
c. Liquidation penalty of 10-15%
Background about Stader

StaderLabs 2 is a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider. We are live on 4 blockchains including Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera.

Within a few months of launch, Stader has more than 900 Mn USD of total assets staking on the platform.

~$850 M+ Luna staked
$65 M+ HBAR staked
Over 40k+ users staking with Stader smart contracts

## Adding MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon market

MaticX is an ERC20 token that represents a user’s share of the staked Matic assets with Stader. It is a token that increases in price as the staked MATIC accrues staking rewards and these rewards are compounded i.e. MaticX simply becomes more expensive over time relative to MATIC.

Safety and security are paramount for Stader and we do multiple audits of our smart contracts to safeguard user’s funds. MaticX contracts have been audited twice by reputed audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes. Here are the links to the two Audit Reports: Report 1 & Report 2.

You can explore Stader’s Liquid Staking for Polygon by going over to the Stader Dapp: https://polygon.staderlabs.com/liquid-staking/maticx 1

MaticX is available on Polygonscan at the address: `0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6`

## MaticX Liquidity Pools

The MaticX <> Matic LP is live on Quickswap
LP size ~3.7 Mn USD (within a few days)

Expect to significantly increase with dual rewards available for the pool. We are launching staking on the Polygon Mainnet in a few days and this will amplify the MaticX TVL and the LP size manifold (Polygon’s staking protocol is native to Ethereum, so Stader Polygon v1 only supports staking Matic on Ethereum.)

We will also be creating LPs, and incentivising them across other Polygon DEXs

## Benefits to Polygon & Aave Community

We believe MaticX will be a great addition to Aave v3 Polygon markets as it will unlock several borrowing use cases including leveraged staking, borrowing other assets with MaticX and potentially several DeGen strategies.

Stader’s selection of validators is transparent (here 2) and centered around generating highest staking returns for delegators and encouraging decentralization of Polygon.

High performing validators (100% of last 200 checkpoints, >98% checkpoints in last 90 days)
Commissions (<=5%)
Preference to lower voting power

We expect MaticX to continue to grow in demand as we integrate across more ecosystem partners and also increase overall staking participation in Polygon (currently only 14,000 wallets of total of 140m active wallets stake on Polygon). Aave would be one of the first protocols to offer significant lending offerings for MaticX driving a lot of Matic community to Aave.

## Parameters

Based on the updated WMATIC risk parameters, we propose the following risk parameters for MaticX as MaticX is backed by Matic staked via Stader’s contract.

Max LTV of 55% for MaticX (compared to 65% for WMATIC)
Liquidation threshold of 60-65% for MaticX (compared to 70% for WMATIC)
Liquidation penalty of 10-15% for MaticX (compared to 10% for WMATIC)
We would like to hear feedback and update any specific information/ parameters as suggested by the Polygon and Aave community.

## Update (July 1, 2022)

Adding a small section to update on all the developments from the time of original proposal being published.

Traction: More than 13 million Matic by 1.4k+ unique wallets already staked with Stader for MaticX. We launched the ability for Polygon community to stake directly on Polygon in early May without having to bridge to Ethereum enabling cheaper, faster transactions and have seen strong adoption

Liquidity: We have ~10 mn $ in liquidity across DEXs, with a ~5.4 mn $ on Balancer metastable pool (suited for low slippage) On Polygon, currently in Top 2 pools by liquidity size on Balancer Polygon

Chainlink price feed: Our calculated price feed for MaticX from Chainlink is in testing phase and expected to be live in the week starting July 11

Defi and Lending: On lending, we have ~1 mn $ of MaticX already being lent on Polygon Defi (primarily on Meshswap single sided lending). We have also forged strong partnerships across Polygon Defi, including
a) Balancer Labs, Quickswap, Meshswap in DEXs,
b) Beefy Finance, Autofarm, Harvest Finance in yield optimizers, Meshswap and
c) Meshswap, Market XYZ in lending
MaticX can be redeemed for the underlying Matic with an unbonding period of ~3 days (80 checkpoints as per Polygon native staking contract) mitigating depeg risks
Look forward to bringing MaticX to the AAVE and Polygon communities.

Note: Stader’s overall now stands around 50 mn $ compared to the 900 mn $ at the time of original proposal due to the unfortunate Terra crash, where a large % of our TVL was.

As with stETH and sAVAX, this proposal recommends listing maticX with borrowing disabled.

Comments

Having recently obtained a Chainlink oracle, maticX can be listed on Aave v3 on Polygon. maticX can be added as collateral in Isolation Mode with a Supply Cap in place. A Supply Cap of around $6M is suggested which represents half the market capitalisation of maticX on Polygon and also approximately the value of a trade with 5% price impact via 1inch’s aggregator at the time of writing. The Supply Cap should be revised to prevailing liquidity conditions.

The initial listing risks parameters for maticX are the same as those proposed for stMATIC with a revised lower supply cap reflecting the lower liquidity profile.

Given users may recursively strategy of depositing maticX, borrowing matic, swapping/staking it for maticX and then depositing maticX into Aave’s lending pool again, an E-Mode should be created between maticX and MATIC. The Supply Cap is intended to ensure there sufficient maticX liquidity remains across decentralised exchanges, as the strategy has the effect of transferring liquidity from exchange liquidity pools into lending pools. With a calculated oracle, the risk of being liquidated is lower and therefore it is expected the leverage strategies will be more aggressively pursued than the stETH strategy on Aave v2 on Ethereum.

The following Isolation and Efficiency Mode parameters would be a good starting place based upon current market conditions:

88,"The aim of this proposal is to create lotteries with bigger potential gains and burn more cake in the long run.
The adjustments i suggest are that: 

. - All ranks get an equal weight pay out. (13.3% of cake goes to each rank)
- Cake only gets burned when it flows in to the lottery.
-Cake stays in its rank till it's won, no redistribution if rank 5 or 6 did not got won.


Point 1 will have the result that if you buy 10 tickets and win in the first rank you will get around 80% of your cake back.

Point 2 and 3 will result in prizepools that are worth to be won and worth to take the risk to play the lottery. More people who want to play should result in more cake being burned.

In case i'm wrong and after 3 weeks or so you see a reduction in cake being burned you could raise the burn upon entry to 30 or 40% from the current 20.",bullish

title: [ARFC] Set Metis Foundation Wallet as Emission Manager for METIS Token on Aave V3 Metis Pool
author: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative
date: 2023-07-05
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes to set the Metis Foundation wallet as the emission manager for the METIS token on the Aave V3 Metis pool. This will enable the Metis Foundation to define and fund incentive programs for this Aave pool, promoting growth and expanding the user base of this new Aave V3 market.

## Motivation

The Metis Foundation has expressed a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3 Metis pool. By setting their wallet as the emission manager for the METIS token, the Foundation will be able to directly fund incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets.

## Specification

The Metis Foundation wallet address is as follows:

Emission Admin Wallet (Metis Foundation): `0x97177cD80475f8b38945c1E77e12F0c9d50Ac84D`

The AIP call setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract.

`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(METIS, EMISSION_ADMIN);`

This method will set the Metis Foundation wallet as the emission admin for the METIS token.

**Title:** [ARFC] Emission Manager Framework Update 
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-03-08

---
## Motivation

In the current market dynamic, with incentives programs becoming increasingly popular among protocols looking to collaborate, the existing framework for adding new emission managers to Aave pool reserves is considered unnecessary complex and lengthy. Given the general consensus in favor of incentives programs, it is challenging to consider a proposal that would fail to gain community support.

The current onboarding process involves:

| Step | Duration | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Publish ARFC on forum | 5 days | Seek feedback from the community |
| Snapshot vote | 4 days | Gather consensus and obtain a YAE outcome |
| AIP publication | 5 days | Reach consensus and implement the new role |

Assuming perfect sync and seamless governance, this minimum two-week timeframe is deemed inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose updating the framework to incorporate emission admins into the ""Direct-to-AIP"" framework.

## Specification

### Proposed Changes:

1. Incorporate emission admins into the ""Direct-to-AIP"" framework, enabling direct escalation of proposals to the AIP stage following publication on the forum.
2. Pre-authorize the inclusion of an emission admin as part of either an ad-hoc steward or current risk steward role to facilitate a more efficient and streamlined onboarding process.

## Next Steps

1. Community feedback and gather consensus on the proposed changes.
2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.
3. If successful, escalate to AIP (Aave Improvement Proposal) stage for implementation.

## Disclaimer

This proposal is made independently by the ACI.

94,"Users of AAVE that lend and borrow pegged assets are at a higher risk of liquidation than justified due to the implementation of the oracle. I propose that prices for stablecoin assets be calculated by making use of lower variance price feeds. This proposal would be limited to USDC, USDT, and DAI for now, but could expand if Chainlink adds more price feeds. 

Background:
The prices of assets in AAVE, and by extension the debt ratio, are calculated by Chainlink oracles which convert all asset prices directly to ETH (which are converted in the frontend to a dollar price). Chainlink price feeds to ETH are designed to update only when the price deviates from the previous price by 1% or more. This means that your debt ratio can rise by about 2% simply by random chance. This is not to mention the fact that Chainlink may update different price feeds at different blocks creating a further divergence in debt ratio.

The Proposal:
When the relevant price feeds are available and can be considered reliable, convert assets to their pegged equivalents before converting the price to ETH. Because the variance of the USD to ETH price calculation would be shared by all USD pegged assets that supported the feed, the debt ratio between pegged assets would only be affected by the variance of the asset's price around the peg.

Before:
USDC -> ETH
USDT -> ETH

After:
USDC -> USD -> ETH
USDT -> USD -> ETH

95,"## **Proposal Motivation**

We at [she256](https://twitter.com/she_256) are submitting this proposal to the community for the deployment of Uniswap v3 on Base, upon Base mainnet launch.

Base is an open-source, developer-friendly L2 EVM blockchain, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. Base is being incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase's onchain products and an open ecosystem for permissionless development. Coinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launching of Base to help realize the [Optimism superchain vision](https://app.optimism.io/superchain). Base testnet is currently live, with docs available at [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/), and the mainnet launch is tentatively scheduled for summer 2023.

Base is aiming to have day-one support for Uniswap v3. We believe there is strong potential for Base to generate high TVL and mobilize an influx of new users to Uniswap because of (1) Base's plan to natively integrate with Coinbase products, which have tens of millions of users, (2) the 50+ dapps/protocols that have committed to deploying on Base, and (3) good signal around initial usage of the Base testnet.

## **Base, Optimism, and How Uniswap Benefits**

### **Optimism and The Superchain Thesis**

Optimism is the [second largest Ethereum L2 by virtue of TVL and volume](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl), created with the purpose of helping Ethereum scale. Built using the OP Stack, Optimism relies on a fraud-proof scheme to reliably submit batched transactions to Ethereum L1. For the past ~two years, Ethereum's modular structure has gained tremendous traction from users due to more favorable txn speed and lower network costs. However, L2s are in and of themselves silos. The limitations of cross-chain interactions between different monolithic chains are apparent–but such issues, albeit to a lesser degree, are still present on rollups. For instance, the execution layers for the most popular L2s remain separate, with the shared aspect being a common layer for consensus, settlement, and data availability, the Ethereum L1. This is where the [Superchain](https://www.optimism.io/superchain) thesis comes into play, aiming to create a standardized architecture for L2 development.

The OP Stack is currently undergoing a significant scalability improvement by introducing the concept of a Superchain. This new system will create a network of chains that share various features such as bridging, upgrades, decentralized governance, and a communication layer, all of which will be built on the existing OP Stack. The goal of this new system is to merge the current Optimism Mainnet and other chains–built using the OP Stack–into a single unified network of OP Chains, thereby taking a significant step towards bringing scalable and decentralized compute to the world. The Superchain currently stands as an ideal in the development phase, not a materialized product. Developing a robust system of OP Chains is likely to take a couple of years.

As the Superchain vision takes hold, it will strive to integrate siloed L2s into an interoperable and composable system, allowing for seamless communication between individual chains built using the OP Stack as well as a simplistic process for developing L2s, with the backend complexities being abstracted from developers' purview. Commoditizing the nature of L2s frees builders to concentrate on perfecting the specific value proposition of their chain as opposed to meddling with the overhead that arises with constructing blockchains from scratch. The OP Stack enables for a more plug-and-play system where builders can incorporate specific ""modules"" for customizing their chains. Individual OP Chains will have the ability to select their customized data availability module, while simultaneously remaining connected to the other swath of OP Chains which may have opted in for an alternative data availability module. Hence, the Superchain is a healthy blend between a shared, standardized development architecture and a robust set of individualizing modules for the specific aspirations of individual OP Chains.

### **Coinbase and The Rise of Base**

[Coinbase has joined](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/2jk3D1Y8-hid8YOCUUa6yXmsyzNCYYyFJP0Nhaey9x0) as both a core developer of the OP Stack and a new L2 chain built on the OP codebase through its deployment of Base. As a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective's mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.

The collaboration's immediate goal is to upgrade Optimism Mainnet, Base, and other L2s to an initial Superchain structure with shared bridging and sequencing. In the long term, the shared vision is for the Superchain to become a vast network that maximizes interoperability, shares decentralized protocols, standardizes core primitives, and funds the public goods that make it all possible.

Base is an Ethereum L2 network striving to offer a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly environment for building onchain dapps, using the open-source OP Optimism stack. In pursuit of this goal, Base will serve as both a home for Coinbase's onchain products as well as an open platform for any developers to permissionlessly contribute towards. Development on Base in general will require a source for liquidity provision, and as is the case with the other L2s, Uniswap composes the largest portion of that market.

[Four key principles](https://base.mirror.xyz/jjQnUq_UNTQOk7psnGBFOsShi7FlrRp8xevQUipG_Gk) have shaped Base that will also continue to guide its approach:

1. **Bridges \> Islands.** Base is being designed to facilitate easy and secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, and other L1 ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. As a bridge for users into the cryptoeconomy, it will provide an easy-to-use, default onchain experience with access to products on other chains. Coinbase intends to initiate Base to be interoperable with other chains while continuing to support as many chains as possible across the Coinbase product suite.

2. **Open-source.** As Base is built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack, it is freely available and fully open source. Coinbase is joining as the second core dev team working on the OP Stack, ensuring it is a public good available to everyone. This toolkit is an open platform that anyone can contribute to, fork, and extend to help the cryptoeconomy scale.

3. **Decentralization**. Decentralization is essential for the cryptoeconomy to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone. With the increased resources that Coinbase brings to the OP Stack, Base is expected to progress from a [Stage 0 to Stage 1](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1609209529706872833?s=20) rollup in 2023–and to a [Stage 2 rollup](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571) in 2024.

4. **Robust.** Base aims to be an open ecosystem initially bootstrapped with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life, and counts a significant group of Day 0 builders and projects that will contribute to making Base a robust ecosystem.

As highlighted in the [Mulitchain Uniswap](https://blog.uniswap.org/multichain-uniswap) blog post, we share the belief that users ""should access Web3 on chains with properties that are important to them."" Since Base's core goal is to provide a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly L2 environment for building onchain dapps we feel it fitting for Uniswap to be live from day-one. The potential for Uniswap to capture the inflow of new users from the off-chain world is a promising opportunity for the DEX to reach a new audience. As of December 2023, Coinbase had nearly [$80B of assets under custody, 80% higher](https://messari.io/report/pump-up-the-base) than the onchain TVL at the time. Across v2 and v3, Uniswap only has [$4B in TVL](https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap).

### Developers and Ecosystem

There has been strong initial engagement with developers on Base. In its first week, Base saw [18K developers deploy 55K smart contracts](https://base.mirror.xyz/rA5v_0BTc5AwmZdnui7ku82FzF1aTE6TJ_3vds9ymBc) on testnet. Since the Base testnet launch on 2.23.23, metrics show [2M accounts created and 17.5M transactions](https://base-goerli.blockscout.com/stats), and over 1 million addresses holding a [Base Builder NFT](https://goerli.basescan.org/token/0xAC6564F3718837CaAdd42Eed742d75c12b90a052) for participating in [Base Quests](https://quests.base.org/). An unofficial Base ecosystem account has mapped out the Base ecosystem in [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/UniverseOnBase/status/1655594580870578176).

In addition, Base has seen impressive retention, with the highest number of unique wallet users ([~70,000](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/hess/base-retention-BUjJWB)) returning to the Base chain for subsequent transactions within one day, representing [43% of the total users](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/hess/base-retention-BUjJWB). The users, in this case, are likely mostly developers, given that these metrics are from a testnet, which gives a promising outlook for the activity that will be seen on Base mainnet.

## **Success Criteria**

A successful deployment of Uniswap on Base would result in Uniswap becoming the de facto DEX for Base upon launching. Some specific indicators of success include the following:

- **Increased TVL**: Base aims to integrate seamlessly into the Coinbase ecosystem (products + users), which creates an opportunity to introduce many net new users to Uniswap, in addition to existing users who utilize Uniswap on other chains.
- **Security and Scalability:** Base leverages the underlying security of Ethereum to enable confident on-ramps onto Base from Coinbase, Ethereum L1, and other interoperable chains.
- **Developer Empowerment and Integration:** Base has focused on [its builder community](https://base.mirror.xyz/rA5v_0BTc5AwmZdnui7ku82FzF1aTE6TJ_3vds9ymBc), which will ideally include Uniswap. Developers are also better enabled to join the Coinbase ecosystem, with seamless Coinbase product integrations, easy fiat onramps, and powerful acquisition tools. Because of these offerings, we believe Base will attract a wide range of dapp developers. Many of these dapps may utilize Uniswap or bring more users into the ecosystem, who may then use Uniswap. For this reason, we believe that adding a new chain that is focused on developers will grow the pie and be a net positive for the ecosystem and Uniswap.
- **Efficiency and Cost:** Base offers full EVM compatibility at a fraction of the cost of Ethereum mainnet and is committed to pushing forward the developer platform with features including gasless transactions for dapps, simple developer APIs for account abstraction, and secure build environments for multichain applications. This should help create a Uniswap user experience and developer opportunity that is not possible on Ethereum L1.
- **Values Alignment:** Base is open source, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. It aims to contribute toward the vision of creating a standard, modular, rollup agnostic Superchain [powered by Optimism](https://base.mirror.xyz/H_KPwV31M7OJT-THUnU7wYjOF16Sy7aWvaEr5cgHi8I). Thus driving greater accessibility, efficiency, and transparency in the ecosystem in alignment with Uniswap Foundation core initiatives.

## **Conflict of Interest Declaration**

- Anika (member of she256) works on the Base engineering team at Coinbase. She will abstain from voting on this proposal in her role at she256.
- Kendra (member of she256) is on the Uniswap Accountability Committee for Deployments. She has recused herself from any Committee actions relating to this proposal.

## **Timeline**

The proposal has passed the RFC phase without contention. This temperature check will indicate the community's desire to deploy on Base. Note that it is not a vote on the stakeholder list - this can be discussed in the forums. If the current temperature check passes, and there is no further feedback on stakeholders, then the stakeholders mentioned in the RFC will move forward with the deployment.

Of course, the deployment can only occur once Base mainnet is live, which is tentatively scheduled for summer 2023. The goal would be to deploy Uniswap v3 on Base mainnet on day-one of the launch. A final onchain vote would happen after Base mainnet is live and the contracts have been deployed, to recognize this deployment as the canonical Uniswap v3 deployment.",neutral

98,"## Summary

Proposal for the full deprecation of stable rate mode from Aave v2 and v3, with all user positions being swapped to variable.

## Motivation

On the 4th of November 2023 6, a report was received via the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty program about a critical bug related to the stable borrow rate.

Only certain assets were affected due to their configuration, but given the nature of the bug, together with the progressive deprecation of stable rate that started before (not enabled in Aave v3 Ethereum, the main instance of Aave at the moment, or any other afterwards), the fix involved a full deprecation of minting mechanisms of stable debt: halting new borrowings in that mode and also halting rebalancing and swapping from variable to stable.


Even if with the halting of minting of stable rate we are fully confident that there is no further vector, the current situation is extremely asymmetric, and creating really important technical overhead, for example when doing security evaluations/reviews of the protocol: there are user positions at stable, which factually have fixed rate until they decide to close it, without any kind of rebalancing applicable.

Additionally, and even if we know with full certainty that it is not applicable anymore, we are not comfortable disclosing how was the attack vector reported in November until all user stable debt positions are closed.

Therefore, after evaluating the scenario for some time, we think the better solution is to progress on the deprecation of stable rate, by having all user positions at stable moved to variable.

## Specification

The Pool smart contract on both Aave v2 and v3 has a function `swapBorrowRateMode()`, originally allowing for an user to swap his own borrow mode from stable to variable and vice versa, and after the bug report, only allowing the user to swap from stable to variable.

With one of the swap directions not available anymore, this function becomes factually a mechanism of off-boarding from stable rate to variable. However, in some cases, for lack of monitoring of the positions, and in others, because it is not profitable, multiple users have stayed in stable rate mode, not swapping to variable.

The proposal consists in an update to the Aave Pool and its affected libraries to make the `swapBorrowRateMode()` permission-less (technical details apart) in order to allow any address to trigger a swap of rate from variable to stable.

This will allow, for example, an Aave DAO automation to swap all current stable debt positions to variable, without any type of penalty to the users, apart from losing their stable exposure (sometimes positive for them, sometimes negative, if compared with the current variable rate).

As no new positions with stable rate can be created, this will allow for the final off-boarding of the mode, once all positions are at variable.",bullish
99,"## Simple Summary
This ARC calls for the Aave DAO to commit to selecting the Ethereum Mainnet running under the Proof of Stake consensus over any Ethereum fork running an alternative consensus (such as Proof of Work).

## Motivation
Ethereum is undergoing a long-awaited core change, switching its consensus mechanism from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. More information about this change and its impact can be found through [this succinct summary](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-technical-analysis-aave-ethereums-pos-merge/9226) by BGD Labs as well as [here](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) & [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEuPmA8w0Kc).

The Aave Protocol code will be fully functional following the Ethereum consensus change as has been demonstrated through [testing](https://twitter.com/aaveaave/status/1534188915816546305?s=21&t=i1x2M9ra9aOGN_B5MutGkA). This includes the deployment of Aave V3 on the Ropsten and Goerli testnets for public testing during their merges.

There is general consensus from builders involved in the protocol’s development that it is effectively impossible to sustain a viable Aave Market on any Ethereum fork running an alternative consensus (such as Proof of Work). To ensure continued existence of the protocol for the community, the Aave DAO should consider signaling strongly that the Aave Protocol should commit to the Ethereum Mainnet, running under Proof of Stake consensus.

The Aave protocol is one of the largest DeFi applications in the world [as measured by TVL](https://defillama.com/) and is an essential piece of infrastructure powering hundreds of other dApps and experiences in the DeFi ecosystem. The DAO should send a clear signal to the DeFi ecosystem about where it stands with respect to the Ethereum merge.

The DAO’s formal position will be determined via this governance vote.

## Specification
- Formally signal the Aave DAO Deployment on the Ethereum Mainnet running under the Proof of Stake consensus is “the canonical” governance of the Aave DAO & Markets.
- Authorize the Community Guardian to take the necessary actions to shut down Aave Deployments on any forks arising from the Ethereum Paris Hard Fork (the Merge).",bullish

title: [ARFC] GHO - Increase Borrow Rate
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & ACI - @MarcZeller
created: 2023-10-30

---

# Summary

This publication proposes increasing the GHO Borrow Rate from 3.00% to 4.72%, the proposed sDAI rate.

# Motivation

Over the past week, the GHO peg has been gradually declining, while the supply has been increasing. Users have been minting GHO and subsequently exchanging it for other assets.

Incremental interest rate hikes have not had the desired effect, evident by GHO price continuing to trade lower. The GHO borrowing rate remains significantly lower compared to other stablecoins.

This publication suggests aligning the GHO borrowing rate with the proposed sDAI rate, 4.72%. The aim is to reduce the borrowing discount of GHO relative to other stablecoins before returning to periodic 50bps increases.

The chart below shows the general GHO price downwards trend. 

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByIPGWaz6.png)

The below shows the borrow rate of GHO relative to other stable coins.

The main types of collateral backing GHO are wstETH (29.68%), wETH (28.84%), wBTC (20.44%) and rETH (8.94%). For reference, sDAI makes up 2.07% of the collateral supporting GHO debt with a current APR of [5.0%](https://daistats.com/#/ecosystem) which is expected to adjust lower to 4.72%. A large portion of the collateral backing GHO is generating yield which acts to offset borrowing costs.

By increasing the borrow rate to 4.72%, the goal is to improve the peg by reducing the incentive to mint GHO relative to other stable coins. As a result, GHO's growth is expected to slow. This publication prioritises returning GHO to peg over growth. 

After implementing this proposal, the community can continue with the current plan, [direct-to-AIP process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/349/).

### [ARFC]  Onboard wbETH on Aave V3 BNB Chain

### Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

### Date: 2024-04-02

---

### **Summary**

This ARFC proposes the addition of wbETH the Binance Liquid Staked ETH Token to Aave V3 BNB Chain to enhance LST liquidity and asset diversity.

## **Motivation**

Liquid Staked Tokens are one of the premier collateral types on Aave and drive most of the ETH borrow demand. wBETH is one of the largest Liquid Staking Tokens on the market and one of the more productive assets available on BNB Chain.

The Aave-Chan Initiative supports LST diversity in Aave V3 and looks to add more LST to the new BNB Chain deployment.

## **Specification**

wbETH: [0xa2E3356610840701BDf5611a53974510Ae27E2e1](https://bscscan.com/token/0xa2E3356610840701BDf5611a53974510Ae27E2e1)

HAL makes it simple to monitor and build automated workflows based on real-time blockchain data. Our mission is to ""glue"" together centralised and decentralised technologies (https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-gluing-manifesto-159cabef0532) to help the ecosystem strive. By leveraging push notifications, DAOs can increase user engagements and provide additional value to their members.

This proposal looks to embed the HAL notification system into the Aave UI.

### Motivation

Given the market volatility, it is critical for Aave's lenders and borrowers to carefully monitor their positions to prevent liquidation. HAL's Aave recipes (https://9000.hal.xyz/aave) are already used by thousands of users for risk management.

Adding HAL into the Aave UI will unlock additional level of protocol engagement and security for all Aave users.

### Benefits for the Aave community

The integration would allow all AAVE users to be notified about the status of their Health Factor. Using our recipe, AAVE users can be notified in real time on the health factor conditions of their position, thus greatly reducing the risk of being liquidated.

Moreover, this integration increases the trust within the AAVE community, allowing anyone to have access to information on the health factor in a straightforward form and with the possibility of receiving a notification via Email, Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Slack and Webhook. We already witnessed a similar positive feedback loop in the past when we did a similar integration with Bancor (https://twitter.com/HAL_Team/status/1389945442818011140).

title: [ARFC - Temp check] “MVP” V3 deployment on ZkEVM mainnet

Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative 

Dated: 2023-03-02

- --

# **Summary**

ZkEVM is an EVM-equivalent zk-rollup L2 developed by the Polygon team that is expected to be deployed on March 27th.

Aave V3 has been successfully deployed on the ZkEVM testnet for approximately 6 months (since October 2022). This testnet deployment was done for testing purposes by the @AaveCompanies team.

Since ZkEVM is EVM-equivalent, deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work.

The Aave-Chan Initiative supports L2 diversity as part of its governance platform.

This minimal Aave V3 deployment, with strictly limited assets onboarding (”MVP V3”), can be an opportunity to establish a strategic Aave presence early in this new network while staying conservative in terms of risk.

This ARFC proposal should be considered as a ""temperature check"" that would allow development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the zkEVM network.

# **Abstract**

This ARFC presents the Aave governance with an opportunity to “temp check” the deployment of a MVP version of Aave V3 on the ZkEVM L2.

# **Motivation**

The proposal to deploy Aave V3.0.1 on the ZkEVM L2 network, also known as ""MVP V3,"" presents an opportunity for Aave Governance to establish a strategic presence on this new network early on. Aave has a history of pioneering in new frontiers, starting with the Polygon & Avalanche V2 deployment in 2021.

ZkEVM is an L2 solution developed by the Polygon team that is EVM-equivalent. Deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work. However, to reduce risk, the proposal suggests limiting asset onboarding and setting conservative risk parameters. This will enable development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the ZkEVM network. The proposal recommends onboarding only three collaterals (WETH, WMATIC & USDC) and one borrowable asset (USDC) to reduce risk exposure.

It is important to note that the presented risk parameters should be considered as suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.

This proposal also lays the groundwork for an ""MVP"" L2 GHO facilitator if governance considers this option in the future.

Overall, this proposal has the potential to expand Aave's reach in the DeFi space by allowing it to expand to new ""frontier"" networks.

# **Specification**

This ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy an “MVP V3” of Aave V3.0.1 with only three collaterals: WETH, WMATIC & USDC, and only one borrowable asset: USDC.

108,"Summary:

Harmony is proposing to work with the Curve to deploy Curve on the Harmony blockchain. This will expand stablecoin swap to its community of users and provide incentives to bootstrap the launch of Curve to a new ecosystem.

Abstract:

Our proposal is to support Curve as it continues to expand in the coming multi-chain world. Harmony is an open and fast blockchain that is fully Ethereum compatible with 2-second transaction finality and near-zero fees.

Harmony invites the Curve community to support this launch. Harmony will provide $2 million in incentives in ONE tokens to bootstrap initial usage of Curve on Harmony. We also propose the Curve community to contribute CRV tokens to add incentives to the launch.

In addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support.

Harmony is a sharded proof-of-stake blockchain. It has processed more than 93 million transactions on mainnet 4 and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible. Our secure bridges offer cross-chain asset transfers with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.

Motivation:

Curve is ready to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Harmony ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Sushi on Harmony and other DeFi projects.

A unique feature of Harmony is our bridges to Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain which are bringing in stablecoins and pegged assets from both ecosystems, i.e. ethBUSD-bscBUSD. This creates an unique opportunity for Curve to support stablecoin swapping of assets from multiple chains.

Specification:

The Harmony and Curve will deploy the Curve contracts and gauge on Harmony. Harmony supports EVM and Ethereum tooling, leading to a seamless integration, much like other EVM chains and L2s. During Harmony’s DeFi Hackathon in Sep 2020, a community team already successfully ported Curve on testnet: GitHub - harmony-one/dapp-curve-contracts 3 and GitHub - harmony-one/dapp-curve-ui: Frontend for curve.fi on harmony.one 6).

After the market is functional, we will work with the Curve for cross-chain governance implementation on Curve on Harmony.

Metrics
over 18,010 delegators and 118 validators, staking 4.2 billion ONEs ($700m staked)
$84 million TVL on Sushi on Harmony, and $30 million combined on other DEXes
$91 million TVL on Harmony’s bridge to Ethereum and BSC
3,200 creators and $1.6 million sales on DaVinci NFT marketplace
100+ active apps; over 135,300 active wallets; over 120 million mainnet transactions

Incentives

Harmony will provide $2M USD in ONE tokens in incentives in the form of native ONE tokens for 1 year to bootstrap initial usage with the following emission schedule:

Months 1-3: 40%
Months 4-6: 30%
Months 7-9: 20%
Months 10-12: 10%

For:

Curve will be the first major stablecoin swap on Harmony and will add net new users from Harmony’s 350,000+ community members. After enabling DeFi primitives like AMMs, our community is eagerly awaiting a stablecoin swap on Harmony.

Against:

Curve will need to maintain an additional deployment on Harmony. Harmony will work with Curve to ensure a smooth deployment and work together to enable multi-chain governance in the future roadmap.",neutral

Many other top protocols already have this functionality. PancakeSwap cannot stay behind in this.

For example, an user wants to add liquidity to USDC-BUSD pool, but only holds BUSD. This user needs to swap an x% amount of BUSD to USDC MANUALLY and then proceed to adding the desired amount.

110,"**Summary**:

Enable a 1bp, 1tick fee tier on optimism (L2).

The rationale and initial temperature check for this proposal can be found here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-a-1bp-fee-tier-to-uniswapv3-on-optimism/16930

**Process**:

The complete process is described in Uniswap’s Governance Reference here 4 and can be summarized as:

• A proposal is posted in GovernorBravo on Mainnet (GovernorAlpha for Kovan)

• The proposal is voted, queued and executed via Timelock.

• When all the conditions are meet and is executed, Timelock contract, which is authorized to execute administrative actions on the protected contracts, will execute 
the requested actions in the proposal.

Since this proposal needs to be executed on a different network, in this case L2 Optimism, the executing action needs to be forwarded to the proper target. In order to do that, Timelock will send the transaction to OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger (Optimism mechanism to forward transactions from L1 to L2).

The transaction will then be sent via Optimism contracts to Uniswap’s CrossChainAccount, that is the privileged contract that can execute administrative tasks on protected contracts on L2 Optimism, and CrossChainAccount will forward the transaction, if it has the right origin, to the target Contract, in this case to UniswapV3Factory.
The sequence of contract interactions is the following:

• GovernorBravo.propose(targets, values, signatures, calldatas, description)
    ◦ where targets are the address of the contracts to interact with,
    ◦ calldatas the calldatas to execute on those contracts, and
    ◦ description, the description of the proposal (or name)

• OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(target, calldata, gas)
    ◦ where target is the address of the contracts to interact with on L2,
    ◦ calldata the calldata to execute on that contract, and
    ◦ gas, the gas to be used on that transaction

• CrossChainAccount.forward(target, calldata)
    ◦ where target is the address of the Uniswap contracts to interact with on L2, and
    ◦ calldata the calldata to execute on that contract

• UniswapV3Factory.enableFeeAmount(fee,tickSpacing)
    ◦ where fee is the fee to enable (in hundredths of a bip), and
    ◦ tickSpacing the spacing between ticks

Compiling all the calls together it can be seen as:

GovernorBravo.propose(
[OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger address],
[ 0 ],
[ “” ],
[ encodedCalldata(
OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(
CrossChainAccount address,
encodedCalldata(CrossChainAccount.forward(
UniswapV3Factory address,
encodedCalldata(
UniswapV3Factory.enableFeeAmount(
100,
1
)
)
)
),
8000000
) ],
“Enable 1bp fee tier on Optimism”
)

Title: [ARFC] TokenLogic & karpatkey Service Provider Partnership
Discussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633
Author: @TokenLogic @karpatkey
Created: 2023-12-05

---

# Summary

This ARFC is to onboard TokenLogic & karpatkey to provide financial services to the Aave DAO for an initial period of 180 days, with a combined budget of 400k GHO.

# Motivation

## Overview

TokenLogic & karpatkey are responsible for delivering the following services to the Aave DAO: 

* Treasury Management;
* Strategic Assets' Liquidity; and
* Safety Module.

This funding will be used to support the TokenLogic and karpatkey teams to deliver the scope as outlined in the [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633).

## What to Expect

This proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO’s treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.

### Treasury Management

#### Develop the Architecture for Managing Aave's Assets

We aim to define a robust architecture for asset management. This architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s “shortExecutor”. Over time this will lead to fund management delegation and reduced governance overhead.

As the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.

#### Financial Security

A key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO’s known budget and anticipated expenses. 

This approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO. Key components of this objective will include:

* Bridging Aave funds between networks;
* Migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and
* Swap assets to align expenses and holdings.

Do note, that financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost-conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.

### Strategic Assets' Liquidity

TokenLogic and karpatkey will lead the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) and oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:

* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO’s price movement towards re-pegging while maintaining its utility across a full range of AMMs.
    * Utilize Maverick’s design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.
    * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.
    * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.
    * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility in their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave’s AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.
* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token’s value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:
    * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.
    * Enhance GHO’s extrinsic demand by incentivizing stable swap pools, such as Balancer’s GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.
     * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer’s architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO’s price stability.
     * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.
    * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.
* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it into tangible rewards through participation in voting markets such as Curve, Convex, Balancer, and Aura.

For operational simplicity and alignment with the DAO’s strategic objectives, evolving the GHO Liquidity Committee into the Aave Liquidity Committee is a logical step. 

### Safety Module

As part of the scope, karpatkey and TokenLogic will focus on modelling the SM performance during shortfall events and present proposals to diversify asset categories. This proposal will feature how the DAO can utilize the vlAURA position, realize synergies between GHO Liquidity and overall attempt to reduce the DAOs insurance fund spend.

The below outlines at a high level what we intend to deliver:

* Introduce additional asset categories to promote diversification and reduce the dependence on AAVE as a backstop for the protocol. 
    * Initial parameter configuration will incorporate feedback from @ChaosLabs & @Gauntlet. 
    * We will explore the feasibility of including GHO LP assets and harness rewards from other protocols.
    * Technical lift associated with creating new categories will be performed by @bgdlabs, with a security audit, if required.
* A 90-day emission forecast will be provided ahead of each emission cycle for community feedback. TokenLogic and karpatkey will prepare the payload to extend the SM emissions for @bgdlabs for review. 
    * Iterative emission cycles enable the DAO to target specific asset categories and improve the correlations between bad debt potential whilst maintaining a base level of insurance. The proposal will feature the ability to reward some categories with non AAVE rewards, like GHO, to support adoption and velocity.
* Capital efficiency, optimize emission schedules to balance attracting and retaining new deposits for each respective category. For example, the APR on stkAAVE is expected to continue being reduced given the recent GHO Mint Discount utility being added and the introduction of new categories.
* Analytics, a dashboard will be created/maintained that tracks the effective coverage of the insurance fund under various market conditions. The deposit value, composition of assets, APR over time and impact on the DAOs runway will all be readily available for the community to view. This is expected to create transparency and provide insight into the performance of the SM as an effective insurance fund for the DAO.

# Specification

The AIP will call the createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController interface to create two 180-day streams for 220k and 180k of GHO.

The following address will be the recipient of the 220k GHO stream:
Address: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`

The following address will be the recipient of the 180k GHO stream:
Address: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`

TokenLogic and karpatkey will periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.

TokenLogic and karpatkey are to be included in the Gas Rebate program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts, deployment and testing costs.

Upon the ARFC Snapshot passing, the GLC SAFE Signers will be updated. The following signer `0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f` is to be replaced with `0x818c277dbe886b934e60aa047250a73529e26a99`.

When the AIP onboarding TokenLogic and karpatkey as service providers pass, TokenLogic and karpatkey will jointly lead the GLC for the duration of the service provider contract with the Aave DAO.

117,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.


## Specification

This past week did not see outsized changes in market conditions nor within the Aave protocol. There were slight volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets. Our platform recommends the following set of parameter changes that will decrease liquidation bonuses on several less-utilized assets.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAL Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |
| DPI Loan To Value     | 65%     | 70%     |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| DPI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |
| ENJ Loan To Value    | 60%     | 70%     |
| MANA Loan To Value    | 65%     | 70%     |
| MKR Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| UNI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Further Aave v1 deprecation strategy

Author: BGD Labs @bgdlabs

Date: 2024-01-09

---

## Summary
Approve further steps of Aave v1 off-boarding, to reduce operational overhead on deprecated Aave instances.


## Motivation
The Aave protocol v1 was released in January 2020 and eventually superseded by Aave protocol v2 in December on the same year.

While Aave v1 has been deprecated for a long time, some liquidity is still stuck on the protocol 1. Even if this instance is not covered by the Aave Safety Module, being part of Aave, it still is monitored and evaluated whenever development and/or security decisions are made.

This creates meaningful overhead for all involved development & security teams, which directly adds cost to the Aave DAO. Additionally, the architecture of Aave v1 is quite different to Aave v2 & v3, making it the most ad-hoc instance of Aave.

For the previous reasons, we think the community should evaluate approving extra off-boarding steps.


## Specification
To achieve a complete off-boarding of Aave v1, the following needs to be completed:

- All debt has to be settled, in order to allow liquidity providers on v1 to withdraw.
- All assets have to be withdrawn.

To minimise the impact on users we propose a phased approach, where each phase could last in the order of 1-3 weeks.

### Phase 1
In a first phase we recommend to upgrade the liquidation mechanism on the protocol in the following ways:

- It should no longer be possible to receive aTokens for liquidations (as the goal is to remove liquidity, not transfer it from user to user).
- It should be possible to liquidate healthy (collateralised) positions with a fixed liquidationBonus (e.g. 1%). This value should be small to not hurt borrowers, while still being big enough to incentivise liquidations. If this Temp Check is successful, we will confirm the number with risk providers., but 1% at the current moment would make the liquidation profitable for approximately 85% of the positions to liquidate.
- It should be possible to liquidate a entire position at once (currently on Aave v1 only 50% of a position can be liquidated).
- Interest rates should be lowered to the minimum, as the previously described always-enabled dynamics remove any need of utilisation dynamics.
- Remove flash loan fee, as there should not be extra incentives for liquidity providers.

### Phase 2
In a second phase we recommend increasing the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage.

The exact number must be chosen based on current market conditions to minimise user impact, but allow economical liquidations.

### Phase 3
Once the big majority of debt is repaid, we recommend to introduce a forced withdrawal mechanism. With forced withdrawals anybody could withdraw on behalf of any liquidity provider on Aave v1, with the funds received by the holder of the aToken.

It is important to clarify that further technical aspects on this should be analysed before executing this step, for example smart contracts receiving funds without triggering a withdrawal.

---

After all the Phases are finished, additional ad-hoc steps can be executed, like Rescue Mission for locked funds.


## Next Steps

If this TEMP CHECK is approved, we will proceed with an ARFC, with the final steps including feedback from risk service providers, and precise technical decisions.

Finally, AIPs will be created for the different phases.

119,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. 



## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV.** The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. 


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **CRV Liquidation Threshold**    | 64%     | ***61%***     |
| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 8.5%     | 8.0%     |
| DAI Liquidation Threshold     | 85%     | 90%     |
| WBTC Liquidation Threshold     | 75%     | 80%     |
| WBTC Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 5.0%     |



## Notable Accounts to Flag

As of 8/18/2022, the data shows that no accounts would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on this forum post.

The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

120,"Title: [ARC] Ethereum v2 Reserve Factor - aFEI Holding Update 
Author: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham 
Created: 21-08-2022

## Simple Summary

In response to Tribe DAO’s proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes redeeming all aFEI for FEI and exchanging it for DAI. 

## Abstract

The Aave DAO currently holds around 619,185.82 units of aFEI in the Ethereum Reserve Factor. Due to the uncertainty around the future of Tribe DAO and FEI, this proposal presents the community the opportunity to reduce exposure to the FEI stablecoin.  

If other lenders move to redeem aFEI for FEI before Aave DAO acts, then there is a risk that Aave DAO becomes trapped as a lender of last resort. Due to this risk, this proposal strongly encourages the DAO to redeem aFEI for FEI as an immediate priority.

After redeeming the aFEI for FEI, risk can be further reduced by redeeming or swapping the FEI holding for a stablecoin with a more certain future. In this proposal, we suggest redeeming the FEI for DAI via the Tribe DAO Peg Stability Module which will incur a 0.03% fee.

## Motivation

The FEI lending market is a concentrated market with three main providers of liquidity. Tribe DAO, Aave DAO and Badger DAO make up the top three liquidity providers by providing 88.76%, 5.47% and 2.72% respectively. Fei Labs has proposed redeeming all aFEI for FEI which will remove [10,067,143.35](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaFBd7Bd91B4c1Dd289EE47a4F030FBeDfa7ABc12) units of FEI from the lending market. However, there are only ​​[9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units of FEI held within the lending market.

Fei Labs is unable to withdraw all of its FEI as there is insufficient liquidity, redeem amount [10,067,143.35](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaFBd7Bd91B4c1Dd289EE47a4F030FBeDfa7ABc12) > available liquidity​​ [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3). This is a problem for Fei Labs and also other lenders.

The market currently supports [11,308,536.17](https://etherscan.io/token/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units of aFEI, with 2,275,205.37 units of debt and [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units available for lenders to redeem their collateral from or for Users to borrow. Any User seeking to claim [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) or less is able to do so now, but this may change very quickly when Fei Labs or others starts redeeming aFEI causing liquidity to diminish.

Aave DAO has 619,185.82 units of aFEI at risk of being caught in an illiquid position. If the FEI held within the lending market falls below 619,185.82 units before Aave DAO redeems its position, it will become a trapped lender until such time as borrowers repay their loans. It is likely that as this market is unwound by large liquidity providers redeem aFEI, that the utilisation and interest rate will increase, which hopefully triggering borrowers to repay loans.

This proposal has been put in motion to try to prevent Aave DAO becoming a trapped lender in the FEI market by redeeming its aFEI before liquidity dries up. We encourage all Users of the market to take responsible action in light of recent events.

Once the aFEI has been redeemed for FEI, it is to be redeemed for DAI. Tribe DAO offers a DAI PSM with a 0.03% fee that facilitates redeeming FEI for DAI. This is a simple solution and one [supported by the Tribe DAO community](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475) as part of the transition to a terminal state. The DAI PSM module has around $14.5M of liquidity at the time of writing and can be tracked [here](https://dune.com/queries/1187683). In the event that redeeming FEI for DAI runs into any issues, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve. There is a bonding curve at peer review stage for swapping USDC for BAL which can be amended to facilitate offloading FEI into the spot market. We will provide updates in the comments as the situation unfolds.

## Specification

The below provides a broad, high level summary of how the aFEI position held within the Reserve Factor will be managed.

* All of the aFEI held with the Ethereum Economic Reserve is to be redeemed for FEI.
* All FEI will be redeemed for DAI via the Tribe DAO DAI PSM
  * If any issue arises, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve
* DAI will be held in the Ethereum Reserve Factor

## Next Steps

The next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the **earliest 25th August 2022**, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to proceed as outlined above at the earliest possible date **29th August 2022**.

If we can move quicker than the proposed dates above, please do let reach out.

A proposal to make parameter changes on all V3 deployments and v2 Ethereum. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096/2?u=gauntlet).


## Motivation
Raising Uopt for USDT, DAI, FRAX to 90% can increase borrow revenue without adding excess risk. The market would need to move considerably abnormally for liquidation capacity to come into question for stablecoin collateralized liquidations for 90% Uopt.

Raising RF from 20% to 25% for USDC, USDT, LUSD on v2 Ethereum would help bring RF parity for USDC, USDT, and LUSD to DAI, and help encourage supply migration from v2 to v3 (given [AIP-306](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=306) raised DAI RF on V2 Ethereum to 25%.)




## Specification

1. Raise Uopt to 90% for USDC, USDT, DAI, FRAX, where applicable, across all v3 deployments
2. Raise RF from 20% to 25% for USDC, USDT, LUSD on v2 Ethereum


**Disclaimer: Gauntlet reserves the right to not move forward with any parameter changes recommended in Snapshot polls, if market conditions change meaningfully. We will publish AIP for this change after the unfreeze/unpause of v2 and v3 markets from the [security incident on Nov 4](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v2-v3-security-incident-04-11-2023/15335).**

### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard slisBNB to Aave V3 BNB chain 
### Author: Lorena (ListaDAO)
###  Date: 2024-06-27

---

### **Simple Summary:**
This Temp Check proposes the addition of slisBNB from ListaDAO to Aave V3 BNB chain to enhance LST liquidity and asset diversity.

**Motivation**
1. Benefits of listing: 
slisBNB is the native yield bearing and liquid staking token for BNB, built by Lista DAO. slisBNB appreciates against BNB in line with BNB’s staking APR, allowing users have the freedom to earn additional yields on different DeFi platforms while earning staking rewards passively.

slisBNB is the largest BNB LST in terms of TVL (~$225M) and holders (350,262), listing slisBNB can bring both Aave and Lista communities the opportunities to enjoy the passive yield of supplying slisBNB on Aave as well as the Lista token airdrop. 

2. Chain to be deployed: BNB Chain
3. Proof of Liquidity: Lista DAO is open to provide $2500 weekly incentives, last for 8 weeks to bootstrap the liquidity of slisBNB on Aave. 
4. Useful links: https://lista.org/


**Disclaimer**
This proposal is powered by core contributor of ListaDAO.

The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Lista DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.

**Next Steps**
1.If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2.If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage
3.Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage
4.If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal

125,"[ARC] - UI/UX upgrade governance framework
The Aave protocol is a decentralized ecosystem of smart-contracts running on several EVM networks. This ecosystem is permisionless and anyone with the required tech knowledge can freely use 100% of the Aave protocol features.

That being said, for a more accessible user experience, the Aave companies created the Aave application 4 allowing the interaction with the Aave protocol without technical knowledge.

To reinforce the decentralization of the application, the Aave app is deployed on IFPS and considering Flux hosting to avoid centralization of hosting,

also, the Aave app, is fully open source 1 and allows any developer to contribute to the improvement of the application for the benefit of the end-users.

As recently, we have witnessed multiple demands from third-parties to be integrated in the aave App (wallets, on-ramps etc…) The presented framework intends to provide governance guidelines to standardize the process of integration into the Aave App.

Title [ARC] - integrate [Entity] into the aave app
[Proposal]
Brief presentation of the entity and ecosystem 250 words max

[Proposed integration]
Brief presentation of the requested integration

examples:

a wallet requesting a direct support on user onboarding
an onramp requesting the integration of an onramp widget
a notification system requesting to be integrated into user’s dashboard
a portfolio tracker requesting link in users dashboard
In this section, the entity should detail which specific section of the app should be modified to integrate the entity.

[Current and proposed integration of Aave in the Entity ecosystem]
Is the Aave app highlighted in the entity application?
How does the integration benefit the Entity Aave’s current and potential future users?
[Technical integration]
Link to Aave interface PR requesting the integration
This framework is intended to provide standardization of UI/UX integration of the Aave App.

The proposed governance process for a UI integration is to have each entity do a governance thread open for at least 5 days.

Then open a snapshot vote with a starting voting period of 24h in the future with at least 3 days open vote period considered valid with a 100k AAVE YAE vote quorum.

the proposed options for the snapshot must be YAE/NAY/ABSTAIN.

The Aave interface GitHub maintainers will then review the integration PR and provided they don’t detect security issues, will merge the PR.

In the case of a security issue detected with the PR and not discussed before the snapshot vote, the GitHub maintainers will open technical communication channels with the entity in an effort to allow the integration to be merged but will keep a veto right regardless of the governance process in the case the integration is considered harmful to Aave users security.",bullish
126,"## Context

After passing the [Temperature Check vote](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xb328c7583c0f1ea85f8a273dd36977c95e47c3713744caf7143e68b65efcc8a5) with 7M UNI voting in favor of deploying Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain (GC), we are creating this post to move forward into the Consensus Check stage.

Comments on [the previous post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-v3-be-deployed-to-gnosis-chain/16513) expressed support for v3 deployment on GC, but also suggested more clarity on the following topics:

* The team that will be deploying Uniswap v3 on GC
* The bridge used to facilitate cross-chain governance for Uniswap v3 on GC
* The details of liquidity incentives provided, including timelines and logistics for transferring funds

We have updated this post accordingly and provided more details on each of these items.

## About Gnosis Chain

In production since 2018 (as the xDai Chain), the rebranded [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com/) is rapidly evolving with a new focus and mission. Gnosis Chain (GC) provides a real-world value chain that closely mirrors the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. This includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other vital functionality. GC will serve in a front-running capacity for important Ethereum 2.0 updates.

Tuned parameters on Gnosis Chain enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost stable transactions, and the opportunity to construct trustless bridges and conduct seamless transfers between GC and the Ethereum 2.0 mainnet.

## Proposal

The Gnosis Chain team is committed to ecosystem development, adoption, and growth as the Eth2.0 landscape comes into focus. With a mission to “accelerate Ethereum,” Gnosis Chain is poised for expansion. With this in mind, we propose a Uniswap v3 deployment to Gnosis Chain. We believe there are many benefits for both Uniswap Labs and Uniswap users, some of which include:

1. A DeFi ecosystem primed for growth. Once deployed, Uniswap would become a cornerstone DeFi engine for protocols using and interacting within the ecosystem. Perpetual Protocol is a flagship protocol on GC that relies on Uniswap v3. This deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on the Gnosis Chain. Additional bluechip app deployments with growing TVL include Curve, Sushiswap, and Tornado Cash, with many new and promising DeFi projects choosing Gnosis Chain as their home base. A list of current projects is available at [https://gnosischain.world/
](https://gnosischain.world/)
2. An iterative environment. Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionality and alpha test new features in a real-value environment (which differs from a test environment in that users behave differently with value on the line, token supply is limited, real adversaries exist, etc). Uniswap can spot and remediate any final potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates prior to mainnet activation and take advantage of optimized slot and epoch times for faster iteration.

3. Tight Ethereum compatibility. Tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Gnosis Chain, with more onboarding regularly. Gnosis Safe is facilitating daily operations for many existing projects. [A trustless bridge architecture designed to connect Ethereum and Gnosis Chain is in the works](https://hackmd.io/g8TK7IzYQjClTTaor-ypIQ). The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) is expanding rapidly bringing massive decentralization to the chain.
The primary differences separating the GBC from the Ethereum Beacon chain include 5-second blocks and < 2-minute epochs, stable transactions with a max target of $.01 per 100K gas, and an economically and geographically diverse validator set, and a lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.

4. Unique chain characteristics. Stable, low-cost transactions provide unique opportunities for Uniswap users. When gas costs are known and have a low impact on trade decisions, new strategies and approaches emerge which are currently untenable on the Ethereum mainnet or other chains with wide-ranging fee variability.

5. User incentives. A large directive for the Gnosis Chain is to increase the user base and on-chain activity by strategically allocating funds from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. An ecosystem fund has been created for this purpose, and we propose to use a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. We propose providing up to $10M to incentivize the adoption of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain.

## Details for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3

The $10M will be provided in GNO to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. The incentives should be designed together with other projects, which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as Perpetual Protocol, Gelato, or Stakewise. This should allow for more sustainable utilization of Uniswap as Gnosis Chain doesn’t have a team dedicated to Uniswap v3. The GNO can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing usage of Uniswap v3, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3 should be supported. The goal is to spend the $10M in the time period of 2 years. Funds not used after two years would go back to GnosisDAO. The spending is limited to $10M and the transferred amount of GNO as part of the proposal. GnosisDAO can decide to top up this amount based on the outcome of this initiative.

## Cross-Chain Governance with Nomad

Since the Temperature Check, we have discussed with stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem, who have expressed a desire to see trust-minimized bridges used for governance for new Uniswap v3 deployments. In addition, we’ve also seen the [Nomad](http://nomad.xyz) team’s proposal to [deploy v3 on Moonbeam](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-deploy-uniswap-v3-to-moonbeam/16624), which includes a section addressing this, as well as documenting the current fragmented approach to governance across various v3 deployments.

In the interest of taking a standardized approach to cross-chain governance of v3 deployments moving forward, we’ve partnered with the Nomad team to leverage the Nomad generalized message passing channels to manage the governance of the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.

We believe that Nomad is the best solution for cross-chain governance, as it:

* [Supports generalized messages](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) between chains
* Does not rely on a multi-sig or validator set, but rather leverages an optimistic mechanism that allows bad messages to be challenged via fraud proofs

Nomad will be deployed on Gnosis Chain shortly and will leverage [Gnosis Zodiac Modules](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) as part of its governance stack.

We are excited about partnering with Nomad to create a trust-minimized governance stack that can offer a standard for the Uniswap ecosystem.

## License Exemption

We are requesting an exemption that will allow Gnosis Ltd. to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Gnosis Chain, a layer 1 blockchain with deep connections to Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.

## Timeline

Following the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.

## Proposal Acceptance and Execution

As the proposal funding has to come from GnosisDAO, this proposal has to be accepted by both: UNI and GNO token holders. The execution of this proposal is dependent also on the acceptance of the proposal by GnosisDAO. The GnosisDAO proposal has to include the setup of the multi-sig and the allocation of GNO and would be executed once it is accepted by GNO token holders. Two singers from the Uniswap community and two singers from the GnosisDAO community should be selected to participate in the multisig wallet.

## Conclusion

The Gnosis Chain is preparing for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive infrastructure grants program including large grants to Nethermind, Lighthouse and Erigon client teams to support base-layer functionality and security. The [ecosystem fund](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-16-gnosis-chain-xdai-gnosis-merge/1904) will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.

We welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you.",neutral

Title: [ARFC-Addendum] Update Merit for Round 4
Date: 2024-05-09
Author: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)
---

### Simple Summary

We propose updating Merit parameters and rewarded actions to increase program efficiency, as well as evolving the wETH part of the merit program with a new program called “Ahab”.

###  Motivation

Merit’s first quarter and three initial rounds have been a clear success. Morpho Optimizers are now a dead product with zombie remaining TVL, and GHO grew to $54M despite unfavorable market conditions. The Aave protocol maintained and developed its market share in DeFi in a highly competitive landscape thanks to the Merit program. While “Merit is Forever” has been approved by governance, we aim to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program.

### Specification

#### Boosters Update

Removal of “Second-degree user of aligned protocol”: due to lack of demand from second-degree protocols and investment in positioning Aave at the front row, this booster is no longer justified. We will reconsider reintroduction if some protocols show signs of Aave-alignment.
Introducing weETH in the “Diversity supporter” boost: weETH is the fastest-growing reserve in Aave V3 Ethereum, and this boost was designed to favor alternatives to main LST. It might be worth introducing a LRT to this boost.
Removal of OG DAO participant: this boost was designed to reward early participants in the Aave DAO, but it seems unfair for new users to keep having this boost after more than a quarter. We propose doubling the “Active in governance” boost to favor users supporting the DAO voting activity.

#### Diluters Update

StkGHO Cooldown users: we consider users declaring their intent to leave the safety module should not receive Merit rewards. A full dilution is seen as punitive and not in line with Aave’s ethos, so we propose stopping the points meter when these users call the cooldown method, allowing them to accumulate points until the cooldown activation.
Morpho Users: The Morpho protocol continues to show direct hostility towards the Aave ecosystem onchain & offchain. We propose including all present and future Morpho products.

#### Merit wETH Program

The merit wETH program has both been a total success and below expectations. This program has factually been the opportunity for >250k ETH to leave other protocols to join Aave, but these results are almost exclusively due to direct coordinated BD actions from Aave Finance & ACI with a small subset of “whale” users.

We consider it an inefficient allocation of resources to continue the program as it is. To upgrade this program, we propose focusing on the most efficient aspect and focusing on the BD “whale hunter” efforts. We propose rebranding this new part of the program as the “Ahab” program, which is expected to be significantly more budget-efficient than the current program.

### Next Steps

1. Gather community consensus on this proposed path.
2. If there is agreement, escalate this ARFC-Addendum proposal to a snapshot vote for formal approval.

### Disclamer

The Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes “Merit” without external compensation.

128,"## Summary

A proposal to make parameter changes on Ethereum v3 and Polygon v3. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-recommendation-to-re-enable-crv-borrowing-on-v3-ethereum-polygon/15513 ).


## Motivation

During the Vyper exploit, [CRV borrowing was disabled](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-disable-borrows-for-crv-on-v3-ethereum-and-polygon/14377) on Ethereum and Polygon v3 with the hope of mitigating downward CRV price movement in light of excess CRV positions on Aave v2.

Given that a large majority of those CRV positions with excess risk have left the system, Gauntlet recommends reactivating CRV borrowing. In order to do so, we recommend a few other changes to CRV parameterization.


## Specification

Ethereum v3

- Lower supply cap from 51m → 7.5m, due to [low usage](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave/markets/ethereum/assets/crv?fullscreen=asset_timeseries_supply_cap_usage).
- Lower borrow cap from 7.7m → 5m due to [low usage](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave/markets/ethereum/assets/crv?fullscreen=asset_timeseries_borrow_cap_usage).
- Lower debt ceiling from $5m → $1m due to low usage (current debt ceiling usage is $17k / $5m).
- Reactivate CRV borrowing.

Polygon v3
- Lower borrow cap from 900k → 300k due to [low usage](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave/markets/polygon/assets/crv?fullscreen=asset_timeseries_borrow_cap_usage).
- Reactivate CRV borrowing.

title: [ARFC] Add native USDC to the Arbitrum V3 pool
author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative
created: 2023-06-06
---

## Abstract

This ARFC proposes to add the native version of USDC on Arbitrum to the Aave V3 pool on Arbitrum. The native USDC token will eventually become the ""canon"" version of the USDC stablecoin on the Arbitrum L2. The current USDC onboarded on Aave V3 Arbitrum pool should now be considered ""USDC.e"" as it's a bridged asset with an underlying USDC on Ethereum.

## Motivation

Circle is set to launch a native version of USDC on Arbitrum, which is anticipated to become the primary version of the USDC stablecoin on the Arbitrum L2. This will supersede the current ""USDC.e"" token, which is a bridged asset with an underlying USDC on Ethereum.

From our experience with the Avalanche Pool, we've learned that a prudent approach to integrating such a native token involves initially onboarding it with parameters similar to its bridged counterpart, but with more conservative caps. As the native USDC builds secondary liquidity and matures, we can gradually decrease the attractiveness of USDC.e and increase the caps for the native USDC.

This ARFC is focused solely on the onboarding of the native USDC and does not propose any action for USDC.e. As a result, if this proposal is accepted by the governance, both USDC.e and the native USDC will be onboarded simultaneously on the Arbitrum V3 pool. This strategy aims to ensure a smooth transition and maintain the stability of the Aave V3 pool on Arbitrum.



## Specification

### Token Information

- Token Symbol: USDC
- Token Address: [0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831)

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave Events & Sponsorship Grant 2024
Author: Aave Labs
Date: 2024-07-08
---
## Summary
Aave Labs is pleased to announce an event grant proposal. This proposal includes participation in key ecosystem initiatives at EthCC and Devcon among other events.

## Goals
To reinforce Aave Protocol’s unique and positive culture, share technical knowledge, and attract new community members. These initiatives are aimed at helping to continue the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem by showcasing Aave Protocol’s core values.

## Background
Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, contributors, and stakeholders.

Although the Aave Protocol has emerged as a leader within DeFi, the sector at large is still in its nascent stages, and Aave should work hard to retain its spot as a leader. For the events proposal from the DAO for 2024, Aave Labs wants to concentrate on proposing fewer but higher-quality events to maximize impact. 

## Overview
Aave Labs is requesting a grant for 650,000 GHO for events for the remainder of 2024 for EthCC Brussels (45%) and Devcon Bangkok (55%):
1. **Hackathons & Bounties:** We want to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, and to remain visible and competitive in a growing industry, but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem. We propose to sponsor one ETHGlobal hackathon in Q4 in Bangkok.
2. **Open Finance Day:** We are hosting Open Finance Day in partnership with key players in DeFi for high quality talks, networking, and light bites. Talks will include members of the DeFi community, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members and service providers. 
3. **Side Events:** Hosting side events alongside major conferences is an opportunity to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge, and industry insights. Typically featuring panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts, side events are designed to strengthen awareness of Aave and GHO technology among strategic audiences, reach new target audiences, and ensure Aave and GHO remain top-of-mind within and outside the community. 
4. **Merch:** Aave Labs seeks to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement and awareness-building efforts as well as to proliferate the new visual identity and the beloved Ronnie ghost. Aave Labs will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials and creation of merchandise people actually wear, use, and love.
5. **rAAVE:** To celebrate the Aave community’s welcoming culture, we aim to host two more editions of the flagship rAAVE event. Throughout the past years rAAVE has positioned itself to be the most sought after event in the ecosystem. They foster community spirit and create memorable experiences. We will integrate the GHO Pass for ticketing logistics and manage press relations and social media to maximize awareness and inclusion. This year’s events will be hosted at EthCC in Brussels and Devcon in Bangkok. To mitigate some costs for rAAVE, we are planning to potentially obtain co-sponsorship with current or potentially new partners for the Aave ecosystem. Due to the event’s high visibility, it is crucial that if co-sponsorship is obtained, the selected partners are aligned with the Aave Community and this is conducted in a balanced manner.

After covering the aforementioned main sponsorships, any remaining budget will be directed towards side events related to the security of DeFi and smart contract technology. Any excess funds from this grant will be rolled over to be used for events during Q1 2025. A recap on last year’s events was posted to governance last December, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-events-sponsorship-budget/14953/18).

Aave Labs shall cover all expenses for its team members, and this proposal does not request any funds for these expenses, or include any compensation for Aave Labs’ work.

## Next Steps
If Snapshot is successful, then move to AIP

 ## Conclusion
We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of 650,000 GHO for activations and events for the remainder of 2024 will not only help enrich the Aave Protocol ecosystem, but will foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition.

We look forward to the DAO’s support for this proposal for these events during 2024.",bullish
133,"# **Summary**

This ARFC proposes the Aave DAO budget allocation on events at key ecosystem initiatives at EthCC and Devcon to help to reinforce Aave Protocol’s unique and positive culture, share technical knowledge, and attract new community members. These initiatives are aimed at helping to continue the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem by showcasing Aave Protocol’s core values. Thank you for reviewing this proposal and for your earlier questions and positive vote in the snapshot.

# **Motivation**

Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, contributors, and stakeholders.

Although the Aave Protocol has emerged as a leader within DeFi, the sector at large is still in its nascent stages, and Aave should work hard to retain its spot as a leader. For the events proposal from the DAO for 2024, Aave Labs wants to concentrate on proposing fewer but higher-quality events to maximize impact.

# **Specification**

Aave Labs is requesting a budget allocation for 650,000 GHO for events for the remainder of 2024 for EthCC Brussels (45%) and Devcon Bangkok (55%). These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:

1. Hackathons & Bounties: We want to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, and to remain visible and competitive in a growing industry, but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem. We propose to sponsor one ETHGlobal hackathon in Q4 in Bangkok.
2. Open Finance Day: We are hosting Open Finance Day in partnership with key players in DeFi for high quality talks, networking, and light bites. Talks will include members of the DeFi community, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members and service providers.
3. Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences is an opportunity to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge, and industry insights. Typically featuring panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts, side events are designed to strengthen awareness of Aave and GHO technology among strategic audiences, reach new target audiences, and ensure Aave and GHO remain top-of-mind within and outside the community.
4. Merch: Aave Labs seeks to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement and awareness-building efforts as well as to proliferate the new visual identity and the beloved Ronnie ghost. Aave Labs will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials and creation of merchandise people actually wear, use, and love.
5. rAAVE: To celebrate the Aave community’s welcoming culture, we aim to host two more editions of the flagship rAAVE event. Throughout the past years rAAVE has positioned itself to be the most sought after event in the ecosystem. They foster community spirit and create memorable experiences. We will integrate the GHO Pass for ticketing logistics and manage press relations and social media to maximize awareness and inclusion. This year’s events will be hosted at EthCC in Brussels and Devcon in Bangkok. To mitigate some costs for rAAVE, we are planning to potentially obtain co-sponsorship with current or potentially new partners for the Aave ecosystem. Due to the event’s high visibility, it is crucial that if co-sponsorship is obtained, the selected partners are aligned with the Aave Community and this is conducted in a balanced manner.

# **Activations**

| Name | Date | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rAAVE | July & Nov TBD | During the weeks of EthCC & Devcon. rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem. The plan is to host two rAAVEs during the course of this proposal. |
| Open Finance Day | July 9 | In partnership with Chainlink, Uniswap, and Aptos we would host an Open DeFi Day for talks, networking, and light bites during EthCC week. Talks will include members of those communities, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members. |
| ETHGlobal Bangkok | Nov 15-17 | Sponsorship of one ETHGlobal hackathon, ETHGlobal Bangkok, focusing on quality developers. |
| Devcon | Q4 | This will be the event of the year in the Ethereum community. Hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, this event will be one of the most attended web3 events of 2024. |
| Side Events | Q4 | Side events currently being considered include: SheFi Summit (Brussels, Singapore, Bangkok), DeFi Security Summit by Certora during Devcon, Stable Summit Brussels. Funds from any side events that are not confirmed will be rolled over to the next potential side event. |

After covering the aforementioned main sponsorships, any remaining budget will be directed towards side events related to the security of DeFi and smart contract technology. Any excess funds from this grant will be rolled over to be used for events during Q1 2025. A recap on last year’s events was posted to governance last December, here.

Aave Labs shall cover all expenses for its team members, and this proposal does not request any funds for these expenses, or include any compensation for Aave Labs’ work.

# **Next Steps**

- Secure community feedback on ARFC
- Snapshot vote
- If Snapshot is successful, then move to AIP

# **Conclusion**

We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of 650,000 GHO for activations and events for the remainder of 2024 will not only help enrich the Aave Protocol ecosystem, but will foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition.

134,"## Proposal Summary

Following Uniswap’s successful deployment on the Scroll testnet, the Scroll team is proposing that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll's upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official deployment.

Point of Contact: [ Lea Schmitt, E-mail: lea@scroll.io]

## Overview of our Proposal

We propose that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll's upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official, canonical deployment. Uniswap V3 has already been deployed to Scroll’s testnet, and the Uniswap router has processed over 1.8M transactions there.

* Scroll is a bytecode equivalent zk-rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum.
* Scroll is an open-source project developed in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation Privacy and Scaling Explorations organization. It was built with the community, for the community.
* Our community ethos and vision are aligned with Ethereum. We are committed to a secure, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and efficient future that Ethereum offers through our plans to decentralize Scroll sequencers and provers.

We propose that Uniswap will showcase this by integrating Scroll into its user interface.

## Motivation

Uniswap being deployed on multiple Ethereum L2s is integral for encouraging competition and diversity of technical solutions to scale Ethereum. We believe that Uniswap's community and the ecosystem that Scroll strives for are closely aligned. Both projects are building trustless, decentralized, and secure financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone, regardless of merit or location. Deploying to Scroll offers many benefits, including significant user savings, an expanded user base, capturing the zkEVM market, and fostering L2 native innovation.

* This deployment positions Uniswap as an early mover and captures a rapidly growing market as the Ethereum ecosystem gradually shifts to zkEVMs.

* Uniswap on Scroll will integrate closely with Scroll's rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to deploying on our mainnet, and many are deployed on our testnet: AAVE, Lens, the Graph, Covalent, Safe, and Etherscan to name a few. Given the excitement around Scroll and current usage of our testnet, we expect hundreds of projects to deploy on our mainnet post-launch.

* Importantly, Uniswap on Scroll will propel L2 DEX innovation. We are on the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum L1. Scroll will bring new developers and ecosystem integrations to Uniswap.

## Success Criteria

Deployment of Uniswap on Scroll will:
* Increase Uniswap TVL, targeting $100M within two months of deployment Grow * Uniswap order volume
* Enable listing of new assets on Uniswap that are unique to Scroll

Moreover, Scroll will bring its dedicated and expanding developer community to Uniswap, thereby boosting the growth of Uniswap's developer community.

The best way to measure success for Uniswap on Scroll is to focus on TVL and transaction volumes. We think that Scroll can deliver an additional $100M of TVL to Uniswap within two months of launch.

## Protocol Security

ZK-Rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography rather than unreliable crypto-economics.

Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 canonical bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the roll-up mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than relayer-based bridges.

Security is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM, which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we are working with two external auditing companies to audit our bridge code, and we have an in-house security team that continuously reviews our codebase. 

We plan to launch with a timelock delay and a security council to control privileged functions and contract upgrades. Finally, shortly after launch, we will introduce distributed sequencer operators.

## Deployment

After the Temperature Check, we will move forward with deploying Uniswap V3 on our Scroll mainnet, following which we will submit the Governance Proposal with the addition of the deployed contract addresses. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is effortless to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take a few hours.

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the following Uniswap v3 contracts [to be filled in after deployment] to be deemed as the canonical Uniswap deployment on Scroll. This deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to reference the Uniswap v3 Factory contract on Scroll following the process outlined here: [Post-BSL Cross-chain Deployment Process & New Uniswap.eth Subdomain](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20878).

title: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Introducing StrategicAssetManager 
author: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic, @dydymoon & Fermin
created: 2023-07-05

---

# Summary

The `StrategicAssetManager` is a dedicated contract for managing Aave DAO's strategic assets. At launch the `StrategicAssetManager` will manage the DAO's veBAL holding.

# Motivation

Aave DAO is soon to attain a veBAL holding. To maximise the upside for holding the strategic asset, the DAO needs a practical means of managing the asset.

The veBAL holding needs to be continually relocked to optimise goverance and rewards. Gauge votes are weekly and would require numerous AIPs to manage the veBAL effectively. Aave DAO also has an opportunity to participate in Balancer's governance on Snapshot votes via delegating governance rights.

The StrategicAssetManage will also hold the sdCRV position if approved by AIP. Yield generated from each strategic holding can be claimed, swapped and redeposited to compound into each strategy over time. The swaps have MEV protection and can be customised to have defined maximum amount of price impact.

Given the sheer volume and frequency of transactions to be performed, there exists a desire to minimum AIP votes. The StrategicAssetManager contains the ability for the `ShortExecutor` to assign an `AssetManager`. This role can be likened to a Treasury Committee (as suggested Part 4 of SM upgrade publications) and provides the DAO optionality to introduce a committee separte from this proposal once adequate guidelines are in place. 

The contract contains an allow list which implements tight restrictions around which contracts the `AssetManager` role can interact with. Further definition relating to what the `AssetManager` can do will be defined in the [ARFC] publication.

# Specification

The below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the StrategicAssetManager:

* Deposit/withdraw voteEscrow contract 
* Lock/relock B-80BAL-WETH
* Participate in gauge votes
* Delegate governance voting rights
* Allocate boost
* Update boost
* Delegate boost
* Allow boost on Warden 
* List boost on Warden (if the  DAO votes for it)
* Claim protocol fees & other rewards 
* Transfer assets (ie: collector contracts)
* Ability to lock other strategic assets
* Receive assets from the collector
* Receive assets from the Economic Reserve

The contract is upgradeable and controlled by Aave's [`Short Executor`](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/governance-guide#the-short-executor-is-used-for-non-governance-related-proposals-such-as-asset-listing-parameter-upda) role via governance. Each function on the contract can be implemented via the `ShortExecutor` whilst also having the ability to assign and remove, a `AssetManager` role to a community elected address. There is also the possibility of having an IncentiveManager contract that could take on some of the listed functions defined above. These details will be worked through in the future.

# Next Steps

Upon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance. The [ARFC] 
publication will provide greater insights to the functions on the contract and the Treasury Committee will be a separate [ARFC].

Paragraph Summary

Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets.

All art assets and Axie genetic data can be easily accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their own tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe.

While still in early access, Axie is ranked the #1 Ethereum game by daily, weekly, and monthly active users. It has generated over 13,000 ETH in revenue (16M+ USD) so far.

Motivation

Add $AXS as a lending currency into Aave money markets.

Specifications

What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
@Sutton (tw: ssSuttonSss) is an Axie Infinity guild manager and player at @AXGaming_sec .

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
**Axie Infinity Shards(AXS) are an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie Universe. **

Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
By listing $AXS you will be able to leverage an entire nation of gamers.

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
**
** Version 1 First half 2021 / Staking dashboard released
AXS holders can stake their tokens through the staking dashboard and participate in governance votes brought forward by the Sky Mavis team.

These votes will revolve around which teams should receive funding from the ecosystem fund, and how the Community treasury should be distributed.

Version 2 - Early 2022

More on-chain votes about smaller issues.

Potentially changing the way votes are being counted from 1 token 1 vote to Quadratic voting.

Version 3 - September 2023 / Decentralized Organization

AXS holders determine which governance framework should be used and how much should be voted on. Some decisions will not be up for debate such as token supply which is iron-clad in smart contracts.

Potential things that can be voted on:

Should Axie Infinity Limited continue to pay Sky Mavis to develop Axie Infinity?

Should Axie Infinity use the marketplace created by Sky Mavis?

How should the Community Treasury be used to reward AXS holders and the broader Axie community?

Should the Community Treasury funds be attached to any yield farming/staking services such as Yearn.finance or Rari.Capital?

How is the asset currently used?
*. In early 2021, the Community Treasury went live. The Community Treasury began to receive revenues generated by Axie Infinity as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury is by AXS stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. A more detailed overview of the Treasury can be found here 3.

The token has been designed in collaboration with Delphi Digital.
6. Emission schedule
AXS will be unlocked in a pre-determined schedule which lasts for 65 months from the public sale. The initial circulating supply is set to 59,985,000 AXS - 22.22% of the total supply.

139,"CAKE is still too inflationary and reducing the emission by like 0.5 CAKE per block once a month imo is not enough. I understand that the developers are trying to protect the pool APYs but the performance of CAKE and the community feedback I see on Reddit tells me that we need quicker reductions.

I suggest to introduce halvings to CAKE. Automatically reduce the emission by 50% every 864,000 blocks (approx. once a month).

It's the Bitcoin halvings that initiate each crypto bull market and it has proven itself to be a working concept. It doesn't negatively affect the income of miners at all as the halvings result in an increasing price and I think the same will apply to the pool APYs. Farmers earn less CAKE but the price becomes higher, so the APY will fix itself. The only APY that could highly flactuate is of CAKE pools but we will see former farmers leaving or new farmers joining to fix this one as well. Also could we have community votings on adjusting the multiplier of CAKE pools to make these more profitable again.

Halvings would also help investors feeling more safe on their CAKE investment because they know exactly when the next reduction happens and how high this reduction is.

I think that CAKE is essential for PancakeSwap as a platform to survive and hence I highly suggest to put more effort into the success of the token.",bullish

With the upcoming launch of ApeChain, the ApeCoin community is taking a leap forward in creating one of the most robust ecosystems in web3-enhanced gaming, with a focus on content and utility to drive delight amongst gamers, reward developers, and increase the usage of $APE. Making it effortless for games to launch, attract players, and scale on ApeChain is fundamental to the ecosystem’s success. Empowering developers (and therefore gamers and usage) requires the right technology and solutions, and Sequence is excited to propose APE Builder as a platform to supercharge the development of games on ApeChain and spur the utility of $APE.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The ApeCoin community put its trust in ApeChain to further the goals of adoption and usage of $APE and reward the ApeCoin DAO and community. Scalable content and utility are widely recognized as the best practices for driving the use of $APE and similar tokens. However, every new chain, including ApeChain, requires comprehensive technology and solutions for developers and creators to build and launch successful, accessible content. APE Builder uniquely solves these needs and allows developers to build rewarding experiences leveraging ApeChain and $APE.

##### OVERALL COST 
0 ApeCoin

Sequence will not seek any form of compensation from the ApeCoin DAO for the scope of work outlined herein or ongoing support of APE Builder developers in accordance with its access tiers. As mentioned above, APE Builder is free to begin using and creating, with scalable access options for growing projects that align with the incentives of the developer, ApeChain, and the ApeCoin community.

Regarding expectations of the APE Foundation, in helping to realize ApeChain’s goals, we are requesting that the 
Foundation provide:

Branding Authorization
* The permission to use the phrases “APE Builder,” “powering ApeChain Gaming,” as well as all relevant APE marks, for the branding of APE Builder.
* Sequence will work with the stewards of the ApeChain website, once they’re chosen, to allocate and maintain a URL for APE Builder. APE Builder will also be accessible via apechain.sequence.build. Finally, we will also work with the maintainers of the ApeChain website to establish an ecosystem page that will contain complementary solutions, including the many already-created tools for the Ape Community.
* The permission to use the term “ApeKin” as well as all relevant ApeKin marks for use in APE Builder tutorials, UI, and/or marketing materials.
* ApeKin, ApeChain, and ApeCoin’s marks will only be used for the white labeling of the platform, marketing, and tutorials for APE Builder and not commercialized. The Foundation will retain full ownership of these marks.

For select partners, Sequence can extend a unique commercial structure which removes all out of pocket costs for developers and instead further aligns the partnership around the success of the game based on primary and secondary sales.

We are excited to accelerate the adoption of ApeChain and the usage of $APE, and reduce barriers for developers and players to create and enjoy the best games on ApeChain.

146,"##### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z  The Happy Ape, an official MBA #00349, is a premium brand that aims to foster a culture of kindness, compassion and positive mental health in our future generations. This AIP would directly fund the creation of The Happy Ape children’s book and plush, nfc tags, and dapp development on ApeChain creating a unique digi-physical web3 experience for both kids and adults. I believe in the future of ApeCoin and am proudly offering a 20% gross revenue back to the dao based on the initial products sold. With the development of AIP-378 I will use ApeChain and $Ape to create innovative solutions, and integrate them into the products. Bored Labs, LLC. will take on the majority of work that is required, reducing costs needed from the dao and includes but is not limited to, e-commerce site creation [thehappyape.io](thehappyape.io), add $Ape as an accepted payment for our products, develop the majority of ApeChain dapp work, and nfc configuration. All development will be open source and will be fully audited, ideally by boring security dao or in cooperation with Horizen Labs. (edited)

What makes any of this special? Our children’s book will be one of the very first web3 books that can not only teach children and parents about the power of the blockchain, but also onboard them as well using ApeChain. The book is fully written and authored by myself. Here is a quick summary of the book below, or skip it for the juicy tech.

![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/4/4fa2a982de08cd201b68bfb210630005b085a7f8_2_500x500.jpeg)

“The Happy Ape and his friend journey on a daily adventure, gathering bananas amidst the vibrant jungle. Their routine centers around a central tree housing a precious book where their banana counts are meticulously tallied and stored. When theft of the only book shatters their dreams, The Happy Ape crafts a magical book, uniting the jungle’s apes in trust. With every ape receiving a copy of the newfound magical book, no one could lie, steal or cheat because all books have to agree. All of the ape’s lives changed for the better, The Happy Ape and his friend finally could purchase the coveted bouncy ball, playing happily ever after together.”

Such an amazing story isn’t it, how can it get any better? I plan on integrating an nfc tag into every book. Thus delivering a digi-physical experience allowing the user to scan the tag with a compatible mobile device and instantly mint a digital version of their book. This will be a seamless cost free user interaction all powered by our ApeChain (kudos Horizen Labs). In order to do all of this I plan on partnering with IYK, a premier supplier of nfc tags in the web3 space. Their mobile app will allow easy access to our digi-physical experience. This requires the development of smart contracts and a dapp on ApeChain. The development will be achieved through Bored Labs, LLC., and will be open source. I believe that open source development leads to better community adoption, security, and transparency. I have many plans for the evolution of our digi-physical experience as well. IYK allows for OTA updates, easy updates to modules introducing the user to new features like unique stories, animations and more. In addition to this experience I will also have an e-commerce site with the ability to purchase the products with $Ape.

To ensure an unforgettable and joyful experience, I have designed with meticulous attention to detail, a special Happy Ape plush, ensuring they become cherished friends for all. This plush will be approximately 15’’ in length and 6’’ wide. Many plushies are small and not even comfy. Our design ensures a warm, soft, and comfy embrace. The Happy Ape is sure to be a loving companion for so many around the world.

So…“Who are you entrusting valuable DAO funds to, you may wonder, and what qualifies me for it?”

Let me start off by introducing myself. My name is Kevin, I’m 37 and I’m married with 3 kids. 8 yo girl, 6 yo boy, 2 yo girl. I’m a software architect and I’ve been in the web3 space for a few years. I have run a successful software company, Bored Labs, LLC., for 3 years now. I have bookshelves full of children’s books and bags full of plushies. The amount of time I’ve spent reading to my kids and playing with plushies is measured in years! I believe in the power of community and helping others which is why I am here. My passion to share kindness and love back into the world while helping others is what motivates me to do this. I want to provide value back to the various communities connected to apecoin and help them grow as well. I hope that through future collaborations I can work with other communities like bulls on the block and mocaverse to continue creating positive and inspirational children’s books along with animated videos. I believe this is a small stepping stone that will lead to a much larger goal of combining web3 ip use to bring people together.

I added a budget for marketing that will help ensure reach and the success of my brand. Half of the marketing budget will be given back to the buyers of my products. A simple marketing strategy i’ll rely on will be asking product buyers to post images of themselves with my products and reward them with $APE. The other half will be reserved for various marketing efforts as needed.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
 Most importantly ApeCoin DAO will be supporting and empowering our future generations through a unique onboarding digi-physical experience that will help amplify innovative solutions on ApeChain. This AIP will help promote the use and growth of ApeChain and $APE by building one of the first dapps that will help onboard many new users and introduce them to ApeCoin. The Happy Ape products aim to give more visibility to the ApeCoin community in a positive light. We will also be reaching a new audience that we haven’t explored much of. Our products support kindness, compassion, and positive mental health which is something we could all use more of.

We’re offering 20% gross revenue back to the DAO to show gratitude and continued support back to the community. (Detailed under our Overall Cost)

As a result of this proposal, IYK has promised that they would add ApeChain as a supported chain to their application.

This would allow anyone using IYK to use ApeChain as their selected chain to mint nfts on. It would help guide the development and use of digi-physical experiences on ApeChain, and directly fund code that is open source leading to better security and adoption starting within our community. We need a better way for fast adoption of ApeCoin.

I will ensure resources like artists/animators are from the ApeCoin community. With many more future books and animated videos I plan to collaborate with more ApeCoin communities. I promise to innovate new ways of incorporating ApeChain and $Ape into our future products as this is just a stepping stone for us. It’s important that we continue development around ApeChain and $APE. I would be honored to have ApeCoin DAO help us cultivate positivity into many lives of our next generation around the world.

147,"##### ABSTRACT
Exclusive IRL + Live-Streamed Comedy shows for $APE Holders!

If you have $APE in your wallet, you can access the shows, if not, you better get some, sucka.
This AIP offers a fun, additional utility to $APE holders. This is a monthly event that every $APE holder from all over the world can participate in.

Any of our normie friends who want to get in will have to buy and hold $APE to see the show. And with our tech partners NiftyKit (AIP-88) we can make that easy for them.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Laughing Ape, INC will bring needed laughter and fun to the DAO. It’s also an opportunity for $APE holders from around the world to gather for a series of exclusive events fostering camaraderie between DAO members. But look, In between shows y’all can go back to yelling at each other over governance, ok?

Here’s how our Bored Silly AIP fits in with the guiding values of APE Foundation: Boldness: Ape Foundation doesn’t shy away from the weird, the hard, or the new. The Weird: Laughing Ape makes comedians perform live in front of a global, online audience while live-streaming in front of Anon MFers who wear Ape PFPs. You’re gonna tell me that’s not weird?! The New: Laughing Ape is pioneering new ways to integrate live comedy performance and blockchain technology. The Hard: Comedy is hard and so are we. We’re hard AF! Equality: One APE equals one APE. You’ve got 1 $APE, you get into the show. You’ve got 0 ape? GTFO and go buy one. Transparency: Processes and decisions are shared openly with the community. We’ll share our decision making process in how and why we book our shows the way we do. You’re probably not interested but we’re going to tell you anyway! Collective Responsibility: We leave everything better than we found it. Laughing Ape will make the DAO fun for its members. Yes, there is a lot of seriousness needed in the DAO but how about some unseriousness as well? We’ll leave you all in way better spirits than when we found you.

Persistence: Success is an ouroboros, not a straight line. Laughing Ape, INC launched in early 2022 to a big, fat yawn in the bear market. We didn’t care, we didn’t fold and we’re not going anywhere. We have a mission to bring comedy and comedians to Web3 and by gosh we’re going to do it whether you like it or not.

##### OVERALL COST 
We aim to raise $180K USD in $APE to fund a year’s worth of events, covering our talent, technology, production, and marketing budgets.  ![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/aa12a55216ef6d41170165bf7e53971210944d93.png)

149,"## Motivation

Currently Gauntlet manages dynamic fees for any two token pool which has delegated fee control to them on mainnet. With the advent of MetaStable and Stable pools and the increased complexity in managing not only the swap fee but the amplification parameter, Gauntlet wasn't able to accept management of these pool types immediately. They have signaled they are ready now, so we are proceeding with this vote quickly so these pools can start working better for our LP's and for the protocol. 

This proposal would only cover mainnet MetaStable and Stable Pools and only allow Gauntlet to manage the swap fee and amplification parameter. 

## Specification

The [Balancer governance multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) would submit **FOUR** transactions to the [Authorizer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6#code) in order to grant the ability to set swap fees on StablePools and MetaStablePools to the [GAUNTLET_FEE_SETTER](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE4a8ed6c1D8d048bD29A00946BFcf2DB10E7923B#code) and the ability to set amplification factor on StablePools and MetaStablePools to the [GAUNTLET_SAFE](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf4A80929163C5179Ca042E1B292F5EFBBE3D89e6#code).

151,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across four (4) Aave V2 assets. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

## Specification


Our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. 




| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| SNX Loan To Value     | 45%     | 49%     |
| STETH Loan To Value     | 70%     | 73%     |
| UNI Liquidation Bonus    | 7.5%     | 9.0%     |
| UNI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |
| USDC Liquidation Threshold    | 86%     | 88%     |



See below volatility and exchange volume data from 03/31 to 04/20. These are valuable metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. 

|Symbol| 04-20 Volatility| 03-31 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| SNX   | 	 1.157743939      |  1.229825464   | 	 -0.072081525    |  -0.369436026    |
| STETH    |  0.551022399     |   0.683796281    | 	-0.132773882    |  1.594020929 |
| UNI    |   0.862907161    |  0.82903728     |  0.033869881   |  	-0.702985756   |
| USDC    |   0.033054958    |   0.029199586      |  0.003855372    |  	0.062185316   |





## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. 

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

153,"Title: [ARFC] Aave V3 Deployment on Base

Author: @fig - Flipside Crypto

Date: 07-27-2023

---

## **Summary:**

This ARFC proposes the deployment of Aave V3 on the Base upon Mainnet launch, expanding Aave’s presence and tapping into the future growth, budding DeFi ecosystem, and unique users home to Base.

## **Abstract:**

When / if approved by the Aave community, Aave V3 will be deployed on Base Mainnet with a selection of assets for collateral, including wETH, wstETH, cbETH, and USDC. 

This deployment aims to expand Aave to a new ecosystem, capturing the growth and infrastructure allowed by Coinbase’s products and distribution -- providing new opportunities for both ecosystems.

## **Motivation:**

By enabling Base on Aave, it creates valuable (and differentiated) revenue opportunities for Aave, capturing the growth and interest of users who live on the Coinbase platform.

This allows Aave to leverage Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to 110mm+ users and $80B+ assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.

For Base, deploying Aave V3's codebase expands the on-chain experience by fostering a diversity of DeFi platforms and introducing trusted, flagship lending protocols.

## **Specification:**

The ARFC suggests deploying Aave V3 on Base with the following assets for collateral: wETH, wstETH, cbETH, and USDC. 

The table below illustrates the initial suggested risk parameters for each asset, a combination of reccomendations provided by @Gauntlet and @ChaosLabs.

|Risk Parameter|WETH|wstETH|USDC|cbETH|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|NO|NO|
|Enable Borrow|YES|YES|YES|YES|
|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES|
|Emode Category|eth-correlated|eth-correlated|N/A|eth-correlated|
|Loan To Value|80%|80%|82.5%|75%|
|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|82.5%|85%|77.5%|
|Liquidation Bonus|5%|7.5%|5%|7.5%|

156,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust twelve (12) total risk parameters across eight (8) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

In addition, we propose to enable utilizing FEI as a collateral on Aave. The initial parameters for FEI will be an LTV of 50%, a Liquidation Threshold of 60%, and a Liquidation Bonus of 6.5%. Most of the stablecoins that can be used as collateral are more liquid, and our platform's analysis recommends initially capping the amount of collateral that can be liquidatable to the average daily trading volume. If user behavior and market conditions over the coming months continue to show safe conditions for increasing capital efficiency on FEI, we shall recommend ramping up the LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus incrementally.


## Specification

This past week did not see outsized changes in market conditions nor within the Aave protocol. There were slight volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets. Our platform recommends the following set of parameter changes that will decrease liquidation bonuses on several less-utilized assets.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAL Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |
| DPI Loan To Value     | 65%     | 70%     |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| DPI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |
| ENJ Loan To Value    | 60%     | 70%     |
| FEI Loan To Value    | 0%     | 50%     |
| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 0%     | 60%     |
| FEI Liquidation Bonus    | 0%     | 6.5%     |
| MANA Loan To Value    | 65%     | 70%     |
| MKR Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| UNI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |

157,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V3 Avalanche assets.

## Motivation

Chaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. 

Please find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).

You can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Avalanche/recommendations).

The output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to optimize parameters for WAVAX, sAVAX and LINK.e on V3 Avalanche, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a negligible effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)

**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$26K, with a negligible increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**

### Liquidity Analysis:

Based on our analysis, we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support any significant liquidations with the updated parameters.

### Positions Analysis

We have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations.

### Recommendations

| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WAVAX | Liquidation Bonus | 10% | 9% | -1% |
| sAVAX | Liquidation Threshold | 30% | 40% | +10% |
| sAVAX | Loan-to-Value | 20% | 30% | +10% |

title: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Create and Fund GHO Liquidity Committee
Author: @TokenLogic
Dated: 2023-09-08

---

# Summary

This publication presents Aave DAO the opportunity to create and fund the GHO Liquidity Committee for an initial 3 month duration.

# Motivation

Over the coming weeks, we expect the voting base to reallocate gauge votes away from GHO liquidity pools. This is largely due to those voting for GHO pools incurring an opportunity cost by not participating in the bribe market.

If the Aave DAO was to lock all of its BPT for veBAL, the gauge vote is equivalent to 1.8% of veBAL. Even with some voters continuing to support GHO, a good portion of the 7.7% will move to other pools. There is also the impact of [AIP-42](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682) for the DAO to consider. Voting support from external teams is expected to taper beyond what Aave DAO can replace with its own strategic assets. Furthermore, as the liquidity pools continue to grow additional gauge voting support is required to maintain the APR over time. Whilst the Aave Safety Module (SM) has the potential to be a more long term sustained solution, integrating BPTs that contain GHO, this requires time to develop and should not be rushed.

Meanwhile, the [GHO price](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/) is consistently trading between 96 cents and 99 cents. When the liquidity in the GHO/Aave Boosted Pool was withdrawn, the GHO peg improved. This is because the pool was >85% GHO and had minimal USDC, USDT and DAI deposits. Increasing the GHO borrow rate is also expected to support the GHO peg as minting GHO to farm rewards in liquidity pools is less profitable.

![|602x231](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7_4E7_tF8xRZe5tUFyoeXnJB3UbWDs7C7aGaohFzMjxM_aBGLmMvAREOjrtIS5yppMcrUaov3Q18-jIGcnjJk4x17wy91VheIUZSkIa0Y2a9Ay_kLTLRZ0w6zKR8PEpjE3jqJIBPzfF)

The LUSD/GHO pool on Maverick, is also heavily concentrated in GHO and migrating this liquidity to a wider liquidity band pool is expected to also help support the peg.

Creating several concentrated liquidity pools is expected to help improve the GHO peg. These pools will have wide and narrow ranges. Liquidity will need to be migrated from the wide range to the narrow range pool over time. This will require more active management than what on-chain governance allows.

The recent CRV acquisition indicates the DAO will likely be supporting a GHO/crvUSD pool on Curve Finance. The current CRV holding can be used to kick start a pool, however additional support is likely to be needed to continue growing the pool. There is also a GHOFRAXBP pool being setup by the Frax team which can be co-incentivised. Pending how these pools progress, additional scope/budget may be added at a later stage.

Given the time sensitive nature of needing to support GHO liquidity, this publication proposes creating a Liquidity Committee with an initial budget. The committee shall focus solely on GHO liquidity and shall consist of a relatively small highly skilled team.

The Liquidity Committee can support GHO whilst other initiatives are being considered. Even after GHO liquidity pool receipt tokens are integrated into the SM, the Liquidity Committee can participate in bribe markets to boost the yield on the SM integrations.

Longer term the DAO should revisit the impact of the committee and determine if it is still required. Furthermore, the composition of the committee should be revisited at a late date. With this in mind, this proposal suggests the Liquidity Committee’s initial mandate shall last for a 3 month duration.

# Liquidity Strategy

Details on the liquidity strategy are to be detailed in a separate forum post. The liquidity strategy is to be implemented on the following Decentralise Exchanges:

* Balancer
* Maverick
* Uniswap via Bunni

This forum post is to focus on the creation of the Liquidity Committee and associated fundings.

# Performance Measures

The following performance measures are proposed:

* Time GHO peg is above 98.5 cents and 99.0 cents
  * % above/below 98.5 cents over trailing 7 days
  * % above/below 99.0 cents over trailing 7 days
* TVL in GHO Pools on Maverick
  * Target $5M
* TVL in GHO Pools on Uniswap
  * Target $5M
* Improvement in swap size for defined price impact via Cowswap or Paraswap
  * 0.25% and 0.5% price impact to USDC
* TVL in Balancer Liquidity Pools

Target $10M ($5M per pool)

These measures will be shown on the GHO Analytics platform provided by TokenLogic.

# Committee Structure

The Liquidity Committee is to consist of 7 signers and will utilise a 4 of 7 SAFE to implement transactions. To ensure there is smooth operational consistency, there are distinct roles within the committee.

TokenLogic will perform the following function:

* Provide analytics and modelling of the liquidity strategy
* Liaise with teams that support the protocols hosting the GHO liquidity
* Lead & Coordinate the committees weekly activities

All signers are to provide the following support:

* Provide critical feedback / help refine the strategy
* Verify and sign transactions

It should be noted, that actively managing liquidity takes time and effort to stay up to date with the attest events happening across all the protocols supporting GHO liquidity. Verifying transactions as a signer is also a notable time commitment.

# Budget

The initial 3 months funding for the Liquidity Committee is as shown below:

* 406,000 GHO - Liquidity Incentives
* 5 ETH - Gas

A breakdown of the Liquidity Incentive budget is shown below:
![|602x224](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B_P69n971i9uu38kLAiBQKpiESXHTZJc__Q6PKuvWCxxp7ZaHn7zU-eEVpFSHFcD1W2ZurPx49T-W4Dg0fY25krVHC07nZ0_XCQtyylq9LPafWuxv-G4Ca-19mWfE2-URZ-6BL94nIhH)

A more detailed breakdown of the incentive budget and strategy can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801).

There is a nominal 5 ETH allowance included in the budget. This amount was arbitrarily selected and ensures the SAFE & signing wallets are well funded.Some transactions can be executed directly from the SAFE.

Any funds not used shall be returned to the Treasury or rolled over into supporting the next iteration of the Liquidity Committee.

# Specification

A Gnosis Safe will be created, this SAFE will hold funds and implement the quests. A small, high context team is proposed to implement the strategies modelled by the TokenLogic team.

163,"##### ABSTRACT
Ape Express aims to launch the ultimate toolkit for a thriving memecoin ecosystem on ApeChain, empowering users with the tools they need to create, customize and deploy tokens on ApeChain.

With Ape Express no technical skills are needed for safe, unruggable launches. Configure and deploy your token with multiple features in seconds.

Streamlined liquidity management: borrow, deploy, and lock liquidity effortlessly. Developers can deploy an LP using borrowed capital, and launch a coin with a starting market cap of $15K while spending only $300 out of pocket. 
Liquidity loans can be automatically repaid from token taxes, liquidity, or manual payment.

In one place users can create their brand identity, deploy tokens, manage liquidity, build and engage their community. (Think Pump.fun on ApeChain, but way better and less trash. For instance, on Pump.fun tokens start with 1K MC, and never have a chance to reach a DEX. With our system, every launch makes it to the DEX of choice and encourages a free open market on ApeChain.)

Token creators will have an option and be encouraged to airdrop portion of their supply to the holders of the blue chip collections of Yuga ecosystem. BAYC/MAYC/BAKC, CryptoPunks, Kodas, Moonbirds and Mocaverse holders.

This will bring benefit to the holders of these collections and, at the same time, give the upcoming projects an opportunity to reach the high quality user bases that are the lifeblood of these collections.

All of these processes are streamlined in the dapp so that anyone can do it with a few clicks of a button.

This project aims to expand the ApeCoin ecosystem, increase token velocity, TVL and offer new opportunities for the builders in the ApeChain ecosystem.

None of the funds requested in this proposal will be spent on development or team salary. This proposal aims to bootstrap platform liquidity and the Ape Express marketing budget.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
1. Ape Express will give 10% of all gross revenue from platform fees back to the Apecoin DAO’s treasury.
2. Onboarding memecoin degens from other chains and converting this liquidity into $APE.
3. Boosting APE liquidity pairs: Ape Express encourages users to pair their tokens with $APE by automatically converting ETH, USDT, and other assets used on the platform into $APE. By locking APE in LPs we contribute to the overall TVL of the ApeChain.
4. Amplifying on-chain activity: by facilitating fast and easy token creation and trading of memecoins, we drive overall transactions volume. Memecoin trading volume on Solana accounts for $1.2B daily, and over $120M in volume on Base chain. We drive transaction volume to the ApeChain native DEX.
5. Enhancing APE token velocity: gas fees, liquidity loans, and buybacks will all utilize $APE.
6. Backed by The Crypto is a Fun marketing engine. The apes you see above are some of the most prolific memecoin degens in web3. We have our fingers on the pulse of the space and can push our audience over to ApeChain. We run the #1 daily memecoin spaces on CT best believe we will promote ApeChain and Ape Express to the masses.
7. With our novel liquidity loan system we will attract aspiring devs because of the low barrier to entry. They don’t need initial liquidity - they just need a dream and that dog in em

LIST of FEATURES:
1. Token creation
2. Liquidity loans (initial LP)
3. Option to airdrop portion of supply to BAYC/MAYC or other Yuga NFTs.
4. Telegram trading bot - web-facing interface
5. Liquidity lockers
6. Airdrop multi sender
7. Stake APE to earn platform-generated revenue
8. Competitive leaderboard for hot pairs and contest
9. Degen Analytic bots
10. AI Website & brand builder

PLATFORMS & TECHNOLOGIES:
* Smart contracts for deploying tokens
* Smart contracts for lending liquidity & liquidity locker built-in
* Smart contracts and mechanisms for clawing back lent out liquidity

We have created our own set of contracts which interact with each other, giving as much fluidity and flexibility to the system as possible. Users simply pay for token minting, which is dependent on how many features they are including in the token. This acts as initial revenue for the product to safeguard minor expenses with regard to the deploying costs(the user’s token and other related contracts per product deployed), and liquidity rounding errors from the lending activities.

There are several ways for users to repay the loans:
* Direct payment: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, repay a direct 12,500 APE to receive ownership of LP tokens (albeit locked until the lock period is over)
* Tax Tokens: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and passively repay 12,500 APE as taxes are generated from the trading activity of the token. All taxes are diverted to repaying the loan until completed. The creator will then receive ownership of the LP, and release it to their creator’s address when the lock period is over.
* Liquidity Threshold: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and as the liquidity pool grows from net buying activity, a loan with interest is repaid via clawback. This means the user can select a 2x with a 25% interest to repay 12,500 APE when the liquidity pool contains at least 20,000 APE. This approach is generally regarded to be safest when a higher threshold is selected (as high as 5x is available). This process is an automated repayment method.

Another product is the liquidity locker. All created tokens are automatically opted into this feature with a minimum of 30 days, which begins when the loan is repaid in full. Tokens created outside the platform can also use this feature given they make a small payment in APE tokens. The lock period ranges from 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

Finally, Ape Express will be equipped with a mass sender contract and UI. This is for any creator wanting to do an airdrop or presale distribution manually.

Ape Express’ GTM strategy will include a referral/discount coupon program, initially to be issued by team members. In addition, APE stakers (10k tokens staked and up) will be able to generate their own referral and discount codes customizable up to 20% referral/discount mix.

An incentive program will also be put into action if approved for a grant. The tokens with the most activity, measured by volume and holders, will be awarded APE tokens every week for the token’s creator/treasury. These metrics are reset every week to further incentivize only currently active projects or new projects to receive such rewards.

Although we cant stop people from creating NSFW tickers on a permissionless blockchain we will have measures on our backend to hide any racist, hateful or pornographic material from our leaderboards. We can control what is represented on our platform and we will carefully monitor this to make sure we are in line with Apecoin guidelines

*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

164,"What is Pocket Network:

Pocket is a decentralized RPC protocol with a permissionless network of over 45.000 incentivized nodes. This gives us the best resilience in the market with latency comparable to leading centralized providers, while being decentralized. Dapps that use Pocket Network’s RPC get to own their service and the more they use it, the cheaper it gets. As opposed to other providers, rather than paying a monthly fee that is a recurring cost, Dapps using Pocket get allocated RPC service based on a POKT stake, which allows them to own their infra in a liquid way. By using Pocket, Aave will be actively incentivizing decentralization as the more traffic is served by the network, more rewards are generated, causing more nodes to be spun up for the chains in question.

Rationale:

We have learned that Aave currently uses a basket of public RPCs for servicing the end user relays. Team members have expressed the desire to improve this solution as it is not very stable and there are recurring problems in service from these different public RPCs. This is especially problematic for mainnet ETH & Polygon for which POKT provides dedicated RPCs.

By providing Pocket Endpoints to Aave’s user facing RPC we can improve the RPC service level (both latency and % uptime) and contribute to Aave’s decentralization by providing it with the most decentralized infrastructure in the market, making it more resilient and censorship resistant, while allowing Aave to own their service through its stake.

We have developed a contract and method based permissioning method that will be implemented for AAVE’s endpoint, so that it can only be used to interact with AAVE protocol.

Proposal:

We believe a good start is to provide this service with an app stake that’s good for 25M relays (won’t get rate limited if exceeded) and later ramp up depending on performance, user feedback and how much the DAO is willing to invest.

Pocket Network would stake 118,815 POKT on behalf of AAVE DAO. This would be funded as follows:

Budget:

25M Relays:

$POKT 118,815

$POKT price at time of posting: $0.138 USD per POKT

Total: $16,396.47 USD

Goals:

1) Improve stability in Aave’s public facing Web3 infrastructure.
2) Decentralization of Aave’s front end RPC.
3) Give Aave ownership of its RPC service via owning the POKT token.
4) Further promote decentralization in the Aave and crypto communities.
5) Raise awareness of Pocket’s service and mission to decentralize web3 infra.
6) Encourage other projects to decentralize their infra with Pocket Network.

Milestones:

1) Integration: Integration of Aave with Pocket via inclusion of a simple URL addition

Proposal content in short

We propose an addition of Aave’s frontend RPCs to Pocket Network, in order to solve stability problems currently experienced in the use of public RPC’s (especially on mainnet), as expressed by the community.

We are offering an endpoint with a stake for 25M relays that won’t get rate limited and to be ramped up in a phased manner.

To fund this we are asking the AAVE community the funds to buy 118,815 $POKT which will represent their service stake, allowing for AAVE to send up to 25M Relays per day.",bearish

**Author: [@AaveCompanies](https://governance.aave.com/u/aavecompanies)**

**Date: 12th July 2023**

## **Summary**

This ARFC proposes implementing the dedicated GHO Steward as a dynamic parameter change mechanism to ensure efficient risk management and support the peg of Aave Protocol’s native multi-collateral stablecoin GHO during the initial stages.

## **Motivation**

### **Introduction**

As the Aave DAO prepares for the introduction of GHO, it is crucial for the community to consider implementing a mechanism that offers greater agility to adjust risk parameters in the initial stages of launch.

To support the maintenance of the peg, the proposed GHO Steward multisig acts as a dynamic parameter change mechanism. It enables swift adjustments to risk parameters in the form of scoped governance delegation where the full governance process could potentially be time-consuming and hinder timely response to evolving circumstances.

By employing this mechanism, the Aave Protocol ensures transparency and enables flexible parameter changes through decentralized governance. This approach reinforces commitment to preserving the peg and effectively addressing market challenges that may arise upon the launch of GHO.

### **Key Terms**

The “bucket capacity” refers to the maximum amount of GHO that can be minted by a Facilitator. The ability to adapt the bucket capacity by adjusting supply supports stability by ensuring that available supply meets demand.

The “borrow rate” refers to the interest rate paid when borrowing GHO. The borrowing rate may also be used to support stability because of its impact on demand.

You can learn more about GHO in the docs [here](https://docs.gho.xyz/).

### **GHO Steward Permissions**

Aave V3 provides a high level of granularity around permissions. Building on the concept of [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/4), it is proposed that a dedicated GHO Steward multisig be introduced to support the initial GHO governance risk mechanism to enable the implementation of agile parameter changes in the form of scoped governance delegation.

The GHO Steward multisig would be 2/2 and would include the DAO’s risk providers Chaos Labs and Gauntlet.

The GHO Steward would be capable of adjusting predefined parameters including: increasing the bucket capacity (by up to 100%) and changing the borrow rate (by up to 100 basis points in either direction) in a single change. Parameter updates could only occur once every 5 days per the parameter.

It is proposed that the GHO Steward would be deactivated 90 days after the passing of this proposal. However, the DAO can vote to renew the GHO Steward for another 90 days if deemed necessary. The DAO can also vote to remove the GHO Steward at any time.

### **Governance Process**

This proposal emphasizes the importance of decentralization and community involvement in the decision-making process, fostering a robust and inclusive ecosystem. The GHO Risk Steward would enable agile parameter changes for GHO; however, decisions shouldn’t be made in isolation and should go through a lean governance process.

The proposed lean process is as follows:

1. Proposal on the Governance Forum explaining the rationale of the proposed action.
2. Snapshot requirements:
    
    a. 24-hour duration starting from the posting of the proposal
    
    b. Quorum 250,000 AAVE
    
    c. A minimum of 70% of votes FOR the change
    
3. Change can be enacted as soon as the proposal passes Snapshot.

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the GHO Steward serves as an initial agile parameter change mechanism driven by decentralized governance. It highlights the Aave Protocol’s commitment to maintaining GHO stability and addressing market challenges during the launch period.

While the proposal acknowledges the potential for a more dynamic rate-changing governance model in the future, the current framework allows the DAO to effectively manage GHO’s parameters in the short term.

## **Specification**

### **Capabilities:**

1. **Capacity Increase:** It can increase the bucket capacity by up to 100%. This is strictly an upward adjustment; the capacity cannot be decreased by the GHO Steward.
2. **Borrow Rate Adjustment:** It can adjust the borrow rate by up to 1%, either upwards or downwards.

### **Configuration:**

1. **Permissions:** The GHO Steward is granted PoolAdmin in the Aave Protocol and BucketManager for the GHO token.
2. **Risk Council:** This Multisig is solely responsible for triggering actions through the GHO Steward contract. The address of this entity cannot be changed.
3. **Execution Time Delay:** Any parameter change made by the GHO Steward contract, such as increasing bucket capacity or adjusting the borrow rate, is limited to once within the time delay period. e.g.,GHO Steward can only change a parameter once 5 days have passed since the last parameter change for that specific parameter.
4. **Lifespan:** The GHO Steward contract will initially only have a lifespan of 90 days. The lifespan is designed to ensure regular review of the necessity of this approach.
5. **Steward Lifespan Extension:** The DAO can extend the lifespan of the GHO Steward for additional 90-day periods as many times as it wants.

176,"Proposal to add support for stMATIC on Aave V3 Polygon market

Overview

This is a proposal to add stMATIC to the Polygon v3 market.

Aave governance recently added stETH to the Ethereum v2 market with great success, having a market size of $1.43 billion. The stMATIC token is similar but differs in one important aspect. Instead of being a rebasing token like stETH, it simply becomes more expensive over time relative to MATIC as it accrues yield.

Since Aave governance enjoyed stETH, I would venture to guess they will like stMATIC as well.

In addition, this will unlock leveraged MATIC yield positions similar to the ETHMAXY token by the Galleon DAO (https://blog.galleon.community/the-eth-max-yield-index-is-live-on-ethereum-df6dc9bbc5b4?gi=970b8b8e4f52).

Background

PoLido is a DAO governed liquid staking protocol for the Polygon PoS chain. It allows users to stake their MATIC tokens on the Ethereum mainnet and immediately get the representation of their share in the form of stMATIC token without maintaining staking infrastructure. Users will get staking rewards and still control and utilize their stMATIC tokens in secondary markets on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon.

MATIC tokens will be delegated across validators that are registered and accepted by the DAO inside PoLido protocol.

Node operators don’t have direct access to the delegated assets. They are just providing infrastructure and getting rewards in return. Assets are controlled by PoLido core smart contracts exclusively.

The goal is to help with Polygon decentralization and integrate stMATIC with the variety of protocols and DeFi applications on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon PoS chain.

In short, Lido for Polygon is enabling users to:

Stake their MATIC tokens in a decentralized and secure way
Use their stMATIC on the secondary market
Do all of the above simply and easily with a click of a button on the UI
Additional value PoLido can bring to the Polygon ecosystem is decentralizing stake distribution, and getting more capital efficiency in the ecosystem — enabling staked MATIC to participate in DeFi on Polygon.

stMATIC token
Polygonscan Link:
https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3a58a54c066fdc0f2d55fc9c89f0415c92ebf3c4

stMATIC is an ERC20 token that represents the account’s share of the total suuply of MATIC tokens inside PoLido system. It is a non-rebasable token, which means that the amount of tokens in the user’s wallet is not going to change. During time, the value of this token is changing, since the amount of MATIC tokens inside the protocol is not constant.

Paramenters
Using the relative parameter adjustments between ETH and stETH, I propose the following for stMATIC. These will be subject to change with more discussion. 

Max LTV: 55%
Liquidation threshold: 62%
Liquidation penalty: 15%

177,"# Simple Summary
Gauntlet proposes adjusting interest rate parameters for the Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism Aave V3 markets. Tokens impacted include USDC, USDT, EURS, WBTC, DPI, and CRV. If these changes are approved, our models indicate that it could lead to over $135k in annualized protocol revenue growth. Forum post can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-interest-rate-curve-recommendations-from-gauntlet-2023-04-27/12921).

# Abstract
Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet’s platform has evaluated all assets on Aave V3’s active markets and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. Our methodology makes data-informed decisions around setting borrower and supplier interest rates when market conditions require the protocol to reduce risk or when strategic opportunities present themselves to increase protocol revenue without materially impacting risk. This analysis further finetunes the interest rate curves of Aave V3 across the Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism markets.

## Objectives
Among other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve:

1. **mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool**
2. **build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future**

As a secondary objective, we want to **optimize the user experience of Aave's borrowers and suppliers**.

--------------

This proposal aims to establish a Financial Management Working Group (FMWG) at Aave DAO with the goal of enhancing financial reporting and auditing, GHO stablecoin management, treasury management as well as Safety Module management. The FMWG will be composed of up to five service providers elected through an RFP process outlined below. The approved service providers will each be responsible for one of the key areas/scopes within the FMWG.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We propose a collaborative-first approach involving multiple service providers to help manage the various core aspects of Aave DAO's financials. With this, we hope to achieve more optimal outcomes by leveraging the strengths and experience of several service providers.

To ensure accountability and progress tracking, a Project Management scope will also be introduced that ties together the various scopes.

Regular reports published on the Forum and dashboards that allow community members to check in on key aspects of the DAO's financial performance round out the picture.

Establishing this working group, sets a precedent for excellence in the DAO space and further underlines Aave's position as an industry leader. It also ensures its long-term survival and makes sure token holders are set up in the best way possible.

Currently, numerous Aave DAO proposals deal with capital allocation. However, the DAO often lacks a comprehensive understanding of the financial impact and intrinsic value of these propositions.

To address this, the DAO would greatly benefit from a dedicated service provider focused solely on Financial Reporting and Accounting. This would empower governance participants to make decisions based on the best possible data and analysis.

Applicants should cover the following:

-   Provide insights into on-chain financials

-   Develop a DAO-wide budget so the impact and performance of governance output can be tracked

-   Produce regular financial reports, either monthly or quarterly, to ensure transparency

-   Create and maintain up-to-date dashboards reflecting key parameters for the community

-   Analyze the DAO's finances, including grants and operational expenses

-   Provide feedback on the financial impact of major proposals

-   Collaborate closely with other key stakeholders in the DAO

181,"#### ABSTRACT

This AIP aims to build an ecosystem of GameFi NFT-based DAOs and vault, powered by ApeCoin. Using smart contract wallets, the AIP will establish a lend/borrow NFT assets & rewards vault for the game community.

The ApeDAO wanted to implement active user engagement in a Game community by enabling GameFi Segment with the DAO and smart contract Wallets. As NFT-based P2E games grow in popularity, NFT asset management ecosystems - driven by the community - are becoming essential, as they allow asset rotation among active community members. This maximizes the potential of NFT DeFi.

Gamified DAOs are built in a way that only allows active wallets to keep the assets and continue participating in the game. For inactive assets, the DAO will run a vote to pull them from the member wallets and into the vault. The assets will later be reallocated to other members, as per the policy set by the DAO members.

This approach increases NFT scarcity and price in the market which will eventually attract more buyers and investment in the ApeCoin-driven DAO community. Furthermore, the DAO will offer incentives to participating voters, creating a constructive cycle of engagement.

All the DAO processes will run on a predefined set of rules to streamline community governance.

Each game community will have its own DAO and members where rules of governance and different policies are defined by the community members. Once the governance is established, a dedicated vault is created/ deployed for each community to lend their assets either as an individual member or through a community proposal for pooled resources. The community can buy assets for the vault to be later lent to the players and earn rewards based on a distribution set by the DAO distribution policy.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

Only the APE Coinholder will have the opportunity to create and engage in game DAO and vaults. Thus, anyone who plays games using the vault assets must hold APE coins, the DAO member will receive a share of rewards, in some cases without engaging in the game directly (feature to be explored at a later stage).

* Bring in new members to the Ape community and effectively grow the community
* Enable a safe and fair lending system to “put to work” all NFTs, thus increasing their use cases, value, and market dynamics
* Attract more players to the Ape-related games through the ApeDAOs and large investors and guilds
* Make the ApeCoin ecosystem, in general, more guild-friendly; large investors and guilds would feel more motivated on investing in Ape-related NFTs and projects and bringing their network into the action

#### OVERALL COST

**$520k denominated in APE coins**

2m STZ tokens will be given to the ApeDAO as partnership value, equivalent to 2.02% of the token's total supply.

**Title**: *[ARFC] BGD. Security budget request - December 2023*

**Author**: *BGD Labs (@bgdlabs)*

**Date**: *2023-12-8*

---

## Summary
Request for a budget of $121’200 for 2 security review procedures on Aave, together with a refund of $30’000 to BGD for the Aave Governance v3 extra voting tokens audit.A


**Amounting a grand total of $151'200**.


## Motivation
Part of [our scope Aave <> BGD Phase II](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-bored-ghosts-developing-phase-2/14484#scope-6) is the planning, engagement, and coordination with security partners of the DAO.

During the previous year and a half, Aave was in a pretty intensive delivery phase (Aave v3 improvements, GHO, Aave Governance v3, a.DI), and we thought it was appropriate to have continuous engagement with 2 security firms like Certora and SigmaPrime.

Even if this worked well, and [we still think that Certora should stay with a continuous engagement](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-continuous-security-proposal-aave-certora/15732/4), we also think that there is room for optimisation, and it is a good idea to do more ad-hoc requests for the security budget, depending on the needs.

This ARFC is an initial request, for budget required in the short term on item part of our development services scope, together with another more general we consider pretty important.

## Specification
This request has 3 components, which we want to explain to the community:

---

**1. Compensation for Mixbytes review of Governance v3 tokens**

During the activation of Aave Governance v3 on October 17th, we detected a problem with the voting assets, which required the cancellation of the proposal, the development of a fix, and re-apply security procedures.

Given that it was already audited code, we also decided to do an extra security review by another security firm, Mixbytes.

For the sake of speed and reducing bureaucratic blockers, **BGD paid for the cost of said security review of $30’000, and now we will include on this proposal a refund request for that amount**.

---

**2. Compensation for security review on a feature of Aave 3.1**

Also part of our Phase 2 scope is to do a series of improvements to Aave v3, in order to reach a 3.1 version, from the current 3.0.2.

Generally, we are confident with Certora reviewing all the planned items until now, but there is one exception (an specific feature) to which we thought an extra review was required, and we engaged Emanuele Ricci (@StErMi), a top-level security researcher with knowledge of Aave to do it.
We will be publishing soon everything to be included into v3.1.

Same as with Mixbytes, BGD has paid the cost of said security review of $12’000, and now we include the refund request on this proposal.

---

**3. Engagement with Spearbit for Aave v3 ad-hoc review**

Aave v2/v3 is a production system with billions of dollars in size, and one of the most evaluated protocols security-wise.
However, security is a continuous process, and always worth it to improve whenever it feels necessary.

During the last 1-2 months, we have noticed different security exploits in the space following similar patterns. None of them affected Aave, but apart from our continuous analysis of the system security-wise, we think it is necessary to do an extra round of review in critical parts of Aave, for additional assurance.

We have coordinated an engagement for this review scope with Spearbit, one of the leading security firms in the space, that will involve 3 of their top researchers checking in-depth different components that we identify as critical on Aave.

This engagement is scheduled to start in the second part of December, and different from the others, the payment requested in the proposal will be direct to Spearbit, for an amount of $109’200.

From a technical perspective:
- The proposal will send $42'000 to BGD as compensation for the expenses of part 1) and 2).
- $109'200 will be sent to a Spearbit wallet, to compensate for the services to be provided on part 3).

183,"## Summary

This proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard USDP in isolation mode to the Ethereum Aave V3 Market.

## Motivation

As part of the community efforts on the V2 to V3 migration, Chaos Labs proposed a [multi-phased plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636) to promote V3 adoption. As per this plan, Chaos Labs proposes to list USDP on Aave V3 on Ethereum. USDP is currently listed on V2 Ethereum as a non-collateral asset.

### Liquidity and Market Cap

When analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at data from the past 180 days. The average market cap of USDP over the past 180 days was ~$883M, and the average daily trading volume was ~$8.7M (CeFi & DeFi). 

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreicffv66o5w2u2l6vdu6u2mfdobf4dgnla2k42osux3s7pycwyuj6m)
    

### **Liquidation Threshold**

Analyzing USDP price volatility over the past, we observed daily annualized volatility of 2.79% and 30-day annualized volatility of 1.63%. Considering this volatility and the history of USDP on other networks, we recommend an initial LT of 75%.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreifydbyneeuh24uqgfmss6u3ppuyqevx6eyau44dpmgfurrtoj4h6a)
    

We recommend listing USDP as borrowable, as we do not observe a significant risk to the protocol by allowing to borrow of USDP, as long as it is bound by a well-defined cap.

### **Debt Ceiling**

Following [Chaos Labs’ Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440), we recommend an initial debt ceiling of $3.3M. Under the methodology for Isolation Mode, we consider two levels of probabilities for extreme price drops - Medium-High and High. We estimate the probability of an extreme price drop for USDP as Medium-High. Given this debt ceiling, we do not identify a profitable attack vector under the current liquidity levels.

### **Supply Cap, Borrow Cap, and Liquidation Bonus**

When evaluating the initial supply caps for migrated assets from Aave V2 Market, we carefully analyze the latest supply for the asset and consider it as the demand for supplying the asset. We then ensure that this amount is aligned with the current liquidity on-chain. 

Furthermore, we take into account the debt ceiling calculated using our methodology and derive a supply cap that aligns with the debt ceiling. This approach is aimed at minimizing the risks associated with listing assets while ensuring that the supply cap is aligned with the overall liquidity of the platform and the potential risks that the asset might pose to the protocol.

Accordingly, We recommend a supply cap of 5M USDP and a borrow cap of 4M USDP.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiepqthcxzlsc3zuuibihdcrlcmnr26t3bk2ne63wow2ulxqtysfqe)
    

Given the concentrated liquidity of USDP, we recommend a 5% Liquidation Bonus.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreihoqvhbm6yzcd5v4f4wexexebeyvrskltejfr5u373jvx7vsv5ttm)
    

For the **Reserve Factor**, **Liquidation Protocol Fee**, and **Interest Rate curves**, we recommend aligning the parameters to the other stablecoins currently on Ethereum V3.

184,"## Summary
This Snapshot aims to officially capture the community's agreement on adopting Chainlink Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to initiate the GHO cross-chain strategy. The details of the rollout plan and the configuration of risk parameters remain subjects for future governance discussions.

## Motivation
The current limitation of GHO, which is primarily accessible only via minting on the Ethereum mainnet or through secondary markets, represents a significant constraint in its potential reach and utility across DeFi. We believe the future of GHO is to become a multichain asset where users can interact across various networks using GHO. Moving cross-chain increases the accessibility and liquidity of GHO for a larger spectrum of users.

The current moment is ideal for GHO to venture into new frontiers, and to facilitate this, it is essential to employ a solution that empowers users and stimulates growth. CCIP stands out for its high-speed and cost-effective token bridging, extensible compatibility to both EVM and non-EVM networks, ease of integration, and robust risk mechanisms. Aave Labs suggests implementing a canonical, unified cross-chain strategy for GHO using Chainlink's CCIP.

## Specification
Aave Labs proposes using Chainlink [CCIP infrastructure](https://docs.chain.link/ccip) to move GHO across blockchain networks. This will allow the seamless transfer of the GHO token between source and destination networks. CCIP transfers tokens by locking/burning on the source chain and then releasing/minting on the destination network. Cross-chain GHO uses a combination of lock/release and mint/burn models, backing the aggregated liquidity across chains with locked GHO on Ethereum. Every destination chain will have a canonical version of the GHO token and an Aave Governance controlled facilitator with a specific bucket capacity.
- Transferring GHO from Ethereum to another chain: GHO tokens get locked in a vault contract on Ethereum, GHO tokens get minted via Facilitator on the destination chain.
- Transferring GHO from another chain to Ethereum: GHO tokens get burned via Facilitator on the other chain, GHO tokens get released from the vault contract on Ethereum.
- Transfering GHO from one chain to another (none of them are Ethereum): GHO tokens get burned via Facilitator on source chain, minted via Facilitator on destination chain.

![examples-ccip.png](ipfs://bafkreih46kvo7rrl4ylyobxyiqxis2kvplo7tqd223fje5zm2nooeut3eu)

Each network will have a canonical version of GHO and a facilitator, controlled by Aave Governance, that will manage facilitator buckets and onboard GHO liquidity from Ethereum. The liquidity on each network will depend on the bucket capacity of the Facilitator and CCIP configuration (e.g. [rate limit](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/architecture#token-pool-rate-limit)). The total amount of liquidity across chains is always less than or equal to the amount of GHO tokens locked on Ethereum.

## Next Steps
Once the community signals its consent for the implementation of CCIP to initiate the cross-chain strategy for GHO, the subsequent actions will be undertaken:
- Initiate technical implementation process
- Perform a thorough technical review to select the optimal networks for deployment.
- Formulate a strategic rollout plan for the GHO cross-chain approach, in partnership with Risk Providers.",bearish

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market 

Author: [@mv_Trident]

Created: 2023-12-18

---

# Summary

This AIP proposes the onboarding of the PYUSD stablecoin, minted by Paxos Trust Company, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.

# Motivation

PYUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin minted through Paxos. While it’s still young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $230M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:

- Build synergies between Aave and PYUSD.
- Offer Aave users an additional stablecoin option.
- Strengthen the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin. (Trident may explore the deployment of a PYUSD/GHO pool)

We propose a PYUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.

If the community deems that PYUSD as collateral is immediately viable we stand ready to support that role on day one; otherwise following PYUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for PYUSD at a later stage.

# Specification

Chainlink Oracle: [https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/PYUSD-usd](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/pyusd-usd)

We propose the following parameters for a PYUSD onboarding:

Borrow Cap (PYUSD)	20M

*Liquidity and Market Cap*

The PYUSD token was introduced a few months ago, and since its launch, its market cap has increased to approximately $230million. Over the coming weeks the pool will be scaled further with incentives in order to reach the necessary liquidity to support the proposed market parameters.

![PayPal USD Price Chart.png](ipfs://bafkreihqq36bcffddfsnmcz4m4gda4pcopqktjs4rdneanq4q4pggkesfm)
    
When analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at the available historical data. The 30 Day average Market Cap of PYUSD is $170M with a 30 day average volume of $4.7M. Over the last 7 days, the average Market cap has climbed to $209M with the same period seeing an average volume of $8.7M, the volume and aum increase is on the back of prior stakeholder efforts and we expect both to grow meaningfully in the coming weeks.

 
![coming weeks.png](ipfs://bafkreifqcajvizwsxvoiinqyppnncfzmdqk56dirdnwlfolhlwamonktva)
    

With peg holding well since inception, an average intra-day volatility of ~0.01%, and the ability of onboarded institutional investors to redeem PYUSD 1:1 with Paxos, we see low risk related to the stability of PYUSD’s price.

*Initial Supply and Borrow Caps*

PYUSD circulating supply is ~$230M. Given PYUSD is a new asset listing, we recommend adopting a conservative approach for setting supply and borrow caps for PYUSD, which gives room to expand caps should cap usage be elevated. We recommend a supply cap of 25M and a borrow cap of 20M.

*Variable Borrow Rate*

We recommend setting slope 1 to 7% due to current on-chain stable yield opportunities which we believe will remain viable for the foreseeable future.

*Borrowable in Isolation*

We do not see excess risk with enabling PYUSD being borrowable in isolation. If the community wishes to take a more conservative stance, it may wish to only limit PYUSD borrowing to non-isolated collateral.

title: [ARFC] Aave Finance Steward
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
created: 2024-05-03

# Summary

Building upon the success of the [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-risk-steward-phase-1-capsplusrisksteward/12602), this publication proposes creating a smart contract to enable ""Finance Stewards"" to execute on behalf of the DAO pre-approved and budgeted operations.

This proposal also marks a step forward in defining the asset management framework for Aave DAO, as introduced in the TokenLogic and karpatkey service provider [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633).

# Motivation

To progressively streamline the management of the Aave DAO's funds by shifting approved ARFC proposals from on-chain vote to a trusted Finance Steward implementation.

The Finance Steward is a smart contract that will act as admin of the collector, it can do the exact same operations as the DAO Executor. The DAO has full ownership of the contract which grants it the ability to delegate permissions and budget specific actions to a Guardian, the Finance team. 

The Finance Steward will enable the DAO to define a core set of financial capabilities to be carried out within strict role-based guardrails. As the role matures or new use cases arise, we plan to bring forward additional capabilities for the DAO to discuss.

Efforts not included in the Finance Steward or being developed will still be covered through the normal governance process. This may include the recommendation to introduce purpose-specific safe multisigs with the intent to minimise governance burden (e.g. ALC, APE, etc…).  This design will map frequent key finance operations to a role-based governance-controlled solution, frequent but long-tail use cases to trust-minimised and efficient multisigs; and important, infrequent or strategic discussions to the full governance process.


It is relatively simple for the Aave DAO to grant granular control over the management of various parameters to Finance Stewards, but the complexity comes in term of decentralisation and self-protection of the protocol.

The initial introduction of the Finance Steward role will enable the tasks detailed in the Specifications to be performed. 

# Specification

## Finance Steward v1.0 (Mainnet Only)

The initial Finance Steward implementation will work the following way:

* A `FinanceSteward` smart contract will be created with an Owner and a Guardian. The Owner will be the DAO.
* Guardian of the FinanceSteward contract will be a multisig with multiple signers, to be determined by the DAO.
* The Collector Contract will be upgraded to have a system of roles whereby the same admin role can be held by multiple addresses, eg: FUNDS_ADMIN by the DAO's Executor and the FINANCE_STEWARD by the multisig proposed earlier.
* Guardian can migrate assets from v2 and deposit into v3 to support seamless migration of the DAOs assets over time.
* Guardian can be granted the ability to use the Aave Swapper to exchange assets held in the Treasury
* Guardian can withdraw and deposit into V3.
* Guardian can be granted the ability to transfer and stream tokens to pre-approved addresses within a budget, for example:
    * ACI [Frontier](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-introducing-frontier-staking-as-a-service-for-the-aave-dao/16225) Program
    * ACI [Merit](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-a-new-aave-alignment-user-reward-system/16646) Program

The functionality will have the following limitations, enforced on-chain:

* For each Aave market reserve, a [minimum balance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aaysvP2velw0hCBhH3huplumNwuN0FaA_bAZZTdjsmg/edit?usp=sharing) will remain in the collector
* Tokens to swap to will be pre-approved by the DAO
* Addresses to transfer to will be pre-approved
* Tokens to transfer out of the Collector have a pre-defined budget set by the DAO

## Future Phased Functionality Introduction

The following permissioned functionality is intended to be gradually introduced over time to further streamline the implementation of the DAO's financial transactions.

* AAVE Protocol interactions in cross-chain deployments
* Bridging from and to other chains

Some of the above updates are pending other contracts to be delivered.

The DAO relies on two main systems that dictate and govern the entire DAO. Snapshot & Discourse. However, newcomers to the DAO may not be familiar with these systems, and the lack of instructional material available to them, such as video content, infographics, or live training, can lead to confusion, inactivity, and low participation (the ApeCoin DAO may be their first ever interaction with a DAO). This leaves new DAO members on their own to find their way around. This AIP aims to provide a central, easy to understand source of information for new members to use as a reference. Getting new members of the DAO up to speed and answering basic questions on day one will benefit the DAO across the board.

### [TEMP CHECK]  Deploy an Etherfi/Stablecoin Aave v3 Instance 
### Author: ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)
###  Date: 2024-07-05

---

## Summary:
This proposal suggests deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on providing liquidity for weETH holders to borrow stablecoins.

## Motivation
The demand for borrowing wETH on Aave using weETH as collateral is extremely high, with caps being filled within minutes each week.

While this $2B growth is welcomed and responsible for ~$12.5M yearly revenue (at current ETH prices) for the DAO, it has created some frustration for significant users looking to borrow stablecoins using their weETH as collateral.

With this asset being constantly at cap, users are wary of leveraging Aave for this use case as they have legitimate concerns about their ability to add more collateral/debt to (de)leverage following market conditions.

To provide weETH holders with more suitable options, we propose creating a dedicated weETH/stablecoin Aave v3 Instance. 

This market also lays the groundwork for future integrations & synergies with EtherFi's Cash product.

## Specification

The proposed weETH/Stablecoin Aave v3 instance will implement the following:

- The market will include weETH, USDC, and a new GHO facilitator.

This GHO facilitator will be one of the highest quality collateral having only an eth-correlated asset as collateral.

- This market will not have E-Mode, but due to its focused nature and limitation of cross-collaterals, it's proposed to have a higher LTV/LT status for weETH than for the main instance.

- For the first 6 months, the GHO borrow rate will be slightly lower than on the main Aave instance to kickstart liquidity & boost demand.
 
The risk steward will dynamically adjust weETH supply caps based on stablecoin liquidity to ensure stablecoin borrowing remains viable.

- The GHO stewards will maintain the Exposure and borrow caps of this new GHO facilitator to keep tight control on GHO peg & liquidity.

In addition, we propose that the Aave DAO consider the following:

- Introduce a stablecoin deposit incentive program to kickstart stablecoin liquidity in this new instance using Merit or other initiatives to be discussed.

The deployment will be handled by Catapulta on behalf of the Aave DAO.

## Disclaimer

The ACI has not been compensated by Etherfi for the publication of this proposal.

The ACI and several ACI team members are both weETH and ETHFI holders.

## Next Steps
1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2. If the Snapshot outcome is Yae, escalate to the ARFC stage.
3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.
4. If the ARFC snapshot passes, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement.

195,"Enable agEUR as a collateral in isolation mode on AAVE V3 on Polygon.

## Summary

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient.
The protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. 

agEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there.

At the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero.

There are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/polygon/pools/0x3fa147d6309abeb5c1316f7d8a7d8bd023e0cd80) and on [Curve](https://polygon.curve.fi/factory/209). 
Besides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.

Stablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism.

The stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).
The protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.

agEUR has a Chainlink feed on Polygon with USD.

## Audits

We have had four different audits which can be found [here](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits)

## Benefits for Aave V3

agEUR is already supported in efficiency mode with other stablecoins which should technically allow people to take leverage on Forex, or to arb more easily stablecoins at peg.

One thing that is not supported at the moment is borrowing against agEUR as a collateral. This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the € and short the $ through agEUR.

Right now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the €. This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future.

Relative to the size of agEUR on Aave, there’s also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment.

Doing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.



## Risk Parameters

With the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters.

V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon

**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**  
See Benefits for Aave section.

**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?).**  

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, it is ruled by the ANGLE token and more generally by the veANGLE token. Like many other projects, Angle DAO has indeed adopted the ve tokenomics. 

The platform was released [on November 3rd 2021.](https://blog.angle.money/angle-is-live-on-the-ethereum-mainnet-a8253162daf0).
ANGLE locking went live [in January](https://blog.angle.money/veangle-is-live-on-mainnet-4d702fcf7584). Votes by veANGLE holders are implemented by a 4/6 multisig composed of 3 core team members (including myself), [Julien Bouteloup](https://twitter.com/bneiluj), [0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xMaki) and [SebVentures](https://twitter.com/SebVentures).

**5. How is the asset currently used?**  

The asset is a € stablecoin. It is used by people as a means of exchange to pay in Euros in DeFi, or to keep a stable asset value in reserves before aping in elsewhere.

It is also used as a way to get yield in many places in DeFi

**6. Emission schedule**  

Token can only be issued following the rules of the protocol on mainnet: at oracle value if someone has provided either USDC, DAI, FEI, FRAX, or wETH. agEUR can also be borrowed from Angle Borrowing module at a 0.5% rate. 
There’s no emission schedule for the token.

**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**  

agEUR token contract on mainnet is upgradeable and can be upgraded by the [multisig ](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xdC4e6DFe07EFCa50a197DF15D9200883eF4Eb1c8/balances) described above.
agEUR on Polygon can also be upgraded by a [multisig on Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xdA2D2f638D6fcbE306236583845e5822554c02EA).

**8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**

-   **Market Cap**: €48.7m circulating, €3.7m on Polygon, market cap = FDV
-   **24h Volume**: $4m (from [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ageur?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=WkIOj7Yl4CFERft4Q_gDG0LX9Ge3tf4LZpdCsXbQyng-1639642129-0-gaNycGzNCVE)) and this does not take into account Curve liquidity

Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.
Proposal
Founded in 2019, Metis launched its Layer 2 mainnet on November 19, 2021. We are building a hub for the entire Web3 economy in 3 stages: Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution with fast and cheap transactions; no-code integration via a middleware layer powered by smart contract templates; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) infrastructure enabling both blockchain and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain, with all the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.
A mere eight weeks after launching Andromeda mainnet, Metis TVL surpassed the majority of its competitors, surging to the #3 spot as measured by L2Beat and reaching $500M+ TVL. As the fastest growing L2, Metis has taken the blockchain world by storm with its Optimistic Rollup technology, EVM-Equivalence, and incredible mutually-incentivized ecosystem. With a robust and secure infrastructure, a self-deployed Graph node, multiple oracle providers, on-chain explorers, and a dedicated integrations team ready to assist throughout every step of the porting process, Metis is ready for Aave integration.
Metis envisions and supports a multichain future and seeks to invite Aave to expand its own mission of creating a multichain future, by having Aave enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, and while there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, having a Flagship protocol like Aave would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while fulfilling Aave’s multichain expansion. As well, there are many benefits Aave users and the DAO at large would benefit from.
Metis’ commitment to a decentralized future is built into its very structure, including the ethos of creating a sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem where its partners are set up to thrive. This is best exemplified by Metis’ Builder Mining Program. This program allows all DApps deployed on Andromeda to directly participate in the revenue Metis generates. For example: if Aave deployed on Andromeda, 30% of the fees accrued from every single transaction occurring through Aave would be kicked back directly back to Aave, in perpetuity.
The mission at Metis is to provide the infrastructure and incentive system to make deployment on our network a no-brainer. This additional revenue will be going to the Aave DAO’s treasury and as such, will be able to be utilized as seen fit by the Aave community at large.
Metis also has some of the fastest transactions in blockchain, often executing faster than your web browser can process them, and always executing faster than MetaMask can record them. Transactions on our Layer 2 network currently cost about $2-$3, considerably less than the gas fees on Layer 1 Ethereum. Metis will launch its own storage layer by the end of Q1 2022, which will enable cheap, secure storage of NFTs and other large blocks of data, while doubling as an additional scalability layer; as a result, transaction fees will drop to just cents by the end of Q1 2022.
The traction earned by our popular DeFi protocols are great case studies to the adoption and eagerness of the Metis community to engage with our DeFi ecosystem. Netswap, the first ever native Layer 2 DEX, surpassed $1B in trading volume in its first month of operation. Likewise, popular yield optimization protocols Beefy Finance and Pickle Finance have achieved great success since integrating and launching their protocols on Andromeda.
Metis is open and willing to work with Aave to determine the optimal strategy for liquidity incentivization, marketing and awareness campaigns, and additional benefits to bring to its users. We are considering the options of qualifying airdrops for interaction with the protocol on Andromeda and building Reputation Power (allowing for future whitelisting opportunities) for Aave holders voting on this proposal. We will also offer Aave the opportunity to set up a Verifier node for the Metis Layer 2 network, providing a steady stream of income to the Aave DAO in perpetuity and aligning incentives for the future decentralization and wellbeing of the Metis network.
Metis is ready to onboard Aave to its ecosystem and looks forward to the opportunity to build a long-term, sustainable, and mutually-beneficial relationship.

Title: [ARFC] Receipt of Gauntlet Insolvency Fund
Author: @llamaxyz
Dated: 2022-11-06

---


# Simple Summary

Llama proposes that Gauntlet's Insolvency Fund be transferred to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve in the form of AAVE tokens.

# Abstract

In response to excessive CRV debt, Gauntlet is to transfer the funds held in the Insolvency Fund to Aave. Llama proposes that the Insolvency Fund be transferred in the form of AAVE tokens to the Ecosystem Reserve. 

stkAAVE is to be unstaked and the resulting AAVE transferred to the following address: `ethereum: 0x25F2226B597E8F9514B3F68F00f494cF4f286491` 

# Motivation

Gauntlet has already committed to transferring the Insolvency Funds to Aave as mentioned on this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-repay-excess-debt-in-crv-market-for-aave-v2-eth/10779). This proposal is to formalize that Aave is to receive AAVE tokens and that they are to be received into the Ecosystem Reserve.

Llama proposes that the AAVE tokens from the Insolvency Fund are not used to purchase the CRV needed to repay the excessive debt in the CRV Reserve. Acquiring the required CRV is to be funded in an alternative manner. A separate proposal will emerge providing a place for conversation around how to proceed with repaying the bad debt within the CRV Reserve.

# Specification

Gauntlet is to perform the following:

* Unstakes the stkAAVE holding
* Upon the cooldown period ending, retrieves the AAVE
* Transfers AAVE to the Ecosystem Reserve

Ecosystem Reserve: `ethereum: 0x25F2226B597E8F9514B3F68F00f494cF4f286491` 

# Next Steps

* Snapshot is to be posted on the 11th December
* Voting starts 12th December 
* Voting finishes 16th December
* Short Executor voting criteria to be applied

206,"We [Blockchain at Michigan](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal for initiating Uniswap v3 deployment on the Avalanche blockchain. With the BSL expiring on April 1st, the Uniswap Foundation has [stated](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-deployment-guide/19988?u=gfxlabs) the importance of Uniswap v3 expansion to popular EVM chains. Establishing Uniswap on alt L1s–and not just on Ethereum L2s–is vital for establishing a robust, multichain future. After consulting with the Ava Labs team, we believe that this is a crucial and opportune time for Uniswap to expand to Avalanche’s growing ecosystem.

## Proposal Motivation

The primary urgency behind this proposal is the upcoming BSL expiration on April 1st. As soon as the license expires, all entities will have the legal right to duplicate Uniswap v3 and utilize the forked code for commercial purposes. Invariably, large chains like Avalanche will see a rapid influx of v3 copycats, which will dilute the markets on those respective chains. It is therefore imperative for Uniswap v3 to get ahead of the competitors by launching on large chains before duplicates arise. Trader Joe v2, the current leading DEX on Avalanche, did [$92.45M](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/avalanche) of volume in the past 24 hours (Feb 23)–indicative of the demand for a concentrated liquidity AMM. Due to the continual growth of the Avalanche ecosystem, along with the liquidity present on the platform, we believe that this proposal be enacted as soon as possible to ensure that Uniswap establishes a foothold in the Avalanche DEX market.

We realize that beyond the chain of deployment, the community must also consider the required cross-chain messaging protocol. Although the DAO previously coalesced to utilize [Wormhole for the BNB Chain deployment](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x6b8df360fdf73085b21fdf5eef9f85916fbde95621a3d454cb20fbe545ffc852), we believe that such a decision should not set a precedent for bridge selection. A vendor lock-in model would prevent the further testing of equally renowned messaging protocols like LayerZero. A handful of delegates and tokenholders have also pioneered a more novel approach to governance messaging, where cross-chain governance relies not on a single bridge but simultaneously on a handful of bridges. Although we see the merits of a [multi-bridge system](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148/1), it will take time for this approach to garner attention and be fully vetted. The DAO can decide to opt into a multi bridge system in the future–but for an agile deployment that can be implemented in the present, we believe that LayerZero is the best solution.

## Current State of Avalanche
Avalanche is a blockchain platform that utilizes three separate blockchains, the Platform Chain (P-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), and Exchange Chain (X-Chain), to improve scalability and interoperability. These three chains compose a consortium of validators called the Primary Network, which is responsible for Avalanche’s security.

Avalanche operates with the Avalanche consensus algorithm, which is designed to be more efficient than alternative consensus mechanisms and enables EVM-compatibility. The consensus mechanism checks validators’ transaction confirmations randomly by allowing all nodes to work in parallel, increasing the probability that a transaction is valid. The C-Chain leverages the Snowman consensus protocol, which mimics Avalanche consensus but is optimized for smart contract integration. Therefore, most Avalanche dAPP activity currently transpires on the C-chain. 

In comparison to other smart contract platforms, Avalanche touts 2-second time-to-finality, faster than any of its peers (ex. Ethereum finality is 10 minutes). Uniswap on Avalanche would thereby enhance the user experience for both application users and liquidity providers. 

Avalanche also allows for an unbounded number of validators without sacrificing block time. This allows for an increasing degree of decentralization over time. In Q4 2022, the platform’s [Nakamoto coefficient increased from 30 to 32](https://nakaflow.io/)–surpassing most other L1s–and is poised to continue in an upward direction. Currently, there are [1,228 validators](https://www.avax.network/validators) and over [233M AVAX tokens staked](https://www.avax.network/validators). The expanding validator set and staked AVAX tokens exemplify a robust L1.

The Avalanche architecture permits a high degree of scalability through its ecosystem of subnets. Similar to Ethereum’s L2s, subnets allow for outsourcing blockspace from the Primary Network to alternative blockchains. Application-specific blockchains can be launched under customized subnets, granting builders control over their development stack (subnets specify their own execution logic, fee regime, state, networking, and security). Large protocols that initially relied on the C-Chain, like DFK and StepNetwork, are now migrating to their individualized subnets. The increase in subnets furthers the security of Avalanche since each subnet’s validators must simultaneously secure the Primary Network.

Increased application activity on the C-Chain and subnets presents Avalanche as an expanding ecosystem. At the time of writing, according to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/chains), Avalanche holds over $950M of TVL across 281 different protocols.

Since launching in Q3 2020, Avalanche’s txn count has cumulatively increased to nearly [700M](https://avascan.info/). Messari reported that between Nov 2021 - Nov 2022 alone, the network experienced [YoY txn growth of 1,507%](https://research.nansen.ai/article/529/avalanche-scaling-with-subnets). Although [daily active users remained relatively steady since Summer 2022](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/avalanche), average daily transactions increased from ~1M to ~3M, indicating the emergence of power users. A reliable user base is imperative for a properly functioning Uniswap protocol. The presence of long-term liquidity provision would aid in bootstrapping individual subnets as well as making the C-Chain more robust.

Post deployment, the most fierce competitor for Uni v3 will be Trader Joe. Since Trader Joe recently released a Uni v3-like, [capital efficient AMM](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/), Uniswap has an incentive to capture as much of Avalanche’s DEX market prior to Trader Joe v2 locking in a concrete user base. Plus, after the BSL expires in April, numerous Uni v3 forks will invariably launch on Avalanche. Therefore, to minimize Uniswap’s dilution in the Avalanche ecosystem, the DAO is incentivized to launch v3 as soon as possible.

Due to Uniswap’s strong brand, it has the ability to capture market share from existing DEXs and attract liquidity from new users. A notable historical anecdote is Polygon. Once Uni v3 launched on Polygon, it quickly acquired market share from both Quickswap and Sushiswap. Although this experiment is yet to be tested on an alt L1, it is likely that a similar pattern will surface on Avalanche–although Trader Joe may present a higher degree of friction. Nonetheless, it is not necessary that the DEX competition will result in a zero-sum game and can favor both Trader Joe and Uniswap simultaneously. 

Apart from DeFi developments, Avalanche has also made strides in other sectors like gaming, NFTs, and user adoption. Further facilitation of each of these categories is enabled by a DEX like Uniswap. And in turn, Uniswap liquidity providers–and maybe token holders–will attain economic value from the protocol’s increased usage. 

## Safety and Cross-Chain Governance

### LayerZero Overview
We propose using LayerZero, an omnichain bridging solution, to facilitate cross-chain message passing between Ethereum and Avalanche. LayerZero has pre-existing support for both Avalanche and Ethereum.

The [first use case of Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) transfer](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/layerzero-aims-to-create-one-unified-experience-for-btc-b-339eb4d23672) has been active for nearly 4 months on Avalanche. LayerZero allows Avalanche BTC (BTC.b) bridging between all LayerZero-supported chains, creating a composable, unified liquidity system for BTC. From the 25+ supported chains, two, DFK and Swimmer, are run as their own subnets. Apart from cross-chain asset transferring, LayerZero also supports arbitrary message passing–which includes governance communication between Uniswap on Ethereum to Avalanche.

LayerZero is backed by the likes of a16z, Sequoia, Uniswap Labs, Coinbase, and numerous others–it is supported by thousands of cross-chain builders with over 2,000 contracts deployed on mainnet, ~700 unique applications, ~2M total messages, ~$5B transactional volume, and billions of dollars in TVL.

**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**

LayerZero endpoints rely on an architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and two off-chain entities called oracles and relayers to securely relay messages between endpoints on a source and destination chain. The oracle is responsible for relaying block headers, and with the default LayerZero setup, will be handled by Chainlink. A transaction proof is sent using the relayer; the default relayer is operated by LayerZero. Hence, the security of the system relies on 2 entities. The primary assumption behind this setup is that the oracle and relayer remain independent at all times. Collusion between the entities would lead to a compromised system. Uniswap will have the option to operate one or both of these entities which would decrease the possibility of collusion.

**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**

LayerZero leverages direct MPT validation construction of the source transaction and verifies the merkle inclusion proof directly on the destination chain via the protocol’s novel Ultra Light Node (ULN).

**Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?**

Malicious message transmission is a possibility if there is a compromise of both the oracle and relayer sets. Both entities would have to agree to approve a fraudulent message together and against the same application. For example, the decentralized Chainlink DON would have to actively collude with the LayerZero Labs relayer at the same time to enable passing of a malicious message. If the application selects multiple oracles and multiple relayers, thereby pricing its security higher, fraudulent message passing would require more independent parties to be simultaneously compromised.

**What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?**

Unlike some other bridges, LayerZero does not pose an economic stake or bond to punish malicious actors via a slashing mechanism. Instead, if the default oracle-relayer configuration is compromised, then there is a reputational backlash that would beset LayerZero and Chainlink–since they are the entities responsible for the relayer and oracle, respectively. However, if Uniswap decides to control the messaging stack by running either the oracle or relayer, then Uniswap itself will have to answer for its shortcomings if there happens to be malicious activity.

LayerZero is also designed to be censorship resistant. Oracles and Relayers cannot censor messages without censoring all messages due to the sequential nonce ordered enforcement on the receiving chain. As a result, if an attacker obtained control of the Uniswap-selected Oracles or Relayers, and succeeded in censoring a message, every subsequent message would also be censored and the vote would stop. Uniswap could then expediently resolve the issue by updating configurations and messaging would resume.

**Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?**

Immutability is part and parcel to LayerZero’s infrastructure. Its smart contracts are not upgradable and therefore aren’t prone to bugs due to smart contract updates. Smart contract bugs is the predominant historical cause for bridge exploits, as was the case with Wormhole’s $300M and Nomad’s $190M hack in 2022. To ensure that the current LayerZero contracts are reliable enough to be set in stone and entirely independent from LayerZero Labs’ future involvements, the protocol has been [audited 35+ times](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/Audits) and reviewed at least 3+ times by the LayerZero Labs team.

LayerZero is the only major cross-chain messaging protocol to have secured significant transaction volume (~$5B) over time without any exploit, compromise of key infrastructure, or loss of user funds. Additionally, LayerZero has the [largest live bug bounty across the industry at up to $15M](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-security-update-april-2022-4c27a22380b4).

### Future Bridge Alterations
Following deployment, if Uniswap governance would like to switch to a different bridge setup, the DAO can do so with a future proposal. There are current ruminations regarding a multi bridge messaging setup–but that is too early to implement for this proposal. Much like the recent BNB Chain deployment proposal, we recommend utilizing a single bridge for the time being and integrating a more novel system later on after the BSL expiration. 

## License Exemption
We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow LayerZero to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Avalanche, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap v3 will be deployed on Avalanche by LayerZero Labs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)”. LayerZero Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.

## Timeline
Once the on-chain governance proposal is completed, LayerZero Labs will deploy the Uniswap v3 smart contracts on the Avalanche C-Chain. Uniswap Labs will handle the front-end integration updates and include Avalanche to the auto router. Altogether, this deployment will take ~5 weeks to complete.",neutral

211,"[ARFC] MaticX Supply Cap Increase in Polygon V3

Author: Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)

Date: 2024-01-30

# **Summary**

This proposal aims to increase the MaticX Supply Cap on Polygon V3 to match market demand.

# **Motivation**

Increasing the supply cap of Polygon MaticX in the Aave market is a strategic move to accommodate growing demand, and follow a previous DAO decision to maintain aggressive supply caps for correlated assets. 

Deposits of MaticX have been over 95% of the supply cap for some time. Increasing the Supply Cap will enable users to continue depositing MaticX and enter the recursive MaticX/wMATIC yield strategy. 

The DAO has previously voted to allow assets with correlated borrow supply caps to be up to 75% of cumulative supply. Since this exceeds the supply cap increase allowable by risk stewards, this proposal will increase supply caps through the typical ARFC process. Current circulating supply is over 100M, so this proposal will increase the supply cap to 75M.

# **Specification**

Increase the supply cap for MaticX on Polygon V3 to the following. 

| Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SupplyCap | 62M | 75M |

title: [ARFC] LDO Emission_Admin for Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism v3 Liquidity Pools
Author: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting
Dated: 2023-01-26

---

# Summary

This proposal is to enable Lido to distribute LDO rewards across the Aave v3 Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism Liquidity Pools. The `Emission_Admin` role for LDO on each network is to be assigned to a wallet controlled by the Lido DAO.

# Abstract

Lido seeks to distribute LDO rewards across to the various Aave v3 deployments. To achieve this, the `EmissionManager` function assigns an owner to the `Emission_Admin` role for LDO on each respective Aave v3 deployment, [1,2].

The wallet with `Emission Admin` permission for LDO on each aave v3 deployment then controls the distribution of only LDO rewards across the respective Liquidity Pool.

# Motivation

Enable Lido DAO to distribute LDO rewards across the Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism v3 Liquidity Pools.

The Lido Liquidity Mining Committee (LMC) determines the emission rate and duration at which LDO rewards are offered.

Typically, the LMC meets and determines the next 30 days of LDO rewards on a rolling basis. This means each month, the committee will determine if to extend the LDO rewards, or change the amount of LDO being offered across the various Aave v3 Liquidity Pools.

# Specification

The `EmissionManager`, a governance controlled function, assigns the `Emission_Admin` role for a specified token, LDO.

The `Emission_Admin` role controls the distribution of the specified token, LDO, across the specified Aave deployments.

The `Emission_Admin` can distribute LDO anywhere across the Aave v3 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.

# Implementation

Set `Emission_Admin` permission for LDO to the following Lido address:

|Network|LDO Address|Emission Admin|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Ethereum|0x5A98FcBEA516Cf06857215779Fd812CA3beF1B32|0x87D93d9B2C672bf9c9642d853a8682546a5012B5|

Title: [ARFC] Merit - A New Aave-Alignment User Reward System
Author: Marc Zeller - Aave Chan Initiative
Dated: 2024-02-16
---

## Summary
""Merit"" proposes a merkle-tree-based periodic airdrop system, designed to reward Aave-aligned user behaviors and enhance protocol competitiveness, with a defined budget for the initial 90-day period.

## Motivation
Addressing the competitive DeFi landscape, ""Merit"" seeks to elevate Aave's appeal and efficiency through a rewarding mechanism that prioritizes DAO-beneficial actions, distinguishing Aave from competitors employing artificial incentive methods.

## Specification

The ""Merit"" system employs a booster-based model to reward specific user actions with points, dictating the weekly StkAAVE and GHO distribution. The system incorporates merit boosters and diluters to adjust user rewards based on their alignment with Aave's objectives. The initiative starts with a budget of 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO, totaling 5M$ for a 90-day duration, focusing on direct Aave protocol engagement and promoting diversified staking strategies.

### Rewarded Actions

Actions that align with Aave's strategic objectives will be rewarded:

| Action |
| --- |
| Borrow wETH |
| Borrow GHO |

### Merit boosters

Merit boosters enhance these rewards for specific behaviors:

| Behavior | Multiplier description |
| --- | --- |
| Second-degree user of aligned protocol | booster for users coming from aligned protocols that favor Aave over other protocols. |
| Migrator | Incentive for moving positions to Aave from others protocols |
| Diversity Supporter | Rewards for using minority LSTs |
| Aavenger | usage of AAVE as collateral
| MakerDAO fren | usage of sDAI as collateral
| OG DAO Participant | Booster for early DAO voters or delegates |
| Holdooor | Booster for ≥100-day AAVE holders in the past year |
| Stakoor | Booster for ≥100-day StkAAVE holders in the past year |
| Staker | Bonus for staking AAVE, StkBPT, StkGHO |
| Active in Governance | Rewards for voting or delegating to an Aave DAO recognized delegate platform |

### Merit Diluters

Merit Diluters will dilute part or all rewards for certain behaviors:

| Behavior | Dilution Description/Effect |
| --- | --- |
| User of Non-Aligned Protocol | Severe dilution (up to -100%) |

### Non-aligned protocol list:

We propose to launch Merit with a single protocol with non-aligned status: **Morpho Aave Optimizers V2 & V3**

### Migration bonus multipliers list:

We propose to apply the “migratooor” Boosters to users leaving the following protocols to join the Aave ecosystem:

- Morpho V2
- Morpho V3
- Morpho Blue
- Spark


### Budget and Scope

- **Bi-Weekly Budget:** Defined by Aave Finance service providers, all data will be published publicly after the Merit program ends.
- **Total Budget:** **5M$ with 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO for 90 days.**
- **Scope:** Aave V3 Ethereum.

### Synergies

Numerous protocols reached out during the TEMP CHECK period to co-incentive merit; @karpatkey_TokenLogic via Aave Finance are coordinating these efforts, and their incentives are expected to be on top of the Merit budget.

## Next Steps

1. Refine the proposal details based on community feedback to achieve consensus.
2. Conduct a snapshot vote for community sentiment.
3. Following a successful snapshot outcome, escalate to the AIP stage for official voting and implementation.

**Title:** [ARFC] Onboarding of weETH to Aave v3 on Ethereum
**Author:** Ether.fi & ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-02-27

---
### **Summary:**

The current ARFC seeks to add [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) Liquid Restaking Token weETH to Aave V3 Ethereum, after the successful [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboarding-weeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/16546) and [TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xffe122a2fb0b34e713b7bb8e74e943b35c6cb298bafc4e50c464b62167e3246e).

The intention behind this initiative is to enhance the diversity of assets on Aave and bolster liquidity within the ecosystem.

### Motivation:

eETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer. As of February 3rd, approximately 290,310 ETH ($670M) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi 1](http://ether.fi/) protocol, and XX has been natively restaked in EigenLayer.

[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) stands as the pioneering decentralized and non-custodial delegated staking protocol featuring an LRT (eETH). A notable feature of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is the control it provides stakers over their keys. The team behind the protocol is guided by the following principles:

1. Decentralization is the foremost objective. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is unwavering in its commitment to maintain the protocol's non-custodial and decentralized nature, ensuring that stakers always have control over their ETH.
2. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) operates as a legitimate business with a sustainable revenue model, with the team dedicated to its long-term success. There is no place for deceptive or unsustainable financial practices.
3. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is committed to always acting in the best interest of the Ethereum community. In the event of any missteps, the team at [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) will take responsibility and swiftly rectify the situation.

Risks:

[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)’s LRT eETH is 100% redeemable. Users who deposit ETH into the protocol can withdraw their stake at any time. The holdings are publicly auditable on-chain and the protocol retains healthy reserves to offset any losses.

## Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:

Anyone who deposits weETH into Aave will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)  and EigenLayer points to be used for future incentives.

Users are given eETH on a 1:1 basis with a minimum deposit of 0.001 ETH. 

[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity (weETH) to various platforms.

Title: [ARFC] Polygon v2 Borrow Rate Adjustments
Author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic & @ChaosLabs 
Created: 2024-04-04

---

# Summary

This publication proposes gradually revising the Borrow Rate on Polygon v2 to provide further encouragement for users to migrate to Aave v3.

# Motivation

Over the last [8 months](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/284/) the Reserve Factor (RF) on Polygon v2 has gradually increased from as low as 21.00% to 99.99%. As a result, deposit yield converged to zero and the capital efficiency of Aave v2 has been reduced on Polygon.

With the RF now approaching the maximum across all reserves, this publication seek to gradually increase the cost of capital via periodic borrow rate adjustments, every two weeks in a predictable fashion.

Based upon recent borrow rates behaviour, the market has demonstrated the ability to withstand periods of elevated borrowing rates. 

## Non Frozen Assets

For non-frozen assets, this proposal recommends increasing the Slope1 parameter by 75bps every two weeks, or 1.5% per month, to encourage further migration of users from v2 to v3. The outcome of this [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe2dd228640c3cad93f5418c40c4b5743b3c6c85aa0aae9eee53cbdbca2ed5c2d) has been taken into consideration when drafting the current IR parameters included in this proposal.

The Slope2 parameter is to be revised to discourage utilisation exceeding the Uoptimal value. Note, several reserves are experiencing utilisation marginally exceeding Uoptimal. 

As utilisation of each reserve decreases over time, the Uoptimal will be periodically lowered to discourage new debt positions emerging. Any proposed changes to the Uoptimal parameter will be presented via a separate ARFC. 

Upon implementation, this change will not trigger liquidation of any users funds and will gradually increase the cost for users who remain on v2. Please note, there is a Migration Tool that was developed by BGD to aid users migrating from v2 to v3. 

Assets in scope: DAI, MATIC, wBTC, wETH, USDC and USDT.

## Frozen Assets

Each frozen reserve contains a small portion of funds with a very minimal amount of debt. For these assets we recommend a more aggressive implementation: reduce the Uoptimal to 10.00%, revise Slope1 to 50.00% and Slope2 to 500.00% - with  the exception of BAL, which receives a Uoptimal of 20% due to current utilisation being around 15%.

Assets in scope: BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK and SUSHI.

# Specification

The following parameters are to be updated as follows:

| Asset | Current Slope1 | Proposed Slope1 | Current Uoptimal | Proposed Uoptimal | Current Slope2 | Proposed Slope2 |
| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---:  |   :---:   |
| BAL   | 27.00% | 50.00% | 65.00% | 20.00% | 236.00% | 500.00% |
| CRV   | 17.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 392.00% | 500.00% |
| DAI   | 12.00% | 12.75% | 71.00% | 71.00% | 105.00% |   200.00% |
| GHST  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 23.00% | 10.00% | 413.00% | 500.00% |
| LINK  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 402.00% | 500.00% |
| USDT  | 12.00% | 12.75% | 52.00% | 52.00% | 236.00% |   236.00% |
| wBTC  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 37.00% | 37.00% | 536.00% |   536.00% |
| wETH  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 40.00% | 40.00% | 167.00% |   200.00% |
| wMATIC|  6.00% |  6.75% | 48.00% | 48.00% | 440.00% |   500.00% |
| wUSDC | 12.00% | 12.75% | 77.00% | 77.00% | 134.00% |   200.00% |

Subject to approval from @ChaosLabs, a subsequent proposal will be submitted every two weeks.

Title: [ARFC] Reduce Reserve Factor on wstETH 
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-24

---

# **Summary**
For further alignment with the upcoming Lido Alliance proposals, this proposal will reduce the reserve factor for wstETH to 5%. 

## **Motivation**

Aave and Lido have historically seen symbiotic growth, with stETH being one of the premier collaterals on Aave and leveraged staking being one of the most profitable use cases for both Aave DAO and Lido users.

As part of the recently passed [TEMP CHECK proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-deploy-a-lido-aave-v3-instance/17930) to create an isolated instance for wstETH borrowers, a number of other parameter changes were proposed to align Lido and Aave. 

This proposal implements the agreed reserve factor change for wstETH to 5%.

## **Specification**

On all networks, change wstETH Reserve Factor to 5%. 

## Disclaimer

The ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.

## Next Steps

1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.

219,"Title: [TEMP CHECK] Allocation of 300k OP Received by Aave Grants DAO

Author: @0xbilll  [Aave Grants DAO]

Created: 2023-04-19

---

###  **Simple Summary**

This proposal is for the community’s approval as to how Aave Grants DAO (AGD) should allocate the 300,000 OP tokens received as part of OP Stimpack phase 0. We are proposing allocating up to 100,000 OP as part of the current AGD proposal and keeping the remaining 200,000 OP in the AGD multisig for future seasons of AGD.

### **Background**

Last year, [we created a proposal and successfully received 300,000 OP tokens](https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-aave/1712?u=bill) as part of phase 0 of OP Stimpack. The tokens are to go towards funding projects to help grow Aave on Optimism. The original post in the Optimism forum states:

![Aave Grants.png](ipfs://bafkreiad63ih6ihr6tbkiplsr6fbvs3jmwjy4cdptah657fdbcnfga2jia)

AGD has funded multiple projects building on Optimism with funds received from Aave DAO. These include:

● Analytics from[ DappLooker](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v3-user-retention-dashboards-and-analytics/10946),[ Block Analitica](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/markets/) &[ Projection Finance](https://www.projection.finance/)

● Integrations with[ Mean Finance](https://mean.finance/create/10),[ Layer3](https://beta.layer3.xyz/communities/aave) &[ DeFunds](https://defunds.co/)

● Native apps like[ Pegasus Finance](https://twitter.com/0xPegasusFi),[ Lyra Finance](https://twitter.com/lyrafinance) &[ Cetra Finance](https://cetra.finance/)

This proposal seeks to clarify and gain community support as to how the OP received should be allocated.

### **Proposed Allocation**

The proposal recommends allocating up to 100k OP to be used in the same timeline as [the current AGD engagement](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-aave-grants-dao-renewal/11289?u=0xbilll) and keeping the remaining 200k OP in the AGD multisig for use in future quarters of AGD. We are thankful to Optimism for receiving these funds. We want to exercise diligence in allocating them and believe that at current market prices, the original amount received can support several quarters of AGD. Separating these amounts will ensure long-term support for teams building in the Aave Optimism ecosystem.

For the 100k OP to distribute under the current AGD engagement, we propose a breakdown of funds similar to what was outlined in the original post on the Optimism forum: 2/3rds to grants and 1/3rd to events.

1. Optimism focused grants: up to 2/3rds

* For the grants portion, the OP will be distributed to grant recipients focused on growing Aave on Optimism. Going forward, and aligned with our current proposal, we will place a larger focus on funding projects related to growing GHO on Optimism. To help attract builders and grow awareness, we will push a wider marketing effort about the campaign.

2. Optimism focused events & bounties: up to 1/3rd

* The main area this will go to is sponsoring bounties and prizes at hackathons for teams building to support or grow the Aave Optimism ecosystem.

* These bounties will be in addition to the bounties AGD is already planning to offer at hackathons. Since AGD is already sponsoring these events, all of the sponsorship fees and other overhead costs that would be required are already covered, making this an effective way to put the OP to use.

Any unused funds will remain in the treasury and can be allocated in future AGD proposals. Updates on OP spent will be included periodically in[ AGD’s monthly forum updates](https://governance.aave.com/t/agd-renewal-4-recent-work-updates/11585?u=0xbilll).

### **Next Steps**

*Temperature Check:* Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal.

*Snapshot:* If positive, AGD will proceed with the allocation of funds as described above. No AIP or further governance action is required.",neutral

222,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust six (6) total risk parameters including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. In addition, Gauntlet recommends freezing legacy KNC. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.

## Specification


Our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. 

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| DAI Loan To Value     | 75%     | 77%     |
| LINK Liquidation Bonus     | 6.5%     | 6.3%     |
| LINK Liquidation Threshold    | 75%     | 78%     |
| USDC Loan To Value    | 82.5%     | 85.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Bonus    | 4.0%     | 4.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Threshold    | 85%     | 86%     |



See below volatility and exchange volume data from 03/17 to 03/31. These are useful metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations.

## Freezing Legacy KNC

The KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20/2021, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 3/28/2022, roughly 195M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdefa4e8a7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 57M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There are currently $2.9M KNCL supplied and $900K total borrowed on Aave v2.

Considering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.

223,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust eleven (11) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. As a heads up, Gauntlet will publish a blog post soon on our parameter recommendation methodology to provide more context to the community

Our parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Our parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Our simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. Our individual collateral pages on the [dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding other interesting inputs and outputs related to our simulations. For more information, please refer to our [Aave market risk assessment](https://gauntlet.network/reports/aave) where we provide a tactical understanding of our model architecture. 

## Specification

These past two weeks saw slight decreases in volatility and increases in liquidity and trading volume, which our simulations picked up on. In addition, our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-downturn-gauntlet-risk-review-jan-2022/7190) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels.

224,"Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on Base

Author: @fig - Flipside Crypto

Date: 2023-05-22

---

## Simple Summary

This Temperature Check seeks the community's input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Base mainnet, expanding Aave to a unique, OP-stack network.

## Background

Base is an open-source, developer-friendly L2 EVM blockchain, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. Base is incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase’s on-chain products and a sandbox for permissionless development.

Coinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launch of Base to help realize the Optimism superchain vision. Base testnet is currently live — and mainnet soon around the corner.

Docs are available at [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/)

Its mission and identity are stated clearly in the docs: ***Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users to web3.***

As a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective’s mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.

Four key principles have shaped Base that will continue to guide its approach:


**Open-source**

Base is built on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase is joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone.




**A bridge, not an island**

Base is optimized for easy, secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, as well as other L1 ecosystems like Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. Builders and users may start on Base, but go everywhere Base is a “bridge” for users into the crypto economy.



**Decentralization** 

 Decentralization is essential for the crypto economy ""to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone.” Coinbase is deeply committed to progressing toward full decentralization over the years ahead.


**For everyone**

Base is a vision to be an open ecosystem, seeded with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life.

 
Base has launched with a diverse array of launch partners, servicing different developer and user needs across data, block explorers, bridging, custody, DeFi, and others.

Please see the list below of robust launch partners:

 
![dd6a532ab00053c11ed6070d651915f493105e81_2_1380x712.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihs7se4xncwxlk4lrb3t4lkcsx2o2gkjqj6pt6rxplamuho5b2znm)
    

## Motivation

The Aave community has voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase across other prominent L2s such as Arbiturm, Metis, and Optimism.

By enabling Base on Aave, it creates valuable (and differentiated) revenue opportunities for Aave, capturing the growth and interest of users who live on the Coinbase platform.

Base is a way for Aave to instantly leverage Coinbase’s products and distribution: seamless Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to **110mm+** users and **$80B+** assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.

In the first week of Base, 18k developers deployed 55k smart contracts on testnet. This activity sustained through the network's announcement has the potential to introduce new, valuable users to DeFi and Aave.

Since Base's testnet launch on 02/23/2023, metrics illustrate strong activity:

* 2,000,000 accounts created
* 17,000,000 transactions
* 1,000,000+ addresses holding a Base Builder NFT for participating in in Quests

In addition, Base has shown impressive retention for a blockchain, with ~70,000 unique wallets returning to Base for subsequent transactions within one day. The users, likely early developers, paint a promising outlook for the activity that may be seen on mainnet.

## Specification

This *TEMP CHECK* presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Base mainnet on day one of its launch.

Suggested risk parameters for this asset are provided in the table below.

Flipside Crypto invites risk service providers (@Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of the token.

## Disclaimer

The information provided above about Base is from public sources and Flipside Crypto cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.

For full disclosure, Coinbase partnered with Flipside Crypto upon the announcement of the network to make Base on-chain data available for free for analysts.

Coinbase has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and we are doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.

As a cautionary measure to prevent an appearance of a conflict of interest, Flipside will abstain from voting on this proposal - in line with other proposals we put forward.

This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.

## Next Steps

**Temperature Check:** Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Base Mainnet.

**ARFC:** If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.

**AIP:** If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.

## Aave Arc (Fireblocks) Parameter Changes Specification

Our simulation platform indicates that increasing the capital efficiency of USDC collateral does not meaningfully increase the risk of insolvencies. Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| USDC Loan To Value     | 85.5%     | 87.5%     |
| USDC Liquidation Threshold     | 88%     | 90%     |

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Launch Aave V3 on Kava EVM 

Author: [Various Kava Ecosystem Contributors]

Created: 2023-12-12

---

# Summary

KAVA in collaboration with PGov and Michigan Blockchain propose the integration of Aave V3 with KAVA. KAVA’s EVM compatibility and integration will be a crucial advancement for the Aave multichain vision. The integration will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Cosmos and enables Cosmos ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through KAVA

# Motivation

This proposal aims to be a starting point in the process of bringing Aave to the KAVA Ecosystem and aims to provide necessary details to the Aave community to consider the merits of KAVA integration. Kava has been building out the cornerstones of a solid DeFi ecosystem since mainnet launch in 2022. The key dexes in the ecosystem are Kinetix (a Uniswap v3 dex plus perpetual trading platform built by the Quickswap team from Polygon), WAGMI (protocol owned liquidity dex), and Equilibre (a ve3,3 dex). There are a few burgeoning lending protocols on the chain, but with the team’s plans to deprecate the existing leading lending protocol on the Cosmos SDK side, Kava Lend, there exists an incredible opportunity for a blue chip lending protocol like Aave to establish market dominance on the EVM side.

In addition to the market opportunity, the Kava ecosystem has an ongoing incentive program called the Kava Rise program which incentivizes protocol usage pro-rata based on TVL per protocol. Currently 1M Kava is being distributed per month to protocols pro-rata. Due to the proclivity for lending protocols to attract a significant portion of TVL in an ecosystem, Aave stands to earn the majority of these rewards. The current distribution of rewards is 1M Kava per month, and can increase pending governance approval as the ecosystem matures.

The Kava Foundation has committed to providing liquidity mining rewards of a minimum of 1M Kava guaranteed over the first year for the Aave community.

*Benefits of deploying on Kava*

With the KAVA integration, Aave gets additional markets with Market Cap of $740M, ~200M of locked liquidity, native assets like ATOM, USDT, WBTC and more. KAVA itself is connected well within the Cosmos ecosystem, thus the integration will also enable the cosmos community to plug its deep $60Bn liquidity to Aave through KAVA.

- Kava today is the 12th largest chain by TVL, and 9th by number of deployed protocols as per DefiLlama 2
- Kava is an EVM built on top of the Cosmos SDK, this also facilitates bringing Cosmos assets (like ATOM) natively onto the Protocol, which is not possible on other EVMs. AAVE has the opportunity to connect trading in the Cosmos and Ethereum.
- Kava is the largest of such an EVM chain with native Cosmos integration capabilities.

*Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment*

In addition, Kava has recently garnered a partnership with Tether, as Tether selected Kava to be the native USDT distributor across the Cosmos. In other words, if a user wants an IBC denominated USDT that’s natively issued by Tether, that USDT needs to originate from Kava. In just a few short months, there has been over $150M USDT natively issued on the Kava blockchain.

WETH is also available as an OFT on Kava via Stargate, and WBTC will soon be issued natively on Kava by Bitgo as well. This provides a plethora of native asset markets for Aave on Kava with deep liquidity.

Some other bluechip deployments on Kava include Curve Finance, Beefy Finance, and an upcoming deployment from Yearn Finance as well.

Kava’s latest partnership with Tether, Bitgo, LayerZero and other DApps mentioned above signify its steady commitment to provide a top of the line DeFi ecosystem to users.

One unique benefit of an Aave v3 deployment on Kava is that Aave would be able to open up Cosmos based markets like ATOM natively on the EVM, which is currently not available on any other chain. We believe this opportunity to open up the Cosmos world to Aave presents a significant opportunity for the community.

# Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:

The Kava Foundation has done a good job of managing its treasury in this recent bear market. Currently the treasury stands at ~360M Kava. The Foundation is happy to seed liquidity in initial markets with up to 50M Kava over the first year.

As mentioned previously, the Kava Rise reward program exists to reward protocols pro-rata based on the amount TVL each project has on a monthly basis. With the commitment to seed liquidity, and the market opportunity for Aave to overtake the soon-to-be deprecated existing Kava Lend protocol, Aave has a clear opportunity to establish TVL and market dominance within the Kava ecosystem, and thereby earn a significant portion of existing 1M Kava/month liquidity mining rewards.

In short, not only will Kava Foundation commit to seeding liquidity, but that seeded liquidity will also drive the flywheel of liquidity mining rewards for Aave users on Kava.

Regardless of TVL, at a bare minimum, the Kava Foundation will commit to 1M Kava in liquidity mining rewards over the first year for the Aave community. It is completely up to the Aave community how it wants to use these rewards.

*About Kava Rise Program*

Kava Rise is an on-chain reward program that rewards builders on Kava. Rewards are distributed monthly on a pro-rata basis on the amount of TVL each project has. The current reward distribution is 1M Kava per month. And this amount can change/increase based on governance as the ecosystem continues to mature.

Read more about the Kava Rise program [here](https://www.kava.io/developer-rewards).

232,"**Title:** Aave Treasury Proposal: Onboard with Centrifuge Prime to invest in RWA

**Author:** @Khan 

**Date:** Sep 12, 2023

---

### **Summary**

This proposal brings on Centrifuge as a service provider to the Aave DAO to setup a legal structure to support RWA investments, develop RWA specific management and governance processes, and allocate $1M of the Aave Treasury’s stablecoin holdings to a liquid US T-Bill fund on Centrifuge, as a proof of concept investment.

This is a first step towards a long term effort for Aave to develop and launch an RWA Facilitator that will back GHO with Real World Assets. With this proposal Aave can earn yield on idle stablecoins, establish long-term RWA infrastructure for the protocol, and allow the Aave DAO to begin building internal familiarity and expertise in the RWA industry.

The proposal minimizes upfront cost and completely recoups the initial investment within 6-12mo and starts earning yield for Aave within the first 3mo. It locks up no long term capital and leaves the DAO in full control over the treasury allocation.

The main results of this proposal:
1. Aave will onboard to Centrifuge Prime to establish the legal and technical infrastructure for the Aave protocol to invest in RWAs.
1. Through Prime, the Aave Treasury will allocate $1M of USDC to the Anemoy LTF, a short-duration US treasury bill pool on Centrifuge.

### **Motivation**

Aave has long been a contributor and supporter of RWA initiatives. Since the first announcement of GHO, the Aave community has consistently expressed its interest in expanding into this area. Treasury Management at Aave has historically been focused on strategic crypto assets, ignoring the returns and liquidity available in offchain markets for various reasons.

Today, with roughly 17% of the treasury in stablecoins (~13m USD), the Aave DAO is overlooking the 5% available interest in the risk-free rate of overnight financing of US treasury assets. This can offer $250,000 of recurring revenue a year at just 5m USD of investment. These markets can immediately become some of the highest earning revenue streams for the DAO.

Beyond just economics, this proposal would allow the Aave DAO to establish and begin developing the internal RWA expertise necessary to engage with these markets. Centrifuge Prime is purpose-built for DeFi native organizations, offering the critical services and infrastructure necessary to onboard a diverse portfolio of RWA through a single interface.

Centrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWA on as collateral, and pioneered the first Aave deployment into RWA with the joint development of the RWA Market. Onboarding Aave to Centrifuge Prime for liquid investment strategies is an optimal approach for scaling RWA with the Aave community. It will develop the legal and technical infrastructure necessary to interface with RWAs safely and efficiently, while allowing the Aave community to get comfortable and familiar with the processes and thinking around RWA. This will put Aave in a significantly improved position to be able to leverage RWA collateral for GHO in the long term, either to improve liquidity or develop additional revenue streams.

### **Specification**

#### **Setting up the Aave DAO Legal Conduit**
This proposal instructs Centrifuge to initiate the setup of a legal structure for the benefit of the Aave DAO that will be ratified and deployed by a subsequent Aave token holder vote.

The process for establishing the legal framework is as follows: The Centrifuge contributor team will retain external legal counsel in the Cayman Islands to represent the Aave DAOs interests. The legal structure itself will be established per the previously discussed legal framework developed by Centrifuge. The defining documents and legal agreement team will be created to incorporate specific processes around the DAOs interaction with the foundation company. The results of this work will be presented to the Aave DAO, an analysis from the external counsel will be provided, and the community will have time to process, provide feedback, and otherwise request changes in the legal structure. The structure will only be implemented and executed with DAO approval, likely via Snapshot or other requisite process as requested by the community.

The legal structure will be integrated with DAO governance through a process defined in the legal documents, is capable of investing and holding assets on behalf of the DAO, and ultimately allow the Aave DAO full legal recourse to their investments. The legal counsel, while required under local Cayman law, is retained for the purposes of having an independent legal party to protect Aave’s interest.

The structure defines the actions the foundation can take, such as initiating investments or redemptions. Any action can be made only with approval from the DAO and providing a DAO approved “resolution” to the Foundation entity described above instructing the Foundation to act in accordance with the resolution. The specific details of this process will be developed alongside the Aave community.

This framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar structures 1. There, the same structure is used to support a >$1.2B debt ceiling, with >600m+ actively deployed.

More information on the fund, the legal framework, and the processes described here can be found in the [on going FAQ discussion here.](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)

#### **Initial pilot investment in Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund**

Once the legal structure has been defined and implemented, a specific DAO resolution will be presented to the DAO that instructs the Foundation to perform a 1M investment into the Anemoy LTF and transfers 1M USDC from the DAOs treasury into the Anemoy pool onchain.
Centrifuge will work with Aave to do an initial test investment and then a partial redemption to test out the complete rails.

#### **Scaling beyond the first transaction**

It is best for Aave to deploy into RWAs slowly. This proposal creates an initial deployment into the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund of $1M (pending DAO approval at the time investment). It is up to the community to initiate further investments, but we recommend keeping RWA allocations at a fixed cap of the overall Aave balance sheet until the community is more comfortable.

From there on, further investment and redemption actions are in full control of the Aave DAO. The process can easily be integrated to support portfolio and allocation decisions made through a more formal treasury management process, either manually or programmatically. Centrifuge is committed to supporting these efforts for the duration of this proposal’s stream.

Outside of US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the Aave DAO to allocate into the following asset classes in the future:

| Bucket| Description | Target Return | Liquidity
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Liquid | Lowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds| 5-6% | Daily
| Preservation | Investments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc. | 6-8% | 3-6 months
| Acceleration | Trade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets | 8-20% | 3-24mo |

#### **Summary Process**
In summary, the following process will be executed through this proposal:
1. Acquire Caymans Legal Counsel
1. Conduct initial legal research and analysis alongside counsel, share to forum
1. Post proposed legal documents and legal arrangement to forum, host community call, gather and implement community feedback. Arrangement will include explicit processes for management of the foundation company (i.e. investments and redemptions).
1. DAO approval of legal implementation
1. Foundation company onboards to Anemoy LTF
1. DAO proposal request for 1m of USDC investment into Anemoy LTF


**Estimated Timeline & Project Phases**


| Activity | Description | Est. Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Legal setup | Creation of Foundation Company, passing of DAO resolutions to start deployment into RWAs | 1-2 months
| Initial Deployment | DAO instructs Foundation to deploy $1M into a US Treasuries Fund and transfers $1M in USDC Stablecoins into the Anemoy LTF | 2-3mo
| Scaling up / Ongoing Operation | DAO can vote on increase allocation to Prime and direct investments towards a variety of liquid lower yielding and more longer term investments at any time | After 3mo

#### **Fees**
While there are some legal setup costs that have to be covered by the DAO upfront we limit these as much as possible.

Even at a conservative deployment of just $2M and a portfolio return equal to current US Treasury yields Aave should break-even within the first 6mo and start generating revenue for the DAO thereafter.

The legal work will be useful far beyond this initial proposal and can be the basis on which Aave onboards RWAs into GHO.

**Fees**
| Fee | Amount | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legal Setup | up to 50,000 USDC | To be paid immediately into a Safe controlled by Centrifuge to pay for lawyers and Cayman service providers to set up a Cayman foundation company to the benefit of the Aave DAO, any unused budget will be returned to the Aave treasury.
|Portfolio Fee | 0.35% p.a. on assets in Prime up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M | Paid on an ongoing basis to Centrifuge for maintaining the portfolio
|Aave Reward | 500 stkAave streamed over 2 years into the Centrifuge treasury, starting with the first 1M UDSC Deployment into Centrifuge Prime |To cover costs of resource and facilitation time for the development of the infrastructure and processes. Centrifuge DAO intends for this to create better alignment with strong skin in the game incentives for success.

title: [ARFC] USDT Risk Parameters Update Aave V3 ETH Pool
author: Marc Zeller, Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
date: 2023-06-06
---

## Abstract

This ARFC proposes an update to the risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, enabling it as collateral.

## Motivation

This proposal aims to unlock the potential of USDT as collateral within the Aave ETH V3 pool. By aligning the risk parameters of USDT with those of USDC, we anticipate an increase in borrowing power for users. This change is expected to stimulate borrowing volume on Aave, thereby contributing to the protocol's revenue. The activation of collateral power for USDT is a strategic move towards creating a more dynamic, efficient, and profitable liquidity environment within the Aave ETH V3 pool.

## Specification

The following table outlines the proposed risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, which will replicate the risk parameters of USDC:

| Parameter | Current Value (USDT) | Proposed Value (USDT) | Current Value (USDC) |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| LTV       | 0%                   | 74%                  | 74%                  |
| LT        | 0%                   | 76%                  | 76%                  |
| LB        | 0%                   | 4.5%                 | 4.5%                 |

## Next Steps

- If the ARFC Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) stage for final approval.

236,"title: GHO Facilitator Onboarding Process and Application
author: @oneski22, @khan
description: A process for prospective GHO Facilitators to apply to be onboarded into the GHO deployment operated by the Aave DAO
created: 2023-03-24

# Abstract
This proposal aims to enact a new governance process by which interested parties may apply to the Aave DAO to have addresses be onboarded as GHO Facilitators. The authors propose a process by which interested parties publish an application to the Aave Forum (governance.aave.com 1), after a period of discussion and comment, an offchain vote is taken using Snapshot. Should that temperature check vote be successful, an on-chain vote targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor will formally add the address and its initial cap to the GHO system as a facilitator. This post outlines the process in detail, an addition includes 2 sample applications for each of the facilitators Aave Companies has released publicly, Aave V3 & Flash Minter.

# Motivation
The GHO Stablecoin Protocol will be governed by the Aave DAO, specifically the Aave DAO Short Executor. There are 3 new processes that the Aave DAO will need to implement:
- a process for facilitator onboarding
- a process for adjustment of a facilitator limit
- a process for facilitator offboarding.

This document only intends to address the first of these processes.

# Implementation
The Facilitator onboarding process will begin with a post on the Aave Governance Forum (governance.aave.com 1) conforming to the template below. Next, a 7 day discussion period will commence for the community to ask questions. After the discussion period a snapshot temperature check can be posted on Snapshot. The standard snapshot process with an informal quorum of 320,000 votes is suggested to ensure sufficient community input is received and to keep consistency with existing governance processes. Should the temperature check be successful, another discussion period of 7 days will commence for the community to further refine the proposal. The authors hope that during this second period technical and risk contributors especially provide feedback on the proposed facilitator design, terms of the credit line and the initial GHO limit being requested. Following this second discussion period, an on-chain proposal targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor can then be posted via the Aave DAO Governance contracts to formally on-board the facilitator with its initial GHO limit.

### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard dlcBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum and Arbitrum 
### Author: Aki Balogh & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
###  Date: 2024-06-24

---

### **Simple Summary:**

Proposal to onboard dlcBTC to Aave v3 on the Ethereum and Arbitrum pools.

### **Motivation/Background:**

dlcBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum, enabling Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi protocols while retaining full ownership of their assets. It leverages Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) for secure cross-chain transactions, ensuring trustless and decentralized asset management. dlcBTC is minted by a decentralized set of merchants who lock BTC with themselves (a process we call ""self-wrapping""), ensuring self-custody and reducing central points of failure.

Unlike other bridges, dlcBTC merchants ""self-wrap"" Bitcoin, meaning funds are never sent to an external address, reducing the risk of theft or loss. dlcBTC has a Chainlink proof of reserve feed. See [https://data.chain.link/feeds/arbitrum/mainnet/dlcbtc-por](https://data.chain.link/feeds/arbitrum/mainnet/dlcbtc-por).

**Benefits of listing that token:**

Listing dlcBTC will enable Bitcoin holders to use their assets as collateral within Aave, increasing liquidity and user engagement on the platform. It will attract a broader user base from the Bitcoin community and enhance the diversity of collateral options within Aave. Additionally, it supports DeFi platforms such as Nektar and Swaap, which can generate staking yield using dlcBTC.

**Market Impact:**

Including dlcBTC will positively impact Aave’s liquidity and user adoption, leveraging Bitcoin’s status as the largest digital asset by market cap and its global brand recognition. The secure and decentralized nature of dlcBTC will contribute to the platform’s growth and stability, enhancing security for users and expanding the overall market reach of Aave. While wBTC has seen great success, its reliance on a single custodian introduces significant counterparty risk. dlcBTC addresses this by decentralizing the merchant set, substantially reducing the potential for counterparty failures.

**Chain to be deployed/listed:**

Ethereum, Arbitrum

**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:**

* Use dlcBTC as collateral within Aave, enhancing liquidity options
* Commitments from the federated set of merchants to ensure “self-wrapped” Bitcoin deposits, visible at the https://mint.dlc.link/proof-of-reserve. Merchants in the process of onboarding include Amber Group, IMC, HashKey and Time Research
* Integration into DeFi platforms such as Nektar, Swaap and Archimedes to generate yield using dlcBTC
* As an exclusive offer to Aave users:
  * Earn 6X points when you use dlcBTC as borrow collateral on Aave
  * Earn 8X points when you deposit dlcBTC and mint GHO
  * Note: Health Factor of the position must be between 1.5 and 3 to qualify for this offer

242,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust three (3) total risk parameters including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across two (2) Aave V2 assets. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). 

## Specification


The past two weeks saw slight decreases in volatility. However, there were also decreases in liquidity and trading volume. Our simulations show that increasing borrow parameters across a wide array of assets could introduce significantly more risk in the short term. The below recommendations drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining risk at safe levels.


| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| FEI Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |
| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |


See below volatility and exchange volume data from 02/10 to 02/24. These are useful metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. 

|Symbol| 02-24 Volatility| 02-10 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| DPI    | 0.767483446      | 0.952875317     | -0.185391871      | 4.8907976   |
| FEI    | 0.05450812       | 0.072266895     | -0.017758775      | -41.5184138 |




## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. 

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

244,"##### ABSTRACT
ApeCast, your app with and audio library full of curated X Spaces and ApeCoin-related recordings! Save time by searching for keywords and listening to specific segments. Read summaries of the audio in the language of your choice for quick overviews. This app will help you catch up on spaces, while not having to listen to the whole thing which can sometimes be 3+ hours!

ApeCast will be released for both iOS and Android.

APP FEATURES

Listening Library
This will be a part of the app that will contain spaces and recordings organized by source. This section will also contain searchable transcriptions for each episode and summaries. The summaries will be automatically translated into multiple languages as well. Other features include:
* Background listening
* Toggle marking an episode as listened
* Ability to subscribe to specific sources only
The downloaded audio will be minimally processed and uploaded. The goal here is to serve two types of users. The first archetype is the user who normally listens live but missed it this time. This would provide an organized way to listen in after the fact. The second archetype is the user who doesn’t have time to listen to a 90m+ episode but wants to listen to specific parts where “…” is mentioned. So they use the search feature to scrub the transcript and listen to just that part. We believe this is a powerful use case for listeners of long spaces.

Initially, we intend to support ApeComms spaces, MOCA town halls, and Ape Assembly Meetings. If the community wants us to support more, we are happy to add up to a total of five sources.

![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6a337e397ed65d27696501ff0137967c764c214b.png)

![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/2689dabbc7c0580184844e2e71b1f9a69f20bb8c.png)

All the translations will be done automatically using an AI translation tool. Since most times it’s quite accurate, this should suffice to get the meaning across. The initial set of supported languages will be French, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish.

Creator Portal
Verified creators will have access to a backend that will allow them to upload audio for processing. They can also edit the transcripts and summaries. This will provide them with more control over their product. Where possible we will auto upload the audio.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The ApeCoin DAO is a collection of small communities with lots of overlap. Many different spaces hold discussions on AIPs but it’s difficult to keep up. It’s also annoying to search for a specific space from a previous week and listen. This app will improve ease of access, and create an archive of spaces and their transcripts. Those who don’t have a lot of time to quickly skim through the transcript can read the summary. We believe this will increase the number of people who engage in the ApeCoin ecosystem more regularly.

245,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal aims to expand the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem through the creation of an animated series pilot and three spin-off comic books, featuring characters owned by ApeCoin DAO holders. We envision a gritty, action-packed, and comedic, anime-inspired adaptation of the American Ape comic book series that prominently features ApeCoin as the primary currency of the Metaverse, reaching beyond the echo chamber of “Crypto Twitter” that is primed to be pitched directly to international streamers via our producing team’s existing development, production and distribution pipelines.

#### OVERALL COST

The team is requesting $300,000 USD in $APE to produce the animated series pilot and three (3) spin-off comics, expanding the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem’s lore and raising awareness of the ApeCoin ecosystem through an ongoing mainstream animated television show and secure an international distribution deal for the comic books.

246,"title: [ARFC] Add DeFi Saver to flashBorrowers on Aave V3

Author: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative

Dated: 2023-03-22

Summary
DeFi Saver is a Dapp that allows users to actively manage and take leveraged positions on Aave and other protocols. This proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as part of the FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism liquidity pools.

If this proposal is implemented, all flashLoan fees for DeFi Saver users using Aave would be waived. The Aave-Chan initiative believes that any incurred lost potential revenue will be compensated by the increased competitiveness of the Aave protocol and the increased borrow volume.

Abstract

this proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum & Optimism liquidity pools.

Motivation
DeFi Saver has a long-standing history of synergies with the Aave Protocol, being one of the first third-party integrations of Aave V1 in 2020.

Currently, every flashloan has a 9 bps fee that rewards liquidity providers in Aave. While flashloans were created by Aave, the ecosystem as a whole has replicated this feature, and most protocols do not implement any fees.

The ACI does not support waiving the fees for flashloans in general, as we firmly believe that users’ funds used, even in the context of a single transaction, should be rewarded.

However, some strategic use cases of V3, such as emode, are very fee-sensitive as they mobilize high leverage. Waiving the DeFi Saver flashloan fees is expected to make these strategies more convenient and profitable, leading to increased borrow volume and thus increased Aave DAO revenue.

This proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as a part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum & Optimism liquidity pools.

Implementation
This proposal aims to implement a single AIP, utilizing three similar payloads (one for each network), which will simply call addFlashBorrower() on the ACL_MANAGER contract.

Limitation
This AIP grants permission to whitelist any DeFi Saver contract for all use cases, such as leveraged positions, EMODE, debt and collateral swaps, with one exception: no smart-contract that migrates a position outside of the Aave ecosystem is eligible for whitelisting.

Disclaimer
The Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not associated with or compensated by DeFi Saver for publishing this AFRC.

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Tooling Upgrade
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @defiJesus & @efecarranza
created: 2023-10-23

---

# Summary

The publication suggests that the Aave DAO contracts @TokenLogic to develop various smart contracts aimed at assisting in the management of the DAO's Treasury.

# Motivation

At present, the Aave DAO has a mechanism for bridging funds between Polygon and Ethereum using the [Aave Polygon-Mainnet ERC20Bridge](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-helpers/tree/master/src/bridges) via the shortExecutor. This contract was created by @efecarranza during their tenure at [Llama](https://governance.aave.com/t/update-on-aave-swapper-and-strategic-asset-manager-contracts/14522/3).

To ensure the Aave DAO's financial stability and the ability to transfer assets across different networks through the shortExecutor, it is crucial to establish equivalent contracts for other networks. One such scenario involves moving USDC from Avalanche to Ethereum, effectively extending the DAO's stable coin runway.

This publication recommends the development of the following tooling contracts:

1) Avalanche to Ethereum
2) Optimism to Ethereum
3) Arbitrum to Ethereum

Upon the creation of these contracts, they will become public goods within the Aave ecosystem. This means that anyone will have the capability to draft a payload for transferring the DAO's funds between various networks with minimal effort.

Once the Avalanche to Ethereum bridge contract is completed, TokenLogic intends to propose a fund migration to the Ethereum Treasury to support the ongoing financial stability of the DAO.

# Specification

TokenLogic is to create the following contracts:

1) Avalanche Bridge to Ethereum
2) Arbitrum Bridge to Ethereum
3) Optimism Bridge to Ethereum
4) Transfer Funds Avalanche to Ethereum

@BGDLabs is to review and approve these contracts.

# Funding

To facilitate the development and implementation of the previously mentioned contracts, this publication seeks the following funding:

**Funding Amount:** $12,430.00, to be paid in GHO.
**Delivery Schedule:** The estimated timeframe for completion is approximately 5 weeks, which includes the review by @BGDLabs (an estimated 2 weeks).

The deliverables will undergo approval by @bgdlabs to ensure their completeness. The Avalanche bridge contract will play a pivotal role in moving funds from Avalanche to Ethereum, thereby providing support for the DAO's financial stability.

The transfer of funds as per the approved amount will occur upon the successful delivery of the contracts. The Aave DAO is encouraged to vote on one of the following three options:

1) YAE
2) NAE
3) ABSTAIN

# Next Steps

1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will commence building the contracts.

The DAO is expected to uphold outcome of the Snapshot vote.

**Title:** [ARFC] Add gmBTC on Arbitrum V3 
**Author:** 0xlide - SaucyBlock
**Date:** 2024-02-05

---
## Summary
This publication presents the community an opportunity to add gmBTC on the Arbitrum Aave v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Motivation
GMX Protocol is the largest DEX offering derivatives and one of the most popular DeFi’s today. The introduction of several new features and integration with Chainlink Data Stream in GMX V2 has significantly reduced the risks of front-running and price manipulation compared to GMX V1. gmBTC is a BTC-USD's Liquidity Token on the GMX V2 and earn fees from leverage trading, borrowing fees and swaps. 

Integrating gmBTC as collateral asset in the Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool has the potential to create new demand for borrowable assets on Aave V3.

## Specification 
Ticker: gmBTC
Contract Adress: [0x47c031236e19d024b42f8AE6780E44A573170703](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x47c031236e19d024b42f8AE6780E44A573170703)

Title: [ARC] ETH Interest Rate Curve Update
Author: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @Dydymoon 
Dated: 2022-11-05

---

# Simple Summary

@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend ETH interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2 and Ethereum v3 (when deployed) Liquidity Pools.

# Abstract

With Aave v3 about to be deployed on Ethereum and a wstETH and ETH eMode likely, the ETH Interest Rate should be adjusted such that the looped recursive strategy breaks even within Slope 1 where the Interest Rate changes are less volatile.

The new interest rate curve has an Interest Rate of 5.75% at the Uoptimal point, which is 25 bps more than stETH yield at the time of writing. This proposal will lead to improved capital efficiency of the ETH Reserve and generate more revenue for the DAO when compared to just replicating the v2 Interest Rate curve on v3 with the introduction of an ETH eMode Category.

For the existing v2 market, @llamaxyz suggests adopting the same Interest Rate parameters as being proposed on v3. This will enable the ETH yields across the markets to somewhat equalize leading to higher utilization of the ETH Reserve and more revenue for the DAO.

# Motivation

By changing the Interest Rate at the Uopotimal point from 3% to 5.75%, when an eMode for ETH and wstETH is created on Aave v3 the recursive strategy will break even prior to reaching the Uoptimal utilization within the Reserve. This is a desirable feature as the volatility of the Interest Rate on Slope 1 is less than Slope 2. By setting the Slope 1 parameter at 5.75%, 25 bps greater than the current annual wstETH yield, utilization in the Reserve is not expected to reach the Uoptimal level for any prolonged period of time. By reducing the Slope 2 parameter, from 100 to 80, the gradient of the second part of the yield curve increases due to an increase in Uoptimal from 70% to 80%. This is subtle and can be seen in the chart below. The Base Rate for the existing Interest Rate and proposed Interest Rate is unchanged at 0%.

With the new Interest Rate curve recommended for the v3 deployment, it is reasonable to expect the yield across the v2 and v3 deployment to be arbitraged. If the yield on the v3 deployment converges to the wstETH rate, then this will shift the v2 Reserve utilization beyond the Uoptimal level set at 3%. Because of this, it is recommended to also change the v2 Interest Rate to match the v3 deployment Interest Rate. This way both v2 and v3 Reserves will experience utilization along the Slope 1 portion of the Interest Rate curve whilst also benefiting from improved capital efficiency.

The graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.

![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y8ecsyo-6itRFl1OYcFSwfkFvouFWxFad8CC-bjso4Q0D2ya_bSLCosOoh1Z2e8VhSIR8mqSH5srOrah6zPXGRPZs_vcukByDXmknVZOndIeYWe_uX-AaicOPPJB-WviEbyRY1O5ylKgwW-uQxyqyJQ6MtBt3ltJ50wzx4tBmUu3BCq5X2ABiilAsqjz4A ""Chart"")

This proposal increases the Reserve Factor from 10% to 15%, directing 15% of the interest paid to Aave DAO. When combined with the Interest Rate changes, the v2 deployment will generate an estimated $13.1k per day, up from around $5.5k per day. Prior to this proposal, due the implementation of AIP-68, the Aave DAO is earning less revenue from the ETH Reserve post merge despite utilization within the Reserve increasing significantly over that time, [2].

# Specification

The below table shows the current and proposed changes to the ETH Reserve on Ethereum v2 and Ethereum v3 when deployed.

|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Uoptimal|70|80|
|Base|0|0|
|Slope1|3.0|5.75|
|Slope2|100|80|
|Reserve Factor|10|15|

title: [ARFC] Safety Module - Polygon & Avalanche Coverage Update
author: @TokenLogic
created: 2023-09-03

---

# Summary

This publication proposes updating the Safety Module (SM) coverage across the various iterations of Aave Protocol on Polygon and Avalanche networks.

SM coverage is to be removed from Polygon v2 and Avalanche v2 deployments and extended to Avalanche v3.

# Motivation

With the continued migration of users from v2 to v3, this publication seeks to further encourage users to migrate by removing the SM coverage for Aave v2 deployments on the Polygon and Avalanche networks.

During 2023, the total market size on Avalanche and Polygon Aave v2 Protocol deployments has been trending lower. At the time of writing the total market size of Aave v2 on Avalanche and Polygon is $36.2M and $134.7M respectively. For comparison, the Aave v3 deployment on each network is $199.8M and $229.9M respectively. 

By removing SM coverage for Avalanche and Polygon v2 deployments, Aave DAO will no longer be providing coverage for the outdated iterations of Aave Protocol with exception of the Aave ARC deployment. By removing the SM coverage, users are further encouraged to migrate to v3.

The Polygon Aave v3 deployment is already covered by the SM whilst the Avalanche v3 deployment is not cover by the SM. This publication seeks to extend the SM coverage to include Avalanche v3. Therefore both v3 iterations are covered by the SM and v2 iterations are not covered on Polygon and Avalanche. 

For reference, at the time of writing, the following Aave Protocol deployments are covered by the SM:

* Ethereum v2
* [Ethereum v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2cbfeb5c5329c4d1720dbae4045386fceb2d2a9bd5b42a81cee47ea5c934f491)
* [Polygon v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7da4985b2d5b1cbe6bbc0992d5c86030cedef2013487e4b53b4244c315c90155)

# Specification

It is important to note based upon the current implementation of the SM, an adhoc AIP is required to implement a Shortfall Event.

The following Snapshot votes will be created to enable granular voting:

* Extend SM Coverage to Avalanche v3
* Remove SM Coverage for Polygon v2
* Remove SM Coverage for Avalanche v2

Upon conclusion of the Snapshot vote, if approved, SM coverage will be removed/extended to the respective market.

There is no need for an AIP to implement this upgrade.

253,"## Goal of the Vote

This snapshot vote is to gather community sentiment toward reallocating the inactive voting power that was initially delegated during the Bootstrap Delegate initiative evenly across the self-nominated community members.

*Note that this proposal is a variation of the original experiment proposed in the governance forum in two ways that are described below.*

## Scope

The forum post on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549).

In summary, the goal of the proposed experiment is to reactivate inactive voting power in response to the drop in overall voting participation over the past 18 months by empowering new community members.

Over the past week, 7 community members have self-nominated themselves to be considered for the reallocated voting power. Below is an alphabetized list of them linked to their self-nomination:

* [Aishwary](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/4)
* [Celo](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/12)
* [Daniel](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/8)
* [GFX Labs](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/5)
* [Flipside Crypto](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/2)
* [Koppany](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/13)
* [Patrick](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/3)

If this vote is successful, the 3M cumulative voting power that was initially delegated to SonOfPegasus and DeFi Saver will be evenly reallocated across these 7 new community members. 

As noted in the top of this vote description, this proposal differs from the original one presented in the governance forum in both process and outcome.  
* (1) instead of 2 snapshot votes, one to measure sentiment around reallocating inactive voting power and one to indicate support for individuals to receive that reallocation, the variation is 1 snapshot vote to measure sentiment to reallocate inactive voting power to all self-nominated community members;
* (2) instead of reallocating to 3 new members, the variation is to reallocate to all 7 self-nominated members.

**Given that the goal was to increase the number of individuals/groups participating in governance, I believe that these changes are appropriate and do not introduce any significant deviation.**

If this vote passes, there will also be one more snapshot vote to measure community sentiment for delegate compensation which is the second component of the proposed experiment.

254,"##### ABSTRACT
The purpose of this proposal is to give voting rights back to the broader ApeCoinDAO community and its delegations for Working Group Steward positions.

The Ape Assembly was established as a Governance Working Group Initiative outlined in AIP-239, aiming to facilitate Working Group Steward elections. However, with as few as twenty active voters in recent weeks, there are growing concerns about the legitimacy that those elections would carry. Furthermore, we need Stewards who have experience in conducting significant outreach within the ApeCoin DAO community, which only DAO-wide campaigns can provide.

Currently, there will be four new Stewards elected in the upcoming Metaverse and Marketing and Communications Working Group elections scheduled to commence Nov 1, 2023, with approval to execute critical functions for the DAO moving forward.

To address these issues and enhance overall voting participation, this proposal recommends shifting future Working Group Steward elections from the Ape Assembly to a tried and true DAO-wide voting structure.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
This AIP benefits the ApeCoin ecosystem by ensuring that Working Groups meet their mandates of providing critical functions and services to the DAO, and continuing to provide a voice for the broader ApeCoin DAO community through their ability to vote, while maintaining consistency with all other elections.

This AIP adheres to the DAO’s values of Collective Responsibility and Boldness by taking decisive action to address this issue of representation in Working Group Steward elections, and working towards progress over perfection.

256,"Summary
A proposal for continuous market risk management to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses.

Background
Venus’s previous interest rate model 6 and conversations with the Venus team shows the importance protocol stakeholders put towards understanding and mitigating risk. Over the past few years, Gauntlet has deployed our simulation platform to similar lending protocols and we are happy to state Gauntlet’s work has resulted in strengthening protocol structure and we continue to make parameter recommendations to optimize for capital efficiency as well as reduce insolvency risk.

Preventing insolvency is not the only market risk Venus faces. Deflationary spirals and shocks to market prices can’t simply be prevented without reducing the protocol’s utility. Tail-event scenarios are rarely the result of bad actors taking malicious actions against the protocol. The vast majority of Venus’s participants are honest but what’s good for the lender is not always good for the borrower. Depositors lend, borrowers borrow, and liquidators rebalance. This intersection is where Gauntlet comfortably sits, directing traffic per the stated desires of the community.

Gauntlet will onboard and then continuously rerun our simulations for the Venus Protocol, pushing regular changes to ensure optimal risk parameters. We will also deploy our asset listing framework to ensure new assets being proposed for the Venus Protocol meet the market risk standards that the community has set forth.

Title: [ARC] SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool
Staus: Proposal
Author: @llamaxyz @MatthewGraham
Dated: 2022-11-14

---

# Simple Summary

@llamaxyz proposed assigning the SD `Emission_Admin` role on the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool to a Gnosis Safe controlled by the Stader Labs.

# Abstract

The Stader Labs team intends to distribute SD incentives to the MaticX Reserve on Polygon Aave v3.

In order to achieve this, the `EmissionManager` contract needs to assign an owner to the `Emission_Admin` permission allowing SD rewards to be distributed, [1,2]. This can only be achieved via the governance process.

This proposal assigns the `Emission_Admin` permission to SD rewards to the following address `matic:0x51358004cFe135E64453d7F6a0dC433CAba09A2a`.

# Motivation

The motivation of the proposal is to enable SD rewards to be distributed on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.

Please do note a similar request was submitted enabling the distribution of LDO and stMATIC rewards by Lido and the Polygon Foundation respectively across the Polygon Aave v3 liquidity pool, [3,4].

# Specification

The Stader Labs team will determine the emission rate and duration SD rewards are offered. This will likely be influenced by the Aave DAO’s ability to adjust the wMATIC and MaticX risk parameters that enable users to generate a return from leverage the MaticX / wMATIC loop.

The `Emission_Admin` is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool. The `EmissionManager` role grants the SD `Emission_Admin` role to a specified wallet address. The `Emission_Admin` can distribute SD rewards across the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool.

# Implementation

Set `Emission_Admin` permission for SD (`matic:0x1d734A02eF1e1f5886e66b0673b71Af5B53ffA94`) on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool to Stader Lab’s address: `matic:0x51358004cFe135E64453d7F6a0dC433CAba09A2a`, [5,6].

A proposal to whitelist Connext, a trust minimized cross chain protocol, for V3 Portals on 6 chains: Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony - with credit lines for USDC ($2m on each chain), USDT ($1m on each chain) and ETH (40 ETH on each chain).

## Reasonale

[Connext](https://connext.network) is a network for **fast, trustless communication between chains and rollups**. It is the only interoperability system of its type that does this cheaply and quickly without introducing any new trust assumptions. Connext is aimed at developers who are looking to build bridges and other natively **cross-chain applications**.
To date, over $1.3b in transactions have crossed the network.

Our network of liquidity providers only works with native assets, or the most canonical representation of a wrapped asset.

With our [Amarok upgrade](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4), a series of improvements are coming for users, developers and liquidity providers (routers): the latest will be tasked with providing capital upfront to the users, while getting refunded within 30 minutes when the slower confirmation, coming from the [Optimistic communication protocol Nomad](https://blog.connext.network/optimistic-bridges-fb800dc7b0e0), is completed.

Users’ transactions get confirmed in seconds, LPs get rewarded with a fee on the transaction for their service.

**Portals are therefore a perfect match for Connext as our LPs will need and want to access immediate extra liquidity to fulfill transactions, and our new architecture allows for this operation to be completed via the protocol in a trust minimized way**.

## Technical Specifications

Connext is much more than a bridge, it’s an **interoperability protocol**: it allows to build cross chain applications without adding trust assumptions.
One of these applications are bridges, others could be cross chain NFTs marketplaces or cross chain governance portals.

**51 routers are currently providing $40m+ of liquidity.**
The highly capital efficient architecture of Connext allows for higher volume (and therefore higher returns) with less capital compared to other solutions in the space.
The system is currently working on a whitelist basis. Once the [NEXT token](https://blog.connext.network/whats-next-d3044de49397) is live, the whole network will be permissionless.

## How does it work?

This is an overview of the Amarok architecture that is currently on testnet and planned to go live in a few weeks:

![image](ipfs://QmZVvSsU5ra6vFvMiu82iMAieP1LFuS44EjsbLJVkeUj8N)

The new flow heavily utilizes Nomad (and eventually other localized messaging layers) for its security model. Routers front capital and execute calls for a user’s transaction, and claim against funds going through Nomad.


A full overview can be found [here](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4).

This model fits with the Aave Portals. This is how the simplified architecture integrating Portals will look like - credits to Delphi Digital for the image.

([Development progress deep dive](https://github.com/connext/nxtp/pull/1074)).

The logic for the execute and reconcile methods for the Aave portals has been completed and is ready for audit.

#### Is there a fee model for participants?
LPs currently take a 5bps fee from every transaction

## Proposed list Credit Line request

The credit lines are requested for the following networks where both Connext and Aave are already present.

Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony

Note: Routers providers are charging 5 bps to complete cross chain transactions.
All outstanding loans are repaid within 60 min (avg 30 min), effectively paying a high interest rate: 0.005% / 60 min → 44% APR

#### Incentives
A Liquidity Mining program might be approved by the DAO once the NEXT token goes live.

Title: [ARFC] Harmonize USDT Risk Parameters on Aave V3 Markets 
Author: Aave Chan Initiative
Created: 2023-11-11

---

# Summary

USDT has various risk parameters across the various Aave v3 markets. This proposals aims to harmonize the risk parameters to better align the markets by removing USDT from isolation mode and normalizing risk parameters.

# Motivation

USDT has seen strong borrow demand across networks with borrow utilization over 50% on Aave v3 Ethereum Mainnet and good utilization on secondary networks. However, the various markets currently have different risk parameters, leading to some inefficiency.

This proposal aims to bring the various USDT markets in line with a single set of LTV, liquidation threshold, and liquidation bonus parameters.

# Specification

The proposal sets the LT/LTV of USDT on all deployments at 80/77, matching that of DAI and USDC on v3 Ethereum. Regarding the LB, it will stay the same at 5% on the L2s and 4.5% on Ethereum.

266,"Summary

Arbitrum One is the leading Ethereum Rollup, and has seen significant traction over the last several months. Arbitrum One has hundreds of live applications and infrastructure supporting the chain and deploying Aave on Arbitrum would be mutually beneficial for both communities.

Proposal

Deploy Aave V3 on Arbitrum. Aave V3 is revolutionary and should be deployed on the most cutting edge and up-and-coming platforms.

Rationale

Arbitrum is the leading Ethereum Rollup, with hundreds of live apps including most top Ethereum apps and infrastructure including Alchemy, Balancer, Chainlink (23 active price feeds), Curve, Gnosis Safe, Infura, Sushiswap, Uniswap, Quicknode, and many others. A more complete list can be found at https://portal.arbitrum.one. While Arbitrum has strong DeFi adoption, it lacks a strong lending platform, and Aave V3 would fill that gap proving beneficial for both communities.

Arbitrum has over 2.5B in TVL that Aave can tap into, and indeed Arbitrum's TVL accounts for 47.8% of TVL across all Ethereum L2s tracked by L2Beat. Arbitrum also has numerous direct fiat on-ramps, CEX integrations, and application layer bridges making it simple for users to bridge liquidity onto the platform.",bullish

title: [ARFC] Gas Rebate for Recognized Delegates
author: @lbsblockchain, @MarcZeller Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
created: 2023-05-31
---

## Abstract

This ARFC introduces a mechanism for reimbursing gas fees to recognized delegates who vote on-chain on Aave.

## Motivation

As Ethereum gas fees continue to rise, the cost of on-chain governance for delegates has proportionally increased. This ARFC proposes a rebate system for these gas fees, aiming to incentivize active engagement and cultivate a more diverse voter base.

Rebating delegates for their participation offers several benefits:

- Encourages more active engagement from the delegate community by eliminating the disincentive to vote, leading to better decision-making for Aave.
- Fosters a more diverse voter base, including student organizations, by reducing the barrier to entry for voting. This creates a more open and collaborative delegate ecosystem, driving participation.
- Helps retain top delegates to foster the growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being an excellent Aave delegate should not result in a net cost to the delegate due to ever-increasing gas costs.
- Can be achieved at a relatively low cost. We also propose measures to reduce the administrative burden for Aave.

## Specification

### Claiming Process

Every quarter, an ARFC will be proposed (with the current one being the first) to publish an AIP reimbursing gas fees spent by recognized delegates.

These gas fees are determined by an open-source script written by @JosepBove, which allows anyone to generate a JSON file of recognized delegates' gas spending.

This script can be run and verified by any community member to approve the amounts distributed to recognized delegates.

Once a consensus has been reached on an ARFC, an appointed Governance Facilitator will submit an AIP to transfer aWETH to the delegate's address. We initially propose that the Aave Chan Initiative serves as the Governance Facilitator.

### Gas Rebate Token

We propose that the Gas Rebate Token be wETH.

Summary

The BitTorrent DAO Community asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into BitTorrent Chain (known as BTTC), which can expand lending to the BitTorrent community and, with the provision of incentives, bootstrap the launch of Aave on a new ecosystem.

Proposer

BitTorrent Chain is an open-source, EVM-compatible blockchain that offers high concurrency, higher submission speed, lower transaction fees, and smoother operations. Since BTTC is fully-compatible with TRON, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain, users are able to transfer mainstream assets among TRON, Ethereum, and BSC in a decentralized manner. Openness and accessibility are core values that we practice through our cross-chain strategy, and we find that aligns well with Aave goals.

We seek to support Aave in its multichain expansion and invite Aave to enable the Aave v2 front-end for BTTC. We believe that BTTC is ready-made to support Aave: BTTC offers a secure infrastructure (multi-node validation), heterogeneous cross-chain solution, faster transaction confirmation (PoS consensus mechanism with an average block time between 2-3 seconds) , and lower transaction fees (<$0.01 on average).

As the Layer 2 of TRON, BTTC inherits the advanced technology and resources from TRON, as well as $1.1bn TRON Ecosystem Fund. Since TRON’s MainNet release on May 31, 2018, TRON has risen to become the world’s fastest-growing public chain and the world’s largest network in terms of stablecoin settlement. Currently TRON boasts a staggering $70 billion worth of assets, over 66 million TRON accounts, and more than 39.9 billion TRC20-USDT in circulation on its network.

Moreover, BTTC integrates with Binance Smart Chain, which has one of the strongest deflationary mechanisms and currently has more daily active addresses than the rest of all layer 1s combined. That compatibility makes BTTC a better fit for DeFi applications like Aave.

We are convinced that BTTC is key to ushering in an era of connecting all chains, helping achieve rapid growth across the DeFi space, especially the Aave community.

Rationale

Current status of the BitTorrent Chain

BitTorrent Chain’s vision is to provide a high-performance, highly scalable, low-cost solution for blockchain platforms that delivers a superior user experience for decentralized applications without sacrificing decentralization while leveraging the existing developer ecosystem.

BTTC is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of consensus. As the first heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability protocol in the industry, users can transfer assets within TRON, Ethereum, BSC without any limits. The PoS consensus network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 2-3 seconds, making the network an incredible homecourt for DeFi and other EVM applications.

Why is it good for the Aave ecosystem?

BTTC is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, economic, and instant finality. The BitTorrent DAO Community has allocated up to $1bn for users of the Aave protocol. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established TRON community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on BTTC will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.

There is great potential for synergy between BTTC and Aave. As a close partner of TRON, BTTC will be able to contribute more than $1bn on Aave, and there are already more than $800mn assets of BTTC community on the Aave. The TRON DeFi ecosystem is thriving: Total Value Locked across TRON DeFi protocols is $5.39bn and growing. Many well-known protocols such as JustLend, Sunswap, amongst others, have deployed on TRON. On BTTC, Aave would find many users eager to participate in lending markets and add value to the Aave network.

Besides, as BTTC integrates more mainstream public chains like BSC, it will ease down the process of interacting between users and Aave, and that will definitely catapult the Aave ecosystem to the next level.

Why is signaling necessary?

Consistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, we believe that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on–and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. Deploying the Aave protocol on BTTC will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.

## **Author: ACI**

## **Date: 2024-07-19**

> Proposal updated with Risk Params provided by Risk Service Providers. 2024-07-23

## **Summary:**

This ARFC seeks to add [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) Liquid Restaking Token weETH to Aave V3 on Scroll.

After the successful onboarding of weETH to [Aave v3 Ethereum](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=74&ipfsHash=0x227ef8b0f49775f64100ec697bc4e67b0739bd1ff08788b1f6b48a66e1d57bf7), [Arbitrum](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=76&ipfsHash=0x78778591515790b337fcdcc2a02d49dc58e98cad614c33d61e1173bc6194729d), and [Base](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboarding-of-weeth-to-aave-v3-on-base/17691), alongside recent Supply and Borrow Cap increases for weETH due to significant demand, this proposal will further increase the ability for Aave to service weETH demand from users.

This proposal will go direct-to-AIP following the asset onboarding framework.

## **Motivation:**

weETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer.

[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) has also launched weETH on Arbitrum and Base allowing L2 users to get exposure to LRT yield and points. As weETH has already been approved for onboarding to Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base by the DAO, this proposal extends the onboarding of weETH to Aave v3 on Scroll.

## **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:**

weETH deposits into Aave on Scroll will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) and EigenLayer points and Scroll Marks.

## **Specification:**

weETH on Scroll: [0x01f0a31698c4d065659b9bdc21b3610292a1c506](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x01f0a31698c4d065659b9bdc21b3610292a1c506)

# Summary

This publication proposes updating Aave DAO's stable coin holdings in preparation for the emergence of several service provider proposals. Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.

# Motivation

The below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)

The is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.

In the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:

* Security (Certora, Sigma)
* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) 
* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))
* Marketing (Aave Companies)
* Delegates (6 teams)
* Liquidity Committee (GLC)

Assuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.

The GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.

The previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:

* $375k ACI (6 months)
* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)
* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)
* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)

Total: $1,721k GHO

The DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.

This proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.

The DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).

However, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.

## Security Service Providers

Aave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.

* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)
* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)
* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)

This proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. 

For the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.

## Bug Bounty Program

The Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.

## Risk Service Providers

During 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.

Based upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.

## Voting Service Providers

The current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.

We note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.

## Financial Service Providers

A budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. 

** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**

## Marketing Service Provider

Currently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.

## GHO Liquidity Committee

The GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.

$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. 

## Growth Service Provider

The ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.

## Development Service Provider

The @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.

## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider

The AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.

## Safety Module

Expenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.

## Funding

Over the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:

* $1.5M - Security (6 months)
* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)
* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)
* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)
* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)
* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)

Total: 5.1M USD

All Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. 

Risk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.

There is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.

The ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.

An additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.

Additional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.

# Specification

This proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:

* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI
* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)
* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)

Swap the following asset holdings to GHO:

* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)
* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)
* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)
* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)
* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)

Bridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:

* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury
* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury
* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury

The USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:

* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3
* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3
* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3
* Swap 700k USDC to GHO

Upon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:

* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)
* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)
* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)
* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)

The above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. 

# Next Steps

1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

Whilst we advocate for having 12 months on runway readily available in the right asset configuration. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.

As mentioned within the proposal, during Q4 2023, a publication relating to the DAOs overal budget allocation will be shared.

title: [ARFC] Avalanche wAVAX Interest Rate Upgrade
Author: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham)
Dated: 2023-02-03

---

# Summary

@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend the wAVAX interest rate parameters on the Aave Avalanche v3 Liquidity Pool.

# Abstract

Llama is working with Chaos Labs to revise the sAVAX risk parameters needed to enable more funds to flow into the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX on Avalanche v3 Liquidity Pool. This proposal will focus on revising the AVAX interest rate parameters with the goal of improving the capital efficiency of the wAVAX reserve and increasing Aave’s wAVAX revenue.

With a revised higher SupplyCap on sAVAX, we expect this to lead to an increase in the adoption of the recursive yield strategy. Increasing the availability of wAVAX supports the growth in TVL and revenue accruing to Aave with the sAVAX SupplyCap becoming the primary means limiting the adoption of the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX.

# Motivation

Llama has been in discussions with various parties to develop a yield curve that supports adoption of the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX on Avalanche v3. The strategy is modelled to be attractive whilst the utilisation of the wAVAX reserve is less than the Uoptimal point.

Interest Rate at the Uoptimal point is calculated as shown below.

Base + Slope1 = 70% x (LST Yield + sAVAX Deposit Incentives / 2) / ( 98% x sAVAX eMode LTV)

Base + Slope1 = 70% x (7.2% + 0.41% / 2) / (98% x 92.5%)) = 4.72%

This approach reflects the following considerations:

* Deposit rewards on sAVAX significantly affect the profitability of the strategy by offsetting wAVAX borrowing costs
  * Yield earned is sAVAX yield (7.2%) + deposit incentives (0.41%)
* sAVAX deposit rewards are diluted with more deposits, ie: 50% growth in sAVAX deposits.
* Recursive strategy operates narrowly within the LTV of sAVAX eMode TVL
  * 98% of the 92.5% LTV via Avax Correlated eMode
* Recursive strategy is only attractive whilst generate supportive risk adjusted yield
  * Looping 6 times generates around double the LST yield at Uoptimal utilisation, this is how the 70% figure is derived. This does not takes into consideration leverage transaction costs which could lead up to 1.5% of the principle and incur a 2-3 week break even period. It is assume users stay within the strategy for an extended period of time.

The current recursive strategy sAVAX/wAVAX is generating around 23.9% with a low wAVAX utilisation due to the SupplyCap for sAVAX has been reached. This yield will fall as the wAVAX utilisation increases. Assuming the SupplyCap for sAVAX is doubled, the current wAVAX interest rate curve becomes the limiting factor on the profitability of the strategy. The SupplyCap on wAVAX has a utilisation of 24.35% and offers considerable deposit capacity. There was no BorrowCap for wAVAX at the time this proposal was drafted.

To reduce the volatility in the borrow rate between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal, a Base of 1% is introduced whilst keeping the Base + Slope1 interest rate as calculated above. This generates a Slope1 of 4.72%.

Adjusting the Uoptimal parameter improved the capital efficiency of the AVAX reserve. Adjusting from 45% to 65% is a substantial increase. The current utilisation is a lot lower, 28.49% and is expected to increase substantially, possibly 56.98% when the sAVAX SupplyCap is to be doubled. This is still short of the 65% Uoptimal parameter and offers users an attractive yield on the strategy. With future SupplyCap increases, the Uoptimal parameter can be revised. With a Uoptimal of 65%, there remain sufficient liquidity in the reserve to liquidate users. It is also worth noting a $5.055m USDC swap for wAVAX incurs a 2% price impact via 1inch.

The Slope2 parameter has been reduced from 300% to 144.28% to generate a borrow rate of 150% at 100% utilisation. This reduced the volatility when utilisation is in the Uoptimal < Utilisation <100% range. When utilisation is in this range the recursive strategy is not generating sufficient reward relative to holding sAVAX and will lead to strategy reducing leverage and therefore utilisation of the wAVAX reserve. Because of this relationship a gradual increase in borrowing interest is preferable and thus a lower Slope2 parameter can be implemented.

# Specification

The following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama.

|Parameter|Proposed Value|
| --- | --- |
|Variable Base|1.00%|
|Uoptimal|65.00%|
|Variable Slope1|4.72%|
|Variable Slope2|144.28%|
|Stable Borrowing |Disabled|
|Stable Slope1 |4.72%|
|Stable Slope2 |144.28%|
|Base Stable Rate Offset |4%|
|Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5%|
|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20%|

Stable rates have been updated to mitigate any risk of enabling stable borrowing and having a variable borrow rate greater than the stable borrowing rate.

A proposal to make parameter changes on the Polygon Aave v3 market. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-cap-recommendations-for-polygon-v3-2023-11-03/15327).


## Motivation

Per Gauntlet’s supply and borrow cap methodology, we recommend setting supply and borrow caps for agEUR and jEUR. Currently agEUR borrowing is disabled as borrowing and cannot be used as collateral. jEUR is frozen. Despite this, all assets should have supply and borrow caps.




## Specification

| Chain | Asset | Cap | Current | Recommended |
|-------|-------|-----|---------|-------------|
| Polygon | agEUR | Supply | - | 300k |
| Polygon | agEUR | Borrow | - | 250k |
| Polygon | jEUR | Supply | - | 120k |
| Polygon | jEUR | Borrow | - | 100k |

280,"title: [ARC] Add Safety module support for Aave V3 Ethereum market

Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative

Dated: 2023-01-31

# Simple Summary
This proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to add Aave Ethereum V3 support for the safety Module

# Abstract
The Safety Module is a set of smart contracts allowing AAVE & aBPT (representing Balancer V1 ETH/AAVE LP) token holders to stake their tokens in exchange for a share of the distribution of Safety Incentives sourced from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.

Stakers in the safety module, lock their liquidity for a minimum of 10 days, and in the case of a shortfall event affecting the covered Aave markets, expose their stake assets to be mobilized to cover excess protocol debt up to 30% of their staked funds.

This AIP proposes to extend the coverage of the Safety module to Aave V3 Ethereum Contracts.

# Motivation
Aave V3 is the most recent implementation of the Aave protocol, allowing new features, optimizations, and mitigation of risks.

Aave V3 has been battle tested for ~10 months in several networks, and its code was deemed safe enough to be allowed deployment on the Ethereum mainnet by the Aave governance.

The ACI is supportive of extending coverage of Aave V3 by the safety module in order to offer the V3 Ethereum users the same level of coverage as V2 users.

While the current version of the safety module has room for improvement and would benefit from a re-engineering and improved implementation, it’s the currently available tool, and the deployment of V3 makes it a suitable candidate to cover Aave V3 users on Ethereum.

# Specification
It is important to note that in the current implementation of the Safety module, a potential shortfall event needs to be implemented individually by an ad hoc AIP.

This proposal is then more a community guideline that sets precedence on Aave decision to support V3 in case of a shortfall event impacting the V3 market.

For this reason, this ARC, if consensus is found, can escalate to a snapshot vote but does not require a payload execution triggered by an AIP vote.

a Snapshot outcome thus would be considered canon without requiring an AIP on-chain vote with an empty payload.

281,"#### ABSTRACT

This AIP supports the MVP launch of an outdoor digital billboard network, with a primary objective of establishing a long-term sustainable business model that; helps fund the ApeCoin DAO treasury, establishes new use cases for $APE, expands the community of $APE builders, while providing the world with a progressively decentralized platform to showcase messaging and art.

We’ve bootstrapped this startup on our initiative, with our own money, and designed it to provide numerous direct benefits to the $APE ecosystem. We’re asking the $APE community to help us accelerate the concept and increase its chances of success. We hope that by leading with actions instead of promises, with our skin in the game first, and by placing a high priority on driving direct value to the DAO, the Ape community will choose to support this.

If this AIP passes, then; 20% of all top-line revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin DAO treasury until the full cost of this AIP is returned. Anyone can earn a 10% rewards payout from all referrals. Every wallet hodling at least 5k $APE as at January 1st, 2024, will receive free display space on a first come first serve basis. Furthermore, for however long the Ape community continues to support this initiative, a further 1% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin Treasury on-going, plus a quantity of TBD display space will be reserved for use by the ApeCoin DAO, and our Network of frens and fam, such as those at Mocaverse, BAYC, MAYC, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild, and Ape Delegates, for life.

The outdoor digital advertising industry is ripe for disruption and we’re all positioned to spearhead and benefit from this for years to come. Our modernized approach to this old-school industry offers the potential to generate substantially increased operating margins than competitors and opens up the total addressable market (TAM) by an order of magnitude. The conservative financial request in this AIP covers six months of runway for my team and I to carry out up to two consecutive MVP engagements aimed at positioning this initiative for sustainable revenue generation and future scaling.

I initiated this project in Q4 2019 with a personal investment of approximately $40,000. However, the onset of the Covid lockdown in Q1 2020 forced me to put the project on hold. I have now re-commenced the project with @thebossdragon as CTO, having injected a further $10,000 of my own capital in recent weeks.

The first MVP engagement takes place over a 10-day period during the Ethereum Denver Blockchain/Web3 Event scheduled for February/March 2024, with an anticipated attendance of approximately 15,000 Ethereum-related enthusiasts. We’ve leased a truck equipped on 3-sides with sizeable digital display screens to roam the streets of the event area. Its mission is to display messages and art, while recruiting more builders into the Ape ecosystem, and providing all hodlers of at least 1 $APE with an opportunity to help drive value into the DAO treasury while earning rewards for themselves too. If successful, the model will then scale beyond mobile advertising to encompass highway billboards, transit vehicles, bus stop displays, elevator displays, and more.

Accessibility and speed are key features of this initiative. Anyone can purchase a display spot at any time for the minimum purchase price of 0.001 ETH, and have their messaging displayed within 60 seconds or less. Anyone holding 1 $APE can earn referral rewards, and anyone who pays with $APE receives bonus display time for free. Furthermore, a portion of all ad space will be reserved for free use by the ApeCoin DAO as it sees fit, and for our ecosystem frens. One such use could be the promotion of a ‘Build with $APE’ introductory guide and promotional video, which is included in the budget of this AIP, and which would be integrated into this project’s website: [publicbored.com](http://www.publicbored.com/).

The proposed budget encompasses technology development, website development, display rental expenses, marketing efforts, and a total of twelve months to transition into a self-sustaining model.

Subsequent MVP engagements are TBD in 2024.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

1. 20% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin DAO treasury until the full cost of this AIP is returned.
2. Anyone can earn a 10% rewards/payout for all referrals who purchase display time on the digital billboard
4. On-going royalties plus free ads: for as long as the Ape community continues to support this initiative, a further 1% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin Treasury on-going, plus a quantity of TBD ad space on all billboards everywhere shall always be reserved for use by the ApeCoin DAO, and our Network of frens and fam, such as $APE hodlers, Mocaverse, BAYC, MAYC, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild, and Ape Delegates hodling 50k $APE or more, for life.
5. Bonus, free display time is also given to everyone who pays in $APE.
6. Free display space is reserved exclusively for ApeCoin DAO use, such as for recruiting more builders into the Ape ecosystem.
7. We also aim to help recruit more $APE builders, via a guide for new AIP authors posted directly on the Public Bored website to help direct website traffic towards the DAO, or similar.
8. 25% of all revenue generated will be converted into and held in $APE on-going, until the funds need to be used, in which case we will actively seek to pay expenses in $APE wherever practical. For example, part of the cost of the billboard truck has been paid for directly using $APE. This was their first time accepting $APE as payment, and only happened because I specifically asked them to. It was a fun discussion, and they are excited :slight_smile: 

#### OVERALL COST

Total Budget: 75,000 $APE

Approximate allocations:
* Digital Display Truck: 15k $APE
  * Acquisition of cutting-edge mobile canvas
* Website & Technology Development: 20k $APE
  * Advancing innovation through web and tech
* Marketing: 10k $APE
  * Strategic campaigns to amplify impact
* Staffing and Related Expenses: 15k $APE
  * Committed to nurturing a skilled team for twelve consecutive months
* Transportation & Rentals: 5k $APE
  * Facilitating logistics for seamless execution
* Direct Sales: 5k $APE
  * Hands-on engagement for strategic growth
* Miscellaneous Expenses: 5k $APE
  * Navigating unforeseen challenges with resilience
* Possible Second & Third Event Budgets (TBD, based on revenues generated)

## Summary:

This proposal aims to progress a 6-month relationship between Aave and Flipside Crypto, creating sustainable frameworks, resources, and operational support.

This proposal incorporates key feedback from existing service providers and the community, shifting the scope to focus on existing capabilities and operational efficiency.

## Motivation:

Flipside has been a long-standing steward of Aave, contributing to multiple initiatives. We have been a previous grant recipient, 2nd ever delegate, and strategic growth partner.

This proposal seeks to cement Flipside’s role and further invest in services and resources toward a more sustainable, more engaged, and clearer future.

In particular, the proposal addresses increased diversity in the delegate base, up-to-date documentation, framework development, data availability, and community resources.

This proposal is aimed to be a low-cost way of introducing and investing in these services while encouraging delivery and a short renewal.

## Specification:

To initiate the service contract, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with flipsidecrypto2.eth (0x1ef753934C40a72a60EaB12A68B6f8854439AA78) as the recipient.

In terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()`method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a 180-day stream of 125,000 USDC. If successful, Flipside will offer and perform the following services on a 6-month basis:

### Services & KPIs:


### *1. Operational Efficiency*

  * Contribute to and update documentation related to [Governance Guide](https://docs.aave.com/governance/)

291,"### ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to introduce an NFT event check-in solution based on ApeChain, combining hardware products (NFC chips and scanners) and software products (an app based on ApeChain) to provide NFT holders with an immersive experience at all NFT offline events.

*Specific Implementation Plan:*

In terms of hardware products, we will use NFC technology combined with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) to embed NFC chips into peripheral products, including clothing, hats, toys, and skateboards. We will also design and manufacture NFC scanners to detect products with NFC chips and read selected NFT image data in an app based on ApeChain, then display on a large screen to realize the conceptual scenario of NFT as our web3 identity and participate in real offline events. Simultaneously, scanners will also be used to support the “Unmanned check-in” model in Merch stores.

In terms of software products, we will develop an app based on ApeChain, offering features such as wallet connecting, NFT selection, and animated scene corresponding to the ticket you purchased. The app will provide a user-friendly interface for NFT holders to easily use the check-in system. All check-in animations can be individually created and saved by users, forming a unique user-generated content (UGC) culture, which also makes it easier to spread within communities and out of the web3. For event organizers, animating event tickets to become a unique background for attendees can help expand the brand’s influence and generate much higher traffic than traditional marketing methods.

This solution will fully leverage the image of all NFTs, providing NFT holders with a more immersive experience and enriching existing methods of peripheral product distribution. It will create unique and native web3 gameplay during the offline events and provide all NFTs with more practical value beyond avatars.


### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The proposed NFT event check-in solution will bring several benefits to the APECHAIN ecosystem:

* Enhanced Adoption and Engagement: By providing NFT holders with an immersive experience at web3 offline events, the solution will increase adoption and engagement within the $APE ecosystem. NFT holders will feel more connected to the ecosystem and be incentivized to participate in events and activities.
* Increased Visibility and Recognition: The innovative nature of the check-in solution, coupled with its use of ApeChain, will enhance the visibility and recognition of $APE in the broader market. This will attract more users, projects, and potential collaborators to the ecosystem, driving its growth and fostering a vibrant community.
* Diversification of Use Cases: The check-in solution will demonstrate the versatility of $APE beyond where we are right now, showcasing its potential in the realm of NFT event management and engagement. This diversification of use cases will attract new projects and investors to $APE, expanding its reach and utility.

Overall, the NFT event check-in solution will contribute to the growth and development of the APE CHAIN ecosystem, defining APE CHAIN as the primary chain for all NFTs and continuously providing value for all $APE holders.



### OVERALL COST 
Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 480,000 $APE The specific allocation is as follows:

1. Hardware Design and Production (50% of the budget, 240,000 $APE):

##### APECOIN REVENUE MODEL:
Single Instance Revenue Forecast

![Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 4.58.59 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreifltrbdt2idzmxfeipb6il7veqa5nzfw3lagkxvj2hh6snljhq2a4)
    
##### Total Revenue:* 120,000 $APE + Total Revenue * 1%

This table clearly outlines the revenue forecast for a single instance, providing a comprehensive view of the potential earnings from our proposed solution.

*50% of gross revenues will be returned to APECOIN DAO, in perpetuity.

NOTE:
* Fees will be charged for the services provided by the check-in solution and “Unmanned check-in” model, and only $APE will be used for payment.
* Offline merch stores adopting the “Unmanned check-in” model can only be paid with $APE.
* NFC customization will be charged separately and paid for using $APE.
* $APE will be consumed in the APP as Gas fee

By implementing this proposal, APECOIN will establish a robust check-in solution that benefits NFT holders, drives revenue growth, and expands its influence in the web3 space.

292,"Title: [ARC] Framework For Recognized Delegates

Author: @fig - Flipside Crypto

Date: 05-04-2023

---

## Summary:

This proposal establishes a baseline set of guidelines and expectations for becoming a Recognized Delegate within Aave.

It aims to define the role, responsibilities, and characteristics of Aave’s recognized delegates to aid the DAO in addressing and sustainably growing this stakeholder base.

It is left intentionally sparse in some parts to provide a rich and diverse array of delegates from which AAVE [or equivalent] holders may select their chosen representative(s.)

## Abstract:

This proposal responds to the community's desire to outline what a recognized delegate looks like, to qualify for potential reimbursement in the current Gas Fee Rebate proposal.

It creates a framework for becoming or ending one’s role as a recognized delegate.

In addition, it delineates the distinction between a delegate and a recognized delegate.

## Motivation:

As Aave attracts more stakeholders, contributors, and delegates, it requires more active management and a clearer organization of the delegate base.

A typical interaction with Governance (roughly) looks something like this:

![91572a4486b9001bdd6927a25f55c5a4f23608bb.png](ipfs://bafkreied3ex3txkxbesko2cf4g3cgn7milsd6sx2l3pz663h25pnxffhnq)
   

This graphic illustrates a current dynamic within the DAO; delegates working on behalf of token holders, engaging with Governance or contributors themselves to vote and propose on-chain.

The more voting power a delegate has (i.e. ACI, Penn Blockchain, LBS,) the larger their responsibility has become, incurring voting costs, deployment costs, and opportunity costs.

This proposal hopes to create a definition of value-additive, recognized delegates to better organize delegates and proposals such as the [Gas Fee Rebate.
](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gas-fee-rebate-for-on-chain-votes/12559)
Furthermore, it is crucial to define fundamental roles and responsibilities to align expectations between the Aave community, AAVE holders, service providers, and other delegates.

It is important to better define this role to encourage, educate, and guide prospective delegates, and re-affirm the ongoing work of others.

## Specification:

To be considered a recognized delegate, a prospective delegate must follow these key steps:

**1. Inform the community of their intention to become a delegate**

**2. Post a Delegate Platform on the Aave Governance forum - similar to those from [Wintermute](https://governance.aave.com/t/wintermute-delegate-platform/11504) or [FranklinDAO](https://governance.aave.com/t/franklindao-prev-penn-blockchain-delegate-platform/8850), under the “Delegate Platform” category**

*  The Delegate Platform is a chance for delegates to lay out what they stand for; it is the lens through which AAVE holders and other stakeholders will see Recognized Delegates and their actions.
*  As delegates grow and change, it is encouraged to update this platform so it reflects the progress and current goals of delegate

**3. Read and acknowledge the Delegate Code of Conduct**

*   The canonical Code of Conduct is defined [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-delegate-code-of-conduct/12981).
* Acknowledgment is left at the discretion of the delegate - some options include:
*Signing a message on-chain*
*Confirming that they have read and agreed to it within their Recognized Delegate platform post*
*Another creative option such as uploading to IPFS or Swarm :)*

**4. Demonstrate a history of voting on more than five on-chain votes**

**5. Maintain on-chain voting participation rate above 80%**

**6. Report voting rationales via a medium of choice; this could be Aave’s Governance Forum, Medium, Notion, or a personal blog**

## Roles & Responsibilities

The role of a Recognized Delegate can be expressed in three parts:

1. Participation in forum discussions
2. Expression of opinion in on & off-chain Governance processes by casting regular votes
3. Communication of their voting decisions and the rationale behind them

It is essential to the Governance process in Aave that Recognized Delegates vote, particularly regarding on-chain AIPs, as these execute the technical changes required for the operation and security of Aave.

By expecting Recognized Delegates to communicate their votes, we may ensure that there is sufficient transparency to allow delegators to evaluate whether their chosen Recognized Delegate is acting in their – and Aave's best interests.

This responsibility provides valuable feedback to proposal authors; if a proposal is unsuccessful, this feedback may allow for a refined proposal to pass the Governance process.

Beyond this, Recognized Delegates may take on additional roles and responsibilities as they see fit. 
Examples might include:

* Authoring Governance proposals
* Evaluating proposals in the TEMP CHECK or ARFC stage on the Aave forum
* Participating in calls and discussions centered on issues related to Aave

The community may decide to author future proposals that require a Recognized Delegate to take on additional roles and responsibilities - but these key responsibilities should remain intact.

## Recognized Delegate Resignation [End of Term]

If a Recognized Delegate wishes to step down from their role, they should take steps to ensure that their delegators and the Aave community are informed.

At a minimum, this should include a post in their Delegate Platform thread. We recommend that a team may notify the DAO as early as possible to ensure voting power is transitioned.

## Next Steps

Next steps to ensure a successful framework of recognized delegates:

1. Gather feedback and input from the Aave community on the proposed requirements
2. Incorporate and refine the proposal based on feedback from the community
3. Upgrade and communicate the new requirements to current and new delegates

295,"#### ABSTRACT

This proposal introduces a strategic alliance between Eesee, a gamified NFT platform, and ApeCoin DAO. The partnership is designed to democratize access to high-value NFTs, stimulate community interaction, and inspire active involvement in ApeCoin governance, and enhance the visibility of ApeCoin’s sub-communities.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

The proposed partnership will provide ApeCoin DAO and its sub-communities with the opportunity to tap into Eesee’s growing user base, a demographic that is deeply interested in NFT trading. Additionally, the proposal aims to build a deeper connection between our two communities through exclusive NFT drops, special events, and educational quests.

These quests, inspired by “Coinbase Earn”, will provide engaging and educational content about ApeCoin and its sub-communities. The introduction of educational quests will encourage ApeCoin holders to learn more about the ApeCoin ecosystem, participate in governance, and contribute to the community. Upon completion, users will be rewarded with dynamic NFT badges that not only serve as a token of achievement but also provide access to exclusive content or events.

For instance, these badges could be used for token-gating, where only holders of certain level badges (e.g., Level 3 ApeCoin badge holders) can participate in specific raffles. This mechanism encourages active involvement and learning within the ApeCoin ecosystem, while also bringing attention to the sub-communities.

Also, the quests will include updates from the sub-communities, inspiring participants to interact more actively with these platforms and join their Twitter spaces. This approach will help to democratize access to high-value NFTs, cultivate a more vibrant, engaged community, and increase governance participation.

#### OVERALL COST

As this proposal does not involve a funding request, there is no associated cost to the ApeCoin DAO. The implementation will be carried out by the Eesee team.

Title: [ARFC] Deploy whitelabel Aave V3 Market - Reental 
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-26

---

# **Summary**
The current proposal aims to deploy a “whitelabel” version of Aave V3 for Reental tokens on the Polygon network. By allowing friendly forks of Aave V3, Aave can increase its technology adoption and provide an alternative source of revenue and synergies for the DAO and third-party teams.

### **Motivation**

Reental, in collaboration with Reental Master LLC, a protocol offering utility and functionalities associated with the Real World Assets (RWA) market, aims to deploy its collateralization market (ReenLever) on Aave's V3 platform. Reental stands as a global leader with extensive experience in real estate asset tokenization, having tokenized over $46 million across four countries on three continents. It uniquely combines these security tokens with its own utility token ($RNT), delivering significant benefits to its community of over 16,000 investors.

Reental is a key player in the global tokenization of RWAs, specifically in the real estate market. It offers investment opportunities in real estate assets to users worldwide. Currently, Reental has tokenized over 65 properties across four countries (USA, Spain, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic), totaling $25 million, with a community of 16,000 users from over 80 countries. 

With this track record, Reental stands as the only company worldwide with tokenized properties across four countries on three continents, aspiring to become a global entity with properties tokenized worldwide and partnerships with some of the sector's most prominent corporations: Civitas, Grupo ClerHP, Grupo BEC, M2Capital, Sibarys Capital, and others. 

In addition to its demonstrated traction as a leader in the Spanish-speaking RWA market over the past three years, Reental recently launched its utility token: $RNT. This tool enables the community to actively participate in the protocol, foster mutual growth, and transform user investors into stakeholders, creating a virtuous growth cycle.

### Specification

We are witnessing a highly favorable trend and narrative regarding RWAs, and Aave can maintain its leadership by embracing the unstoppable growth of this ecosystem. Reental can contribute to this growth with its collateralized lending market.

Reental proposes launching a whitelisted Aave V3 instance, bringing along the current $46 million tokenized volume, which could be collateralized immediately, and the potential for billions more in the coming years.

20% of the generated fees will be allocated to the Aave DAO. While the Reental market is not currently a significant business prospect for the Aave DAO, and it is not expected to be a significant revenue driver, the market has an interesting value proposition for off-chain collateral-based liquidity protocols.

This integration bridges the off-chain world with the on-chain realm through these RWAs, which are already yielding returns for investors.

Reental will assume the role of risk admin for this market, adding new properties monthly.

297,"Boba Network is proposing to deploy Aave v3 on the Boba Network L2 to expand lending to a growing community of users and provide incentives to bootstrap the launch of Aave to a new ecosystem.

Paragraph Summary

Our goal is to accelerate Aave's expansion in the multi-chain world. Boba is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup scaling solution that reduces gas fees, improves transaction throughput, and extends the capabilities of smart contracts.

Boba Network invites the Aave community to support this launch by participating in the Aave contracts deployment, enabling the Aave v3
front-end for Boba markets, and adding Boba Network in its recently announced cross-chain governance module roadmap.

Introducing Boba's WAGMI incentive program for builders and developers, in collaboration with UMAprotocol, we will be distributing WAGMI options on $BOBA tokens to bootstrap initial usage of Aave on Boba Network.

WAGMI options are KPI (key performance indicators) options based on metrics relating to Boba Network, such as monthly active wallets or project specific TVL. Traditional liquidity mining programs are zero-sum: users come to collect high rewards and are incentivized to keep those rewards. WAGMI farming turns this model on its head by being positive sum: users are incentivized to evangelize and encourage behaviors that grow Boba.

In addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support.

Our overall goal is to use Boba’s $100 million ecosystem fund for growing a deep base of 1,000 dapps and 1mm+ daily transactions.

Motivation

Aave is already planning to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Boba ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Oolongswap, FRAX, Synapse, Dodo and many other DeFi projects. Aave will be the first major lending protocol on Boba and will add net new users from Boba’s 300,000+ community members. After enabling basic DeFi primitives like AMMs and NFT marketplaces, our community is eagerly awaiting lending markets on Boba.

Specifications

Boba is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup scaling solution that reduces gas fees, improves transaction throughput, and extends the capabilities of smart contracts. Boba offers fast exits backed by community-driven liquidity pools, shrinking the Optimistic Rollup exit period from seven days to only a few minutes, while giving LPs incentivized yield farming opportunities.

Boba’s extensible smart contracts will enable developers across the Ethereum ecosystem to build dApps that invoke code executed on web-scale infrastructure such as AWS Lambda, making it possible to use algorithms that are either too expensive or impossible to execute on-chain.

Boba Network aspires to be the People’s L2 that puts users and developers first. The goal is to build a pragmatic L2 that is the first step towards opening Ethereum to the next Billion users. Boba is an L2 Ethereum scaling & augmenting solution built by the Enya team as core contributors to the OMG Foundation.

Boba has grown to ~$350mm in TVL on mainnet since launch and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible.

298,"## Simple Summary
Gauntlet's risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify liquidation bonus on one (1) Aave V3 AVAX asset without adding outsized market risk.


Additionally, we provide user position analysis below.



## Abstract
These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. 


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

## Aave V3 AVAX Parameter Changes Specification

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at reasonable levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. Our simulations show that the protocol can lower the liquidation bonus for WAVAX on Avalanche Aave v3 without incurring significant additional risk to the protocol.



| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| WAVAX Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 9.2%     |




## Aave V3 AVAX Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V3 AVAX Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aavev3_avax) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V3.

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

299,"## [ARFC-Addendum] Update Boosters for Merit Round 6

## Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)

## Date: 2024-07-03

---

## **Summary**

We propose updating Merit parameters and rewarded actions to increase program efficiency and to reflect latest narratives to continue to boost Aave DAO and Merit for Round 6.

### Motivation

The Aave protocol maintained and developed its market share in DeFi in a highly competitive landscape thanks to the Merit program. Latest rounds of Merit have been a success.

Merit aims to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program, therefore it needs to be updated and adapted when narratives change and new strategies can be applied for future rounds.

wETH supply is key for growth, as it is the biggest revenue source for Aave DAO. wETH is essential for the Aave DAO due to its role in enhancing liquidity, providing collateral, facilitating integrations, and driving user adoption, significantly increasing Aave's revenue through interest income, fees from liquidations, and increased platform usage.

With [**[ARFC] Deploy a Lido Aave v3 Instance**](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-a-lido-aave-v3-instance/18047) being at Snapshot stage, deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on the Lido ecosystem, aiming to support leveraged staking of stETH and wETH, benefiting both Aave and Lido users, it makes sense to align with Merit.

Finally, with **[GHO being launched on Arbitrum](https://avara.xyz/blog/gho-stablecoin-now-live-on-arbitrum)** yesterday, it’s a strategic move to expand into Merit Program rewards for StkGHO to Arbitrum Safety Module if Governance approve its deployment. So for future Merit 6 Round, staking GHO to Arbitrum SM will be a reward action under Merit.

### Specification

**Boosters Update**

- Removal of weETH in the “Diversity supporter” LST boost.
- Removal of OG DAO participant (Booster for early DAO voters or delegates). This boost was meant to support early adopters, after 5 rounds of boost, it’s time to make all users, old and new on equal footing
- Introducing wETH supplier “Eth Maxi” Boost: this will be a Boost for Ethereum and a pre-approval for wETH Arbitrum and Aave Lido markets, in order to incentivize them.

In order to be elegible for the Eth Maxi Boost, a user would need to either supply wETH (have awETH balance) and borrow GHO or stake GHO in order to have aStkGHO balance. this boost also apply to wETH suppliers on Arbitrum market

- Introducing Ahab program to wETH suppliers to the Aave Lido Instance to initiate a Liquidity Mining Program.
- Potentially expand Merit StkGHO to Arbitrum Safety Module if Governance approve its deployment.

Activation of ACI as Emission manager for wETH on Mainnet, Arbitrum & if approved by governance on Aave lido market to implement Liquidity mining programs.

### Next Steps

1. Gather community consensus on this [ARFC Addendum].
2. If there is agreement, escalate this [ARFC-Addendum] proposal to a Snapshot vote for formal approval.
3. If [ARFC Addendum] is approved in Snapshot phase, apply changes to Merit Round 6.

title: [ARFC] TokenLogic - 6 month Service Provider Proposal
author: @TokenLogic
created: 2023-09-07

# Summary

Following a successful [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x05636d75aae6e99be9c79a6337603f69213d34c3cf0b518842aa994f2ec790bf) this publication seeks to onboard TokenLogic as a Service Provider to Aave DAO.

# Motivation

TokenLogic has been contributing to Aave for nearly 6 months and this publication formalises our continued contribution to the Aave ecosystem by onboarding the team as a recognised Service Provider.

This funding will be used to support the TokenLogic team to deliver the scope as outlined in the [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x05636d75aae6e99be9c79a6337603f69213d34c3cf0b518842aa994f2ec790bf).

If the DAO elects to grant an overlapping scope of work to another service provider, TokenLogic will amend the GHO stream accordingly.

If other teams within the Aave ecosystem wish to make proposal on topics TokenLogic is working on, we will proactively work with the team to achieve the best outcome for Aave DAO.

# Specification

The following assets in the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO via the Aave Swap contract.

* [350,000 aethDAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x018008bfb33d285247a21d44e50697654f754e63?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)

The AIP will call the createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController interface to create a 180-day stream for 350,000 units of GHO. The following address will be the recipient of the stream:

Address: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`

This will allow the TokenLogic to periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.

303,"### Simple Summary

Add a disclaimer to the borrower user interface, notifying users that governance can change parameter values which may alter their account health.

### Motivation

The governance process results in parameter changes of numerous kinds, including changes that impact account health factors. For example, the community has recently aligned on a [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding reducing liquidation thresholds. 

One way to increase transparency for Aave users is by adding a disclaimer in the borrow user interface. Since not all users may be aware that there is a governance process to change parameters or of the potential impact of governance decisions, it is valuable to make this information salient. Without this disclaimer, a user might believe that only price fluctuations impact their account health.

### Specification

Below is a mock-up of what the disclaimer would look like. Font size, design, and other details may be adjusted.

#### Content
Attention: Parameter changes via governance can alter your account health factor and risk of liquidation. Follow the Aave governance forum [link] for updates.

Avalanche: Signal for deployment

Summary

The Avalanche Foundation asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into Avalanche.

Proposer

The Avalanche Foundation is dedicated to supporting the Avalanche ecosystem and related technologies. The Foundation is part of a larger Avalanche ecosystem and working with other organizations to support the significant development of Avalanche-related technologies.

Avalanche is one of the fastest smart contracts platforms in the blockchain industry, as measured by time-to-finality, and has the most validators securing its activity of any proof-of-stake protocol. Avalanche’s C-Chain is an instance of the EVM running with Avalanche’s consensus.

Rationale

Current status of the Avalanche C-Chain: The Avalanche network is secured by over 1,000 validators and is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of Avalanche consensus. While maintaining this level of decentralization, the network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 1-2 seconds, making the network’s C-Chain an incredible playground for DeFi and other EVM applications. The ecosystem already has a slew of native projects offering exchange, lending, and aggregation services, over $1.5bn bridged from Ethereum, over $2.2bn in TVL, and protocols such as SushiSwap and Curve deployed or in the process of deploying.

Why it is good for the Aave ecosystem: The Avalanche blockchain is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, and near-instant finality. Through the Avalanche Rush program, the Avalanche foundation has allocated up to $20M AVAX for users of the Aave protocol over a three-month period to earn AVAX rewards while using Aave on Avalanche for the first phase of the program. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established Avalanche community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on established chains like Avalanche will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.

Why signaling is necessary? Consistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, he Avalanche Foundation believes that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on – and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. The Avalanche Rush announcement received a lot of interest from both the Aave and Avalanche communities. Deploying the Aave protocol on Avalanche will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.

Next Steps

Creation of Snapshot vote for the Aave community to signal YES/NO for deployment on Avalanche.

##### ABSTRACT
1. $75K for 2.5% equity to the DAO = $3M Valuation
2. 10,000 DAO Dark Lager free for $APE holders
3. +10,000 Cans of Beer for 10 Communities irl events (10 $APE holder independent panel who will decide which events get the beer) + Feld, Quit, Pieter, David & Gene
* We have brewing capacity and the ability to deliver to events in Asia, UK, Canada, and the US
4. $APE Gamified Educational Platform
5. Boring Brewery Clubhouse/Taproom IRL in 2024
6. Otherside and others (such as Faraway) Assets for Yuga Labs Gaming


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
1. We will work with the DAO and legal to give 2.5% equity to the DAO. This first of its kind give back will usher in the next wave of AIP’s and set the stage for true value creation within the DAO amplified by the marketing impact through branding, education and culture driven social content and sharing. By taking this on, Bored Brewing will lay the difficult, but exciting groundwork for giving back to the DAO.
2. We will be spreading knowledge about $APE to less crypto native people who enjoy drinking beer. We believe that $APE can become a currency for the digital revolution and we want to be a small part of spreading the name to a demographic thirsty for this type of knowledge outside of the crypto community.
3. We will sponsor partnered events and share the ApeCoin brand across other relevant crypto/nft communities. The goal is to market the coin and share the background and goals of the DAO for the future.


##### OVERALL COST 
149,696 $APE

- Approx 50K $APE - $75K USD in exchange for 2.5% equity utilizing the SAFE agreement mentioned above.

- 40K $APE for 20,000 (approx $3/can including shipping) Cans of Beer. Designed, recipe developed, partnered with, produced and project managed to deliver Globally.

- 10K $APE towards skins and assets for Metaverse, Gaming, and ODK activations.

- 15K $APE towards software development, design, testing, and deployment of the $APE gamified educational platform for ApeCoin (<50% of the total cost/budget).

- 20K $APE towards the IRL Clubhouse/Taproom build out (<25% of the total budget).

- 5K $APE for technology integration and distribution setup for direct to consumer shipping

- 9,696 $APE for marketing, comms, project management, and graphic design/assets for promotion of each activation and partnership as well as content creation for each of the deliverables.

312,"# Purpose

This proposal seeks approval to begin the Uniswap Liquidity Program v0.1 to migrate liquidity to v3. A detailed proposal on the Uniswap Liquidity Program can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-begin-uniswap-liquidity-program-v0-1/13635).

# Summary

This proposal outlines a framework for establishing a liquidity incentives program (Uniswap Liquidity Program, ULP) with the goals of: accelerating the migration of liquidity to Uniswap v3; encouraging new market participants to experiment with liquidity provision, further distributing ownership of UNI tokens, and supporting ecosystem growth over the long-term.

We propose the program start with an initial maximum budget of 1.662m UNI, to be allocated as liquidity incentives across two quarters. Continuation of the program will require an additional governance vote. Upon renewal of the program, each of the three initiatives can be broken out into separate proposals.

The program will aim to bootstrap liquidity across three different initiatives:

* Stablecoin pairs
* Mid-tail pairs (e.g DeFi governance tokens)
* Deposit receipt tokens (i.e. cTokens, aTokens)

Note that this is just the beginning of the Uniswap Liquidity Program (v0.1). We want to start simple and evaluate the program's effectiveness before we expand it. We will provide periodic updates on ULP to Uniswap governance and seek community feedback.

Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative

Date: 2023-04-04

## **Summary**:

This ARFC proposes the deployment of Aave V3 on the BNB Chain, expanding Aave's presence and tapping into the growing DeFi ecosystem and user base of BNB Chain.

## **Abstract**:

Upon approval by the Aave community, Aave V3 will be deployed on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT. This deployment aims to enhance the growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities, providing new opportunities for both ecosystems.

## **Motivation**:

Deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain presents potential benefits for both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and potential additional revenue. In return, BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.

## **Specification**:

The ARFC suggests deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with the following assets for collateral: CAKE, BNB, BTCB, WETH, USDC, and USDT. The table below provides the suggested risk parameters for each asset.

Yes = In favor of increasing the supply cap for BTC.b by 100%
No = Against increasing the supply cap for BTC.b by 100%

This proposal follows the fast-track process for increasing supply & borrow caps. Link to the governance post: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-increase-supply-cap-for-btc-b-on-avalanche-v3-fast-track/10068

Here are the current parameters for BTC.b on Avalanche V3:

Loan-to-value: 70.00%
Liquidation threshold: 75.00%
Liquidation penalty: 6.50%
Supply cap: 2,900 BTC.b ($56.6M)
Total supply: 2,270 BTC.b ($44.3M, 78% of the pool at current supply cap)


Deposits and withdrawals for BTC.b on Avalanche V3 have only been live for a few days and it is already close to hitting its supply cap, indicating a very high growth of this market that we expect to continue in the future. We believe that increasing the supply-cap to 5,800 BTC.b will be necessary to accommodate the increasing market demand for supplying BTC.b.

BTC.b can be directly minted and redeemed with BTC in a permissionless and non-custodial manner through the Avalanche Bridge (more details in the listing proposal). There is still $43M worth of WBTC.e supplied on the Avalanche V3 market that we expect to migrate to BTC.b given that it is a safer version of the same asset, quickly establishing itself as the default on Avalanche.

We’re very excited to see the growing adoption of BTC.b and look forward to discussing this proposal with the community.",neutral

## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.

These parameter recommendations reflect the unique situation of REN in the current market conditions.  

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **REN Liquidation Threshold**     | 65%     | ***60%***     |
| **REN Loan To Value**     | 60%     | ***55%***     |



## Notable Accounts to Flag

As of 11/16/2022, the data shows that only one dust account, `0x0e1337ea2c604f9a937d2623af206cdd02167b38` would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This account has a total of ~$100 in supply.

This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on this forum post.



## Risk Dashboard

The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

318,"## Goal of the vote

0x Labs would like to gather signal from the community on whether or not there is support for on-chain governance as proposed in [ZEIP-95](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/95).

## Scope

The forum discussion on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-95-migrating-0x-protocol-to-on-chain-governance-process/3513](https://gov.0x.org/t/zeip-95-migrating-0x-protocol-to-on-chain-governance-process/3513)

As described in the forum discussion, there would be a three-step process to the full transition to a new governance mechanism:

1. Deployment of the new governance smart contracts for initial calibration and testing
2. Migration period: ZRX holders can start registering to the new system
3. Vote to switch governance systems: 0x is fully controlled by new smart contracts

This snapshot vote will only give signal on the community’s sentiment with step 1. 

If sentiment is favorable, 0x Labs will continue to develop and deploy the system of smart contracts that define a new governance mechanism — the technical implementation can be found open sourced [here](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/issues/95).

A subsequent vote (ZEIP-95) will be required to officially switch ownership of the `exchangeProxy` contract to a new governance mechanism, completing the transition.

#### **Fundraising:**

- Zero is actively raising capital and BADGER will get 30 cents on every $1 of future pre-TGE fundraising. For example, a $5m raise will result in $1.5m to Badger.
- Any proposed raise below a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $30m require pre-Approval from Badger

#### **Badger Investment:**

- The $500k Badger / DIGG token commitment from BIP 50 is forgiven and Badger keeps the tokens
- Badger gives up the discounted 5% post-TGE options
- Badger stake in ZERO is reduced from 20% to 12%

#### **TGE:**

- At the TGE, Badger will receive it’s full 12% stake
- Use of these tokens will be determined by a vote from the Badger Council and Badger Treasury in consultation with ZERO team representatives

#### **Reporting:**

- The Badger Treasury Council will update the community quarterly on the status of Zero fundraising and each time capital is returned to Badger

# Paragraph summary
We would like to ask for your support in listing RSR (Reserve Rights Token) as an asset to borrow. RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both (a) insures and (b) governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol.

# Motivation
The Reserve team is launching the Reserve protocol in fall of 2022. From that point on, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token will serve the purpose of (a) insuring and (b) governing stablecoins created on the Reserve protocol (RTokens).

The Reserve protocol [GitHub - reserve-protocol/protocol](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/) is building on Aave by (a) integrating aTokens as collateral and (b) using the protocol oracle to determine price during valuation and auction functions (if listed on Aave as borrowable asset).

We would prefer to use the Aave oracles for the simplicity of our protocol’s design and the code has already been included in our ongoing audit. To do so, this requires RSR to be a borrowable asset on Aave.

When RSR is staked on a particular Reserve stablecoin (RToken), it may receive a portion of income from the respective RToken’s full collateral basket. Because of this, we anticipate demand to borrow RSR in order to stake or hedge staked positions. Aave would be the only platform where this would be possible as of now.

# Specifications
## Link between the author & the project: 
The Reserve team
## High level overview of the project: 
The mission of the Reserve project is to help people cope with the effects of high- or hyperinflation and aims to eventually eradicate it. The project does this by developing (a) stable+(**) cryptocurrencies, (b) a mobile application to exchange local currencies with the stable+ cryptocurrencies and (c) a protocol that insures & governs them.
 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiaxl7iig3h3eceftb6qulbqugv52vmwndiv6da44y7zb6lrre6ole)
The Reserve app is currently available in Latin American countries where hyperinflation has had the most significant impact: Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia & Panama. It currently has >600,000 registered users and ~120,000 weekly app visitors who use the Reserve stablecoin(s) for daily purchases such as paying for groceries, paying bills, etc. This video shows how some of our customers use our stablecoin daily (https://tinyurl.com/mudrhh4d).

The Reserve Rights (RSR) token is the governance token used to insure the stable+ cryptocurrencies against collateral defaults, and while staked, is also used to govern the RTokens (collateral changes, etc).

A key point is that when RSR is staked on a particular RToken, it will typically (% determined by governance) receive a portion of the income of the entire RToken’s collateral.

(**) We define an asset as stable+ if it never depreciates, and generally appreciates over time, relative to its backing asset(s).

## Why would RSR be a good borrow asset?
We anticipate that the yield on stRSR will drive demand to borrow RSR for two primary purposes: (a) to hedge against price changes on an existing stRSR position and (b) to borrow with intent to stake for the stRSR yield.

These are both well known strategies in DeFi and TradFi, and we don’t expect that to be any different with RSR. Furthermore, we have received a significant amount of requests from our community, but have delayed on making this request until we were closer to launching our platform.

Aave would be the first and currently, only, place to borrow RSR in DeFi and as a result, we anticipate there to be demand.

By listing RSR as a borrowable asset, Aave would become the first DeFi protocol that allows borrowing RSR and could therefore benefit from the borrowing demand from the RSR community and potentially other parties.

## Brief history of the project’s components
The main relevant components of the Reserve ecosystem are the Reserve mobile app and the Reserve Protocol.

The Reserve app has been fully open access to users in the aforementioned countries since September 2021. The full version of the Reserve protocol will be live sometime in 2022. We anticipate this happening in the early Fall, although as with all development work, this could be a bit sooner or later.

An initial concept of fully collateralized stablecoins was launched in 2019, and since then the team has been working on the fully decentralized and permissionless platform that will allow for the creation of fully collateralized, yield bearing, and insured stablecoins. Full details on this updated version can be found here: [Protocol description - Reserve](https://reserve.org/protocol/2021_version/).

## How is the asset currently used?
At this point in time the Reserve Rights (RSR) token serves as a placeholder token. From this year onward, the token will be used for two main purposes:
1. RSR holders can stake their RSR on any Reserve stablecoin (RToken) to insure it against default of one of the collateral tokens and in return, may receive a portion of the yield generated by the collateral backing RTokens.
2. RSR holders can govern Reserve stablecoin to help decide on its future (e.g. collateral assets, back-up assets, locking periods, etc).
## Emission schedule
The total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens, out of which there are currently 18.3b in circulation. The remaining 81.7b RSR tokens are locked. Out of these, 49.4b tokens belong to the Slow Wallet, 15.5b to seed investors and strategic partners and 16.8b to team members and advisors.

The [Slow Wallet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70?a=0x6bab6EB87Aa5a1e4A8310C73bDAAA8A5dAAd81C1) is a locked wallet controlled by the Reserve project, used to fund RToken adoption initiatives like listings, partnerships, marketing, etc. It’s under the discretionary control of the Reserve team. However, it has a hard-coded 4-week delay after initiating each withdrawal transaction on the blockchain. Upon initiating a withdrawal transaction, the team announces the purpose of the withdrawal either through a public on-chain message or on social media. If RSR holders do not agree with the purpose of the withdrawal, they are able to sell their RSR in the 4-week period before the project is able to sell what they have withdrawn. The team can only access these withdrawn tokens after those 4 weeks.

More details here: [Release schedule](https://reserve.org/protocol/rsr_release_schedule/#main-content)

## Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?
The total supply of RSR cannot be changed. RSR did migrate from a V1 contract in the past, and some RSR has not completed the migration yet. The only minting that occurs is from migration (which does not impact total supply).

The contract is un-upgradeable, however it is pausable. The pauser is set to the [Reserve team multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xA7b123D54BcEc14b4206dAb796982a6d5aaA6770/home), a 3-of-5 safe. Pausing will only be done in situations where the token or platform is in danger. Once the platform has reached steady state, the team intends to release pausing to a burn address.

326,"## Title: [ARFC] Increase GHO Borrow Rate
## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative
## Date: 2023-08-23
---


## Summary

This ARFC proposes an increase in the borrow rate of GHO from the current rate of 1.5% to 2.5%. The aim is to address the peg deviation of GHO and ensure its growth and trustworthiness in the market.


## Motivation

GHO has witnessed a rapid growth, reaching a circulating supply of 22M in just a few weeks since its launch. One of the primary reasons for this growth, especially in the current adverse market conditions, is the GHO borrow rate set below the market price of stablecoin borrows. This low rate, combined with the current lack of holding venues and the inability to use GHO as collateral, has made single-side liquidity provision in stableswaps, such as Balancer pools, [one of the most sought-after strategies.](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity)

While deep liquidity and growth are desired as a go-to-market strategy for GHO, the peg deviation of GHO (currently around $0.975) is affecting its growth and trust in the market. A consensus short-term solution to this issue is to slightly raise the GHO borrow rate from 1.5% to 2.5%. This rate remains attractive for borrowers and is still below the market average rates. However, by reducing the discount, it is anticipated to have a positive effect.

This proposal is particularly relevant in the context of the potential [sDAI onboarding integration](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sdai-aave-v3-onboarding/14410). This integration is expected to add short-term sell pressure on GHO, especially with the current borrow rate, which could further harm the GHO peg.

The discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.

## Specification

- **Asset**: GHO
- **Contract Address**: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f
- **Current Borrow Rate**: 1.5%
- **Proposed Borrow Rate**: 2.5%
- **New discounted Borrow Rate**: ~1.75%

## Disclamer

The Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this TEMP CHECK.

## Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.
3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, implement the proposed changes to the GHO borrow rate.

328,"## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust three (3) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across two (2) Aave V3 Optimism assets.

## Motivation

Chaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. 

Please find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).

*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*

You can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).

The output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to reduce the LP for WBTC, and increase LT and LTV for wstETH on V3 Optimism, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a negligible effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)

**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$130K, with negligible impact on Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**

### Liquidity Analysis:

Based on our analysis, we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support any significant liquidations with the updated parameters.

### Positions Analysis

We have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations.

### Recommendations

| Asset | Parameter | Current | Rec | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WBTC | Liquidation Penalty | 8.5% | 7.5% | -1% |
| wstETH | Liquidation Threshold | 79% | 80% | +1% |
| wstETH | Loan-to-Value | 70% | 71% | +1% |",neutral

330,"This proposal whitelists the Apollo Vault addresses for OSMO/WBTC and OSMO/WETH for ForceUnlocking, enabling liquidation events to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within.

What are Vaults?
Vaults are a key piece of infrastructure required to enable leveraged yield farming on Osmosis.

Vaults allow users to deposit tokens to be managed by a protocol and enable access to yield strategies offered by that protocol.

Leveraged Liquidity Positions require depositing assets into a vault which then provides liquidity on a user's behalf. These assets may then be used as collateral via Mars' Rover Credit Accounts to increase the value of the liquidity provided. The vault also auto-compounds rewards into the pool to maximise yield.

In the event of the pool's value dropping below a declared safety threshold and the position being liquidated, the collateralised assets within the vault are required to be automatically sold. As these assets will be locked in order to receive liquidity incentives this is not possible without allowing the vault addresses to directly bypass this restriction and unlock assets immediately rather than waiting for the bonding period to pass.

Apollo LP Vaults have been audited by Oak Security and the audit report can be found here.

Implementation
This proposal directly whitelists the address to be able to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within them, enabling the liquidation of over-leveraged deposits.

## title: [ARFC] ACI Phase II
author: @marczeller - Aave-chan Initiative
date: 2023-10-17

---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the continuation of the collaboration with the Aave-chan Initiative (ACI) for an additional period of 180 days, with a proposed budget of 375k GHO.

## Motivation

![image|1920x1097, 50%](upload://9xBM448LftJoHXyBmCPgIOHzLd7.jpeg)


The ACI has demonstrated significant value to the Aave ecosystem across multiple fronts. This proposal seeks to extend our collaboration, focusing on three primary axes: Skyward, Growth, and Representation.

### Skyward:

![image|2000x559](upload://22rgZUXRYxc6uOrlNotwo8BiZ6l.png)


Skyward has emerged as a cornerstone of Aave's governance, producing 90 AIPs in 180 days. This averages out to **[one AIP every other day](https://dune.com/alice_rozengarden/aip-creation-in-2023)**, a testament to the relentless dedication and efficiency of the ACI. Beyond numbers, the ACI has fostered a spirit of collaboration within the Aave ecosystem.

We've co-authored proposals with the vast majority of active DAO service providers, recognized delegates and some active community members. Moreover, our doors have always been open to third-party protocols. By actively welcoming and collaborating with them, we've streamlined the governance process, ensuring that Aave remains inclusive and cohesive in its approach.

**What to expect for phase II?**

Continuation & extension of the Skyward services.

### Growth:

![image|2000x1088](upload://qjlOWocj80wUPeSHio06wG9yJBp.jpeg)


The ACI operates under a guiding principle of ""**Continuous incremental improvement.**""

While we acknowledge that we might not be the driving force behind tech breakthroughs like a potential Aave V4 or, recently, the Governance V3 AIP, our daily commitment is unwavering. We aim to make the protocol 1% better every single day, one AIP at a time. It's through these consistent, small steps that we believe Aave can maintain its leadership in the DeFi space.

Our efforts have already borne fruit. The implementation of offboarding plans for assets like BUSD & TUSD stands out. These initiatives not only enhanced protocol safety but also turned a profit, generating close to 1M$ for the DAO. This revenue, in itself, has multiple times repaid the investment made in the ACI. Furthermore, our vigilant oversight of the DAO's finances has ensured efficiency. We've curbed overspending, optimized budgets, and deterred proposals that didn't align with Aave's best interests, saving the DAO a 7-figure amount & ensuring every GHO & DAO $ is well spent.

**What to expect for phase II?**

The ACI will continue to focus on our continuous incremental improvement doctrine, being a driving force in Aave protocol growth and BD.

For Phase II the main focal points will be on Liquid Staking Tokens diversity with the support of onboarding new assets, GHO growth and adoption with support of synergies and the integration of GHO in both onchain protocols, ramps & L2s.

### Representation:

The ACI has actively engaged in both internal and external representation for the Aave DAO.

**Internal Representation**:

Prior to the ACI's involvement, the DAO too often encountered challenges, such as proposals not reaching the required quorum. Governance activity was subdued, and the operations were notably insular. The ACI introduced several key initiatives:

- **Orbit Program**: The ACI allocated ~20% of its budget to the Orbit program, focusing on diversity. This program compensates recognized delegates for their contributions, leading to increased participation rates and improved diversity metrics. The frequency of proposals failing due to a lack of quorum has decreased. With the now DAO-funded Orbit program, **the DAO has enshrined these benefits**
- **Governance Guidelines**: The ACI contributed to the establishment of the Aave DAO governance guidelines. This effort aimed to bring clarity, predictability, and efficiency to DAO governance. The ""**Minimal Viable Bureaucracy**"" ACI Doctrine, ensures a balance between structured governance and accessibility.
- **Support for New Delegates**: The ACI has extended support to emerging delegate platforms, co-authoring proposals and providing guidance. This collaborative approach has enriched the DAO's ecosystem.

**What to Expect from Phase II?**

We will continue contributing to the Aave DAO frameworks and supporting DAO active participants seeking a balance between organization & accessibility.

We will also delegate engineering resources for service providers via mini-dapps such as the recent [acistreamcollector.com](http://acistreamcollector.com), which allows no code claims of DAO streams.

**External Representation**:

![image|1920x1423](upload://o68ggEFjWsJdbQHaC8hqxPvL6sV.jpeg)


Externally, the ACI has been a voice for the Aave DAO in various capacities.

- **Event Participation**: The ACI has participated in and sponsored several global events to share insights and collaborate with industry peers. In 2023, our engagements included:
    - Web3DNA (Paris)
    - EthDubai 2023
    - Prague DeFi Summit/EthPrague
    - Stable Summit (Paris)
    - EthCC[6] (Paris)
    - Dappcon Berlin 2023
    - LëtzStake (Luxembourg)
    - EthLisbon
    - Devconnect Istanbul
    
    A detailed list of our engagements can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/f676c1ce96f44c648ef2a40f7f1bb442?pvs=21).
    
- **Regulatory Engagement**: The ACI's founder holds the position of president of the DeFi committee of the French Lobby ADAN. This role involves dialogues with regulators, institutions, and governments in France and Europe regarding the DeFi sector. The ACI has been involved in discussions related to the ""Mica 2"" regulation, which addresses DeFi services.

The ACI, as one of the voices for the Aave DAO, has consistently worked towards enhancing the DAO's presence and reputation in the broader ecosystem.

**What to Expect from Phase II?**

The ACI will continue to be one of the voices of Aave across the globe, supporting devs in hackathons, being one of the DAO voices during events and supporting our brand quality.

title: [ARFC] Aave Swap Upgrade
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @defiJesus & @efecarranza 
created: 2023-11-02

---

# Summary

Ths publication proposes that the Aave DAO engages TokenLogic to upgrade the Aave Swap Contract to include Limit Orders and TWAP swap functionality.

# Motivation

The intial iteration of the Aave Swap contract includes the functionality to swap one asset for another within a pre-defined variance relative to Chainlink Oracle(s). ie: Chainlink Oracle +/- 50bps slippage including gas cost. 

In recent proposals, the DAO has committed to using the Cowswap TWAP functionality to acquire AURA. This highlights a functionality gap on the Aave Swap contract. This publication proposes upgrading the swap contract to include TWAP functionality. The TWAP feature is to use the new Composable COW (Composable Conditional Orders). An example is shown below:

Alice wants to sell 12,000,000 DAI for at least 7500 WETH. She wants to do this using a TWAP, executing a part each day over a period of 30 days.

`sellToken` = DAI
`buytoken` = WETH
`receiver` = address(0)
`partSellAmount` = 12000000 / 30 = 400000 DAI
`minPartLimit` = 7500 / 30 = 250 WETH
`t0` = Nominated start time (unix epoch seconds)
`n` = 30 (number of parts)
`t` = 86400 (duration of each part, in seconds)
`span` = 0 (duration of span, in seconds, or 0 for entire interval)

If Alice also wanted to restrict the duration in which each part traded in each day, she may set span to a non-zero duration. For example, if Alice wanted to execute the TWAP, each day for 30 days, however only wanted to trade for the first 12 hours of each day, she would set span to 43200 (ie. 60 * 60 * 12). Using span allows for use cases such as weekend or week-day only trading.

Whilst integration the TWAP functionality, this publication proposes adding Limit Order functionality. The lift to do so is minimal and it offers additional functionality. Limit Orders enable the DAO to swap one asset for a minimum amount of the received asset. ie: Swap 1 ETH for a minimum 1700 USDC. 

To support the developers using the Aave Swap contract, this publication proposes creating a command-line interface (CLI) using Tenderly to verify if the swaps can be executed at prevailing market conditions. This tool serves the dual purpose of ascertaining the feasibility of a swap and help the developer to determine the appropriate slippage percentage to use.

Slippage in the context of COW Swap does not mean that it will be that number, COW Swap matches orders on a best case basis and the actual cost of the full transaction could be lower. The slippage mentioned here is a worst case scenario that takes into account both the counter-party's price as well as gas costs. Slippage as commonly known could be 0.1% and 0.9% could be gas costs depending on the network utilization at the time of the swap, assuming a 1% slippage. Even allowing for 1% slippage, once executed, the total gas costs + real slippage might end up only being 0.5%.

# Specification

## TWAP Orders

Using Composable Cow upgrade the Aave Swap contract to perform TWAP swaps.

The details on Composable Cow can be found [here](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow).

This upgrade involves adding a Payload template and tests cases.

## Limit Orders

Using the new price checker introduced by Milkman, upgrade the Aave Swap contract to perform limit order swap. 

This upgrade involves adding a Payload template and tests cases.

## Tenderly

Create a CLI tool that uses Tenderly to proactively verify the feasibility of proposed swaps.

This tool offers an approximate assessment of whether a trade with the specified parameters is attainable. It will return `true` for a swap that is likely to succeed and `false` if not likely to succeed. If not likely, then the user can check with a bigger slippage tolerance.

Could also extend it to suggest a slippage given the size of the order and market conditions. 

We want to again reiterate that because of the nature of DAO governance, once the payload is executed, conditions might have changed so we always recommend extending a bit the MAX allowed slippage to account for this.

# Funding

To facilitate the development, this publication seeks the following funding:

**Funding Amount:** $12,672.00 USD, to be paid in GHO.
**Delivery Schedule:** 5 weeks, which includes an estimated 2wk review period.

As part of our normal process, we intend to submit our work to @bgdlabs for review. We do this to ensure our work is of the highest quality.

The transfer of funds will occur with an AIP submission upon successfully completing the scope. 

The Aave DAO is encouraged to vote on one of the following three options:

1) YAE
2) NAE
3) ABSTAIN

# Next Steps

1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will commence building the contracts.
3) Upon delivering the scope, TokenLogic will submit a AIP to create an allowance or transfer for equivalent 12,672.00 USD settled in GHO.

The DAO is expected to uphold outcome of the Snapshot vote.

Deploy Aave V3 on the EVM-compliant L1 network Fantom Opera.

### Proposer

Michael Kong is the CEO/CIO of the Fantom Foundation, a core contributor to Fantom, and a long time Aave supporter.

### Abstract

The Fantom Foundation is at the Aave community's disposal to help facilitate a deployment of Aave V3 on Fantom, an EVM compatible L1 chain with the [6th largest TVL according to DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/chains).

### Motivation

This proposal follows up on the original [Fantom Launch thread](https://governance.aave.com/t/launch-aave-on-fantom/5868) on Aave Governance which received [99.74% support](https://snapshot.org/#/fantomecosystem.eth/proposal/QmSTMpJq4Hbzhd7GifqNUMQTSrW1nbhnFJ88pzRDhu3fB5) from the Fantom community.

Fantom has over $7bn TVL and is host of popular DeFi applications originating from Ethereum such as Curve, Yearn, and Abracadabra, in addition to homegrown apps such as SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, and BeethovenX.

The network TVL is growing fast, having had $5bn in October 2021, and a mere $0.14Bn a year ago.

The Fantom native token FTM is listed on major exchanges, has a Market Cap of $7.6bn, and a combined 24h Volume of $2.1bn [according to CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/fantom/).

### Implementation

* Fantom supports multi-sig, subgraphs, chainlink and band oracles, among other common infrastructure, making a launch seamless.
* Upon launch, Aave would most likely be eligible for the [Fantom Incentive program](https://fantom.foundation/blog/fantom-incentive-program-how-to-apply/), where projects may receive **up to 6,000,000 FTM** vested monthly.
* The Fantom Foundation offers its team of engineers to help with any integration and infrastructure challenges or questions as they may arise.

336,"#### ABSTRACT

TL;DR - ApeCoin DAO needs professional Marketing, PR & Communications. This charter details what an initial infrastructure could/should entail, provides foundational branding support & IP usage guidelines, and creates an environment for the majority of initiatives to spring forth from the community.

The goal of this proposal is to help establish the ApeCoin DAO Marketing and Communications Working Group. The Marketing and Communications Working Group’s mandate is to:

“Propose a consistent and compelling brand strategy and identity for the ApeCoin DAO, propose and implement comprehensive marketing and communications strategies, and help establish a strong presence through effective global communication efforts in order to onboard more users into the DAO.”

Working Groups enable a sustainable community-led infrastructure that further decentralizes the DAO, creates operational efficiency, and is flexible enough to adapt to any opportunities that may arise. The guidelines for how this Working Group will function are proposed in AIP-239.

#### OVERALL COST

$0
* This AIP serves as an initial framework to establish this Working Group. The three elected Stewards will propose a budget 1-3 weeks after being onboarded.

#### PROPOSAL

Link to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-246-working-group-charter-marketing-communications/11837

*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",bullish

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V2 ETH.

## Abstract

Many interest rate curves on Aave have not changed for a long time and, in the case of some assets, have never been updated for the lifetime of the asset listing. Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet has evaluated assets on Aave and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. 


## Motivation

Among other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve:

1. mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool
2. build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future

This proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard GUSD in isolation mode to the Ethereum Aave V3 Market.

# Motivation

As part of the community efforts on the V2 to V3 migration, Chaos Labs proposed a [multi-phased plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636) to promote V3 adoption. As per this plan, Chaos Labs proposes to list GUSD on Aave V3 on Ethereum. GUSD is currently listed on V2 Ethereum as a non-collateral asset.

## Liquidity and Market Cap

When analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at data from the past 180 days. The average market cap of GUSD over the past 180 days was ~$527M, and the average daily trading volume was ~$1M (CeFi & DeFi). 

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreig3i5tpyiqm7khg4n6aydyq7vbyxstf5jjbxgkmzvqmenpr2kcig4)
    

## **Liquidation Threshold**

Analyzing GUSD price volatility over the past, we observed daily annualized volatility of 5.13% and 30-day annualized volatility of 2.38%. Considering this volatility and the history of GUSD on other networks, we recommend an initial LT of 75%.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreid5fugl7ekjkzjhkqinwcacz6d3dtg4xet5lqjd3anfqus6yzyabu)
    

We recommend listing GUSD as borrowable, as we do not observe a significant risk to the protocol by allowing to borrow of GUSD, as long as it is bound by a well-defined cap.

## **Debt Ceiling**

Following [Chaos Labs’ Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440), we recommend an initial debt ceiling of $3.5M. Under the methodology for Isolation Mode, we consider two levels of probabilities for extreme price drops - Medium-High and High. We estimate the probability of an extreme price drop for GUSD as Medium-High. Given this debt ceiling, we do not identify a profitable attack vector under the current liquidity levels.

## **Supply Cap, Borrow Cap, and Liquidation Bonus**

When evaluating the initial supply caps for migrated assets from Aave V2 Market, we carefully analyze the latest supply for the asset and consider it as the demand for supplying the asset. We then ensure that this amount is aligned with the current liquidity on-chain. 

Furthermore, we take into account the debt ceiling calculated using our methodology and derive a supply cap that aligns with the debt ceiling. This approach is aimed at minimizing the risks associated with listing assets while ensuring that the supply cap is aligned with the overall liquidity of the platform and the potential risks that the asset might pose to the protocol.

Accordingly, We recommend a supply cap of 5M GUSD, and a borrow cap of 4M GUSD.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreidosn43yn65cigdxvfbcaepq7mrgnq7lqnc2feazxocchdd7go3ei)
    

Given the concentrated liquidity of GUSD we recommend a 5% Liquidation Bonus.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreibp7fbiom3mgd6oku5zozp2hwlordd57ogxl3fnivvww5hs7kstwi)
    

For the **Reserve Factor**, **Liquidation Protocol Fee**, and **Interest Rate curves**, we recommend aligning the parameters to the other stablecoins currently on Ethereum V3.

## Simple Summary
A proposal to reduce the liquidation bonus for eleven (11) Aave V2 assets.

## Abstract 

This proposal is an extension on the previous [ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-liquidation-bonus-updates/5300) for liquidation bonus updates and the corresponding [AIP-34: Liquidation Bonus Updates](https://app.aave.com/governance/30-QmccRszk94JUyj3xGcBUxUzCo43jZDQYgesEULsudVjm9v) that followed. Besides reserve factor changes, no risk parameter values have been updated since the launch of Aave V2. Gauntlet's simulations output initially targeted liquidation bonus values lower than we recommended. Over the past 10 days we have been able to monitor liquidator behavior and have reached higher confidence in further reductions. 

## Motivation 

The updated liquidation bonuses fared very well since AIP execution on 2021-09-04. The liquidation bonus changes impacted about $7M USD worth of liquidations across 21 users. Despite small changes, a bit over $100k USD was saved for those users (mostly in WBTC and SUSHI). Additionally, no additional insolvencies were recorded after the 18% one day drop in ETH price.

title: [ARFC] sDAI Onboarding on Aave V3 Gnosis Pool
author: @marczeller - Aave-chan Initiative
date: 09-10-2023
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain Pool. With the imminent deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain and the recent deployment of sDAI, we believe this integration will further enhance the utility and liquidity of the Aave ecosystem on Gnosischain.

## Motivation

- **Aave V3 Gnosischain Deployment**: The deployment of Aave V3 on Gnosischain is on the horizon. As outlined in the [Gnosischain deployment ARFC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-deployment-on-gnosischain/14695), sDAI was identified as a prime collateral candidate for Aave. However, at the time of the proposal's creation, sDAI had not been deployed.
  
- **Rapid Growth of sDAI**: Since its deployment, sDAI has shown significant traction, attracting $46M in just a few days. This demonstrates the community's trust and the potential of sDAI as a collateral asset in the Aave ecosystem.
  
- **Technical & Timeframe Considerations**: We propose the onboarding of sDAI into the Aave V3 Gnosischain deployment, either as part of the initial deployment or through a subsequent onboarding AIP, depending on what's most optimal from both a technical and timeframe perspective.

## Specification

- **Asset**: sDAI
- **Contract Address**: 0xaf204776c7245bF4147c2612BF6e5972Ee483701

A Price sync adapter oracle considering both wxDAI value and sDAI exchange rate will be implemented as a Price feed for this asset.

### Risk Parameters

sDAI is intended to serve as a collateral asset. Given that there's minimal value in borrowing it, we propose its onboarding solely as a collateral asset, without borrowing capabilities.

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Add to rETH Holding
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & @DefiJesus + ACI - @MarcZeller 
created: 2023-10-14

---

# Summary

This publication proposes acquiring rETH with ETH held in the DAO's Ethereum Treasury.

# Abstract

This publication proposes converting a portion of the wETH, awETH and wEthWETH held in the Treasury to rETH.

A balance of 100 aEthWETH will remain in the Treasury to facilitate on going DAO expenses such as the [Quarterly Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680) and any other future expense that arise.

# Motivation

At the time of writing the Aave DAO has the following assets in the Ethereum Treasury:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 14.56 |22,543.32|
|awETH|530.39|820,829.60|
|aEthWETH|510.45 | 789,962.05|

The following assets are available to be claimed from the Paraswap Legacy Fees and Fee Claimer contract:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 4.53 |7,011.99|
|wETH| 10.8 |16,717.32|

This publication proposes converting all wETH, awETH and all but 100 aEthWETH to rETH. The 100 aEthWETH is to remain to support on going DAO funding. 

The table below shows the yield differential between the various assets:

|Asset|Yield (%)| 
| --- | --- | 
|wETH| 0.00|
|awETH|1.26|
|aEthWETH|1.97 |
|rETH|3.07|

Based upon current market conditions, the additional yield generated by converting the assets as outlined to rETH is $23,266.50. 

Upon implementation of this [ARFC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-aave-v3-eth-pool-weth-parameters/15110), the additional yield generated is ~$654.42, for the conservative and ~$2,782.86, for the aggressive approach due to the reduction in deposit rates of approximately 10.3 bps and 33.5bps respectively. This does not take into consideration how the market will then adjust after the ETH v3 interst rate parameters are changed. 

# Specification

The following is to be performed:

* Deposit all wETH into aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH)
* Withdraw all awETH (Aave V2 wETH) into ETH
* Withdraw all but 100 aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH) into ETH
* Deposit ETH into RocketPool's rETH
* Transfer rETH into collector

348,"### Summary:

Dear Uniswap community,

About a week ago we (the Blockchain at Michigan in partnership with the [Celo Foundation](https://celo.org/) and the [Celo Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/)) submitted a proposal to deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo to launch “Green Asset” Liquidity Pools and expand access to Uniswap to the 6B smartphone users around the world.

We initiated the [Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x4fdc5d5c87669d3c99072541e1c775f8dee9b906241b2ce22203737b608c8e55) on Snapshot, where the proposal received strong support from the Uniswap community. 12M UNI (~100%) voted yes for the proposal.

We’re excited to initiate the Consensus Check phase. We’d love to receive your support in this proposal.

NOTE: Based on community feedback we’re also adding the following items to provide more information on a few items:

* Approximately one-third of the $10M of financial incentives to Uniswap users for green asset pools will be placed in a multisig with the Celo Foundation and 2-4 key members of the Uniswap community, including both individuals and institutions. This is to serve as a good faith deposit and demonstrate the Celo Foundation’s commitment to the Uniswap community, while also ensuring financial flexibility for the Celo Foundation. In the past, the Celo Foundation has ensured that promised rewards have been paid out (e.g. Sushi) and the plan is to continue doing so.
* Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Celo by the Celo community through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script).” contingent upon approval by the Uniswap community via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth).
* Governance at deployment will be facilitated by messaging bridge [Optics](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/optics)
* Robert Leifke and Kyle Scott, members of Blockchain at Michigan, are co-founders of Mobius, a Celo stableswap protocol. To avoid any conflicts of interest, they have had no involvement in this partnership between Blockchain at Michigan and the Celo Foundation.

### Updated Proposal discussion Topic:

Deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo to Launch “Green Asset” Liquidity Pools and expand access to Uniswap to the 6B smartphone users around the world

### Description:

In partnership with the Celo Foundation and the [Celo Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/), we propose to authorize the deployment of the Uniswap protocol to Celo on behalf of the community.

Celo is a mobile-first, carbon-negative, EVM-compatible blockchain. Specifically, we propose launching Uniswap on the Celo platform to:

* Increase Uniswap’s influence through $10M in financial incentives to Uniswap users, as well as additional grant funding provided by the Celo Foundation to utilize Uniswap as a financial building block
* Bring Uniswap V3’s increased capital efficiency to the 6B smartphone users around the world
* Create green asset liquidity pools with natural capital backed assets such as tokenized carbon credits (e.g. MCO2 and TCO2) and future nature backed assets issued on Celo like land and forests
* Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the Celo Reserve with nature backed assets rather than relying on centralized exchanges
* Foster pathways for future green use cases on Uniswap

Overall, we believe the Uniswap community’s mission of creating a trustless and decentralized financial infrastructure accessible to anyone aligns with Celo’s vision of tackling climate change and achieving prosperity for all.

### About Celo:

Celo’s mission is to build an open financial system that creates the conditions of prosperity for all. To execute this mission, Celo’s technology features include:

* A mobile-first EVM-compatible layer 1 blockchain that is accessible to anyone with a smartphone
* Carbon negative by allocating 0.1% of epoch rewards to offset carbon—to date, [2,942](https://www.wren.co/profile/celo) tons of carbon has been offset, [which is over 8 times Celo’s carbon footprint](https://medium.com/celoorg/a-carbon-negative-blockchain-its-here-and-it-s-celo-60228de36490)
* Algorithmic Celo stablecoins (currently cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL) with a smart-contract based expansion and contraction platform called Mento
* An overcollateralized basket of crypto assets called the [Celo reserve](https://celoreserve.org/), currently made up of CELO, the network’s native asset, as well as BTC, ETH, DAI, and MCO2

Celo is one of the fastest growing DeFi ecosystems with 2.6[M addresses, up to 1.1M daily transactions, and over 103M transactions](https://thecelo.com/). Additionally, Celo [has been chosen by Kickstarter](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/08/kickstarter-to-start-blockchain-based-crowdfunding-project-report/) for its upcoming decentralized product (to date, Kickstarter has successfully supported over[ 214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats)) which will attract new users to the ecosystem

The Celo Reserve includes almost $1M of MCO2 tokens, and Celo community members have proposed to add more natural capital assets moving forward as part of the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/). By including more natural capital assets, the Celo community has the vision of creating natural capital backed currencies. If, as a society, we were to denominate our economic activity in natural capital backed currencies, any economic growth—increase in money circulation—would lead to a growth in preserved natural resources. Celo aims to be the layer 1 blockchain for natural capital assets, and Uniswap can be the natural capital DEX for these assets on Celo.

### Proposal

Blockchain technology can help address limit greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable practices by tokenizing carbon-sequestering assets such as rainforests. Those tokenized assets can then be purchased by individuals and businesses to democratize carbon offsetting and increase funding for environmental protection projects. We believe that together, Uniswap and Celo can lead the path to growing natural capital assets.

Uniswap on the Celo platform will:

* Allow for the launch of green asset liquidity pools: With the launch of the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/), Celo community members proposed to allocate up to 40% of the reserve over time towards natural capital backed assets. A natural capital backed asset (also known as “green” or “regenerative finance” asset) is a tokenized representation of natural assets in the “real” world. An example of a green asset is a non-fungible carbon-negative initiative quantified in terms of fungible CO2 sequestered (e.g. tokenized carbon credits).
* Advance the use of natural capital backed currencies: The Celo Reserve grows as demand for Celo stable currencies grows. And as the reserve grows, so does the allocation towards green assets. This creates a feedback mechanism: with increased adoption of Celo stable currencies the reserve programmatically generates demand for additional green assets, preserving rainforests, and other carbon-sequestering assets.
* Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the reserve: The Celo reserve will not only need to rebalance its BTC, ETH, etc. holdings but also a variety of natural capital backed assets, such as tokenized land, forests, and carbon credits. If approved by Celo’s community governance, a 40% allocation at current reserve values would correspond to natural capital assets worth 200M USD held by the reserve alone, requiring an efficient and liquid trading counterpart. Currently, the reserve rebalances via centralized exchanges. Green assets are not held by centralized exchanges, and so a decentralized exchange is needed in order to rebalance the Celo reserve as demand for stable currencies increases.
* Increase capital efficiency: Uniswap v3’s concentrated liquidity mechanism will be especially important for Celo’s stablecoins that trade within a small price range.
* Create pathways for future green use cases: Market participants are actively exploring other use cases on Celo. A list of current projects is available on https://climatecollective.org/.

The Celo Foundation will commit $10M of CELO in Uniswap-specific user incentives & grants on Celo. The Celo Foundation has successfully delivered committed rewards in the past (e.g. Sushi) and intends to do so in this instance as well. As a good faith deposit, approximately one-third of the $10M of financial incentives to Uniswap users for green asset pools will be placed in a multisig with the Celo Foundation and 2-4 key members of the Uniswap community, including both individuals and institutions. The $10M of financial incentives to Uniswap users for green asset pools will be placed in a multisig with the Celo Foundation and 2-4 key and active members of the Uniswap community including both individuals and institutions. In addition to the $10M in financial incentives for Uniswap specifically, the Celo Foundation will also focus on broader adoption of natural capital backed currencies and link this to ongoing efforts to making DeFi and crypto more accessible to the 6B smartphone users around the world through the following:

* Promote the development of a mobile-first ecosystem through developer programs such as hackathons with Uniswap as a financial building block

* Lead pilots and users research to help make Uniswap more accessible, especially in markets that lack access to basic financial tools and services.
* Co-grant program to support projects that are launching and driving the growth of “green assets”

Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Celo by cLabs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script).” contingent upon approval by the Uniswap community via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth). Governance at deployment will be facilitated by the messaging bridge [Optics](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/optics).

We propose a transparent measurement of this project's success through the following success criteria and long-term goals:

* % of Celo Reserve allocated to green assets: 40% of the Celo Reserve (at current Celo Reserve levels this would correspond to $200M USD in green assets)
* $ total TVL and TVL of associated green assets: 10x of Celo Reserve green asset holdings in circulation as LP
* Impact of green assets in Celo Reserve: 17M tons of CO2 avoided or removed from the atmosphere (assuming an average price of $12 per ton and current Celo Reserve levels) , including all associated benefits (e.g. increase in biodiversity through protection of forests). This corresponds roughly to the annual absorption capacity of 1.7M hectares of forest area, or roughly the amount of [forest area lost in Brazil in 2020](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2020/).

### Conclusion

Celo and Uniswap together can serve as the foundation for the proliferation of natural capital assets across Web3. We believe that the vision to advance climate and regenerative finance on Celo aligns with the Uniswap community. Thank you for your consideration and we welcome questions and suggestions.

The BIP 66 proposal linked below has reached quorum with all three portions of the vote receiving overwhelming approval. 
The proposal would create deeper and more concentrated liquidity for DIGG in the near-term by increasing/consolidating emissions and re-funding KPI options rewards; while also establishing a treasury controlled liquidity at a relatively low cost and provide scalability as DIGG goes through a positive rebase streak and creates more BTC.

352,"## Proposal
SEBA submits a proposal to Aave Governance for adding SEBA Bank as a “Whitelister” to Aave Arc.

SEBA is a licensed and supervised Swiss Bank providing a seamless and secure bridge between digital and traditional assets. SEBA serves professional and institutional clients which include top-tier private banks, asset managers and crypto companies. The interest of SEBA’s clients and prospects for crypto earning products has grown substantially overtime. Initially lending crypto and staking with SEBA, those investors are now showing significant interest for accessing yields in DeFi protocols. Due to various regulatory restrictions in their jurisdictions, SEBA’s institutional clientele has not been able deploy liquidities at large scale in Aave until now. The launch of Aave Arc with its permissioned layer represents a great opportunity for them to access DeFi yields while remaining compliant with their regulatory obligations. At SEBA, we believe that this will directly benefit the Aave community with institutional liquidities accelerating growth in TVL and in protocol revenues. 

The Aave Governance will review and approve Whitelisters that will conduct the requisite level of due diligence on Aave Arc participants. As a Swiss digital asset bank, we believe that SEBA is ideally positioned to provide those investors with the flexible and fully regulated platform that they need to bridge new liquidities in Aave Arc.

## About SEBA Bank
Founded in April 2018 and headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, SEBA Bank is a pioneer in the banking industry with the mission to build a regulated and progressive technological bridge between the traditional and the crypto worlds. With a FINMA banking and securities dealer license, SEBA Bank closes an important gap between the new digital economy and traditional banking. SEBA Bank enables professional individuals and companies as well as institutional clients to invest, custody, trade, stake, lend and borrow digital and traditional assets, all in one place. 

What SEBA brings to the Aave Arc community:

*	A fully regulated digital assets bank that embraces innovation
*	With a large institutional client base in demand for exploring new opportunities in DeFi
*	And with a banking-grade platform to securely bridge liquidities in Aave ARC

### Goal of the vote
Establish policies and guidelines on Temperature Check Votes held on snapshot for 0x DAO. **This is a second iteration after a first vote on this matter, removing one of the requirements (minimum addresses).**

### Scope
The purpose of snapshot proposals is to gauge community sentiment on serious topics under consideration for onchain governance votes that impact 0x protocol.

Temperature checks are non-binding. For example, while a temperature check might indicate community support to introduce a change in smart contracts, a team will have to submit a complete ZEIP vote to come into effect. The same applies to Treasury proposals, which always require an onchain-binding vote.

The domain upon which the community of ZRX holders has decision-making power includes:

- 0x protocol (smart contracts and their deployments)
- [0x Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0bb1810061c2f5b2088054ee184e6c79e1591101)
- [ZRX Portal UI](https://0x.org/zrx)
- ZRX token

**Posts regarding airdrops and frontend integrators (such as Matcha) do not meet these criteria and will be deleted.**

### Process and requirements
- Temperature checks can be initiated by any ZRX holder or delegate with a voting power of **at least 10k (ten thousand) ZRX**.
- A link to an existing discussion on gov.0x.org must be provided in the description of the vote.
- The vote is considered valid once it reaches a **quorum of 1M (one million) ZRX** ~~with at least 50 addresses voting~~. The quorum is intended to be set on the winning option (not on the sum of votes on all options).
- A temperature check vote must last **at least 5 days**. In case of tighter deadlines, a 3 days (72 hours) duration could be accepted.
Any proposal that does not meet the criteria will be either ignored or deleted from the space.

## Summary

This proposal is to add ARB to Aave v3 on Arbitrum. ARB is Arbitrum's governance token, an ERC-20 token native to the Arbitrum One chain.

## Motivation

Arbitrum represents a governance token in the Ethereum scaling ecosystem. It is widely distributed, initially across 625,000 wallet addresses - including to DAOs like Aave.

Adding support for ARB in Arbitrum v3 pools adds greater TVL and user experience to the increasingly popular Aave v3 Arbitrum market - and additional revenue opportunities for Aave. 

By enabling borrowing, it allows users and institutions to take a unique position on this Governance token as the network matures and builds a decentralized community.

Furthermore, it more closely aligns the Aave community with Arbitrum and, by extension, Ethereum.

## Specifications

**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**

   * @Fig is a Governance Contributor at Flipside Crypto, a  professional delegate and contributor to Aave, Maker, Optimism, 0x, and additionally Arbitrum.

**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**

   *  Arbitrum Rollup and Arbitrum AnyTrust are protocols that make Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper. Developers use Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, the chains that implement these protocols, respectively, to build user-friendly decentralized apps.
* The distribution of the $ARB governance token decentralizes governance of these protocols and their respective chains, as well as any future chains the Arbitrum DAO authorizes.
* $ARB tokens can be used to vote on Arbitrum DAO governance proposals, allowing $ARB holders to shape Arbitrum's future together


**3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**

  * Owning $ARB makes you a member of the Arbitrum DAO and allows you to participate in Arbitrum's on-chain governance. A series of smart contracts are responsible for bridging $ARB between Arbitrum One and Ethereum. This will benefit the Aave community by creating a vibrant ecosystem around Aave v3 Arbitrum while being a strong primary use case for ARB.


**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO, is it live? Products, are they live? How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**

  * Arbitrum DAO governs a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain, represented by delegates and individual token holders. Arbitrum One is built by Offchain Labs, and the DAO is serviced by the Arbitrum Foundation. The Arbitrum Foundation has been seeded as of April 2023 - dedicated to the decentralization, security & growth of Arbitrum technologies, including Arbitrum One & Nova.


**5. How is the asset currently used?**

* $ARB makes you a member of the Arbitrum DAO and allows you to participate in Arbitrum's on-chain governance. ARB is currently traded on Coinbase Exchange, Binance, and Uniswap.


**6. Emission schedule**

For the initial airdrop, 12.75% of the ARB supply was distributed across 600,000+ wallets. The distribution was broken down into individuals and DAOs:

* 11.62% of tokens will be initially distributed to users 
* 1.13% distributed to DAOs in the Arbitrum ecosystem *(including Aave)*

The remaining 87.25%  of the token supply is distributed as the following:

* 35.28% to the Arbitrum DAO treasury overseen by governance protocol
* 7.5% to the Arbitrum Foundation (as approved by the DAO)
* 26.94% to the Offchain Labs team and future advisers

## ***Simple Summary***

As Aave grows, there is a need for more advanced features that ensure the privacy and security of participants. Private voting is one such feature that would help to accomplish this goal.

Making use of [partial private voting](https://blog.shutter.network/shutter-brings-shielded-voting-to-snapshot/) within the Snapshot platform (shielded voting) will enhance Aave’s governance and voters - leading to more fair and accurate results in the Snapshot stage.

Shielded voting allows voters to hide their votes during the duration of the voting process and reveal their choices and results after the vote concludes.

We propose that the community votes to turn on the private voting module for a **two-month trial period**, which can be reverted by the community and Space administrators at any time.

This allows Aave to judge the efficacy of shielded voting in Snapshot and serve as a leader for Governance in other DAOs in adapting, experimenting, and innovating with new mechanisms.

## ***Motivation***

Aave Governance features both on-chain and off-chain voting. In the signal stage, Snapshot, votes have become decided by a few voters without many diversions.

After speaking with other delegates, we recognize these outcomes and votes may not always reflect the true wishes of the community; it has become political. An example from Shutter’s blog of how the current process could be political, is below:

Consider a contentious vote in which a minority is pushing the poll early in one direction. Voters that don't have a strong opinion already formed might see this and think the outcome is already decided. Thus, they will be discouraged from voting and also from researching/forming an opinion. This could then lead to the vote going in favor of the minority due to voter apathy, which would not be a good outcome, given that the goal of the poll is to represent the majority opinion.

Aave’s Snapshot space must be a place for honesty and candid feedback; without these values, the space becomes redundant and leads to burnout [proposal coming soon.]

By shielding the individual votes, it encourages voters of different sizes and opinions to participate and feel empowered, leading the DAO toward a more fair outcome.

Snapshot has recently introduced Shielded voting, announced[ here](https://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o).

Shielded voting has four keys benefits:

1. Prevents voter intimidation or coercion
2. Prevent early voters' decisions from influencing the decisions of later voters, thus reduce herding behavior and encourage independent thinking.
3. Protects participants' privacy by ensuring that their voting preferences are not exposed
4. Enhances the overall security and integrity of the Snapshot platform by making it more difficult for bad actors to interfere with the voting process

A [demo](https://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o) reveals a minimal change in the Snapshot UI:

This functionality is powered by Shutter Network.

## ***Specification***

The steps for upgrading a Snapshot space to Shielded voting are as follows:

-> admin of the “Aave” space go to the settings page in the “Voting” section

-> choose Shutter as a privacy option and click “Save”

-> all proposals from then on will use shielded voting.

The community may disable this feature anytime.

The current list of Snapshot admins is as follows:

* @monetsupply
* @MarcZeller 
* 0xc8E0345596D7196941E61D3aB607E57Fe61F85E7
* 0x2357df661D0E56140dF30c3ad0b2B426fB4666e6
* 0x60C8dC4762b217b4A00FF1824111077f331B1FbF
* 0x2D0D6A8553993a3E9eD1D86415358D1EDEfa82F1

## ***Success Criteria***

The time period the below criteria will be considered over will be 2 months prior to private voting being enabled vs. 2 months from when the time it is enabled.

* Average spread between YES to NO votes
* Number of unique voters voting
* Difference between outcomes of the votes, i.e., what % of votes result in YES

For each of these criteria, success is when the average spread between YES to NO votes reduces, the number of unique voters increases, and there is greater variety in the outcome of the votes. 

These outcomes would indicate increased and more thorough engagement across the community.

title: [ARFC] Polygon Supply Cap Update 23.05.2023
discussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-polygon-supply-cap-update-23-05-2023/13190
shortDescription: Increase Supply Cap MaticX on Polygon v3 from 29.3M units to 38.0M units. 
author: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic
created: 2023-05-23

---

# Summary

This publication proposes increasing the MaticX Supply Cap on Polygon v3 from 29.3M units to 38.0M units.

# Abstract

The current Supply Cap's utilisation is hovering around 95.4%, with 1.33M units of MaticX deposit capacity. The previous Supply Cap increase from 17.2M to 29.3M is filling rapidly. This publication seeks to increase the Supply Cap in effort to enable MaticX deposit growth to continue. 

# Motivation

Over the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. 

With Liquidity Mining (LM) ongoing, MaticX deposit rewards (SD) and wMATIC borrowing rewards (stMATIC & MaticX), it is important that Aave DAO ensures there is adequate capacity to enable the many yield maximising products built on Aave v3 to grow. 

With an abundance of wMATIC deposits and LM ongoing, we are experiencing exception MaticX deposit growth. 

 
![Screenshot 2023-05-28 at 19.19.48.png](ipfs://bafkreihzi2cmpwhakz3wx2c63vtmxrhnliqfndk2ufnhwjpmbtlboyceje)
    

To facilitate the continued growth of MaticX, this proposal seeks to increase the Supply Cap to 75% of supply on Polygon. This is the maximum counterparty risk Aave DAO has voted to support.

Current MaticX supply on Polygon is [50,559,800 units](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6). Therefore the newly proposed Supply Cap is 38,000,000 units (rounded up). The author expects a whale to be moving liquidity from Ethereum to Polygon, if this was to occur in the next day or so, then the proposed Supply Cap will be raised, with support from one risk service provider.

With reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) the preferred path forward is to implement several upgrades to gradually increase Aave's MaticX exposure over time.

359,"*We @she256 are submitting this RFC & proposal on behalf of Zora Labs. For the full proposal/discussion, please see the linked forum post. 

# Proposal Motivation
Zora Network is an emergent ETH L2 built with the OP stack that has grown to more than [90k weekly active users](https://dune.com/queries/3102622/5177887) who drive [600k transactions every week](https://dune.com/jhackworth/zora-network). We propose a canonical deployment of Uniswap v3 on Zora benefitting creators, collectors, and builders of both ecosystems.

Zora Network is onboarding thousands of creators and collectors to Ethereum L2s through a distinctly creative brand and support from protocols like Mint.Fun, Holograph, PartyDAO, and the Zora Creator Toolkit. It is important for Zora Network’s ecosystem of creators, collectors, and developers to have access to premier crypto tooling, including DeFi protocols, that can help them protect and expand the value they are creating onchain.

We believe offering these tools is a material step in supporting creators as they explore and innovate with onchain media. This is particularly true as the amount of people and teams that earn ETH on Zora Network continues to grow from features like Zora’s Protocol Rewards.

This collaboration will position Uniswap to win long term market share on an emergent L2 network with a uniquely differentiated user base. And, it will signal the DAO’s ongoing support of the growing population of creators, collectors, and builders that transact on Zora Network everyday.

# Rationale for Uniswap on Zora Network
[Protocol Rewards on Zora Network](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/8192123-understanding-protocol-rewards-on-zora) makes the need for stablecoins and fiat on/off-ramps increasingly apparent. Creators, collectors, and developers in the Zora ecosystem are [earning six figures of ETH in protocol rewards everyday](https://dune.com/queries/3216223/5376687). For some creators, protocol rewards are helping to [pay their rent ](https://warpcast.com/tokenart.eth/0xfb0ded63)or just grab a slice of pizza. And for platforms, rewards are quickly becoming a core part of their business model and a key to their success.

There is a growing need on Zora Network for swaps and stablecoins that can better protect the value these individuals and teams create. Today, creators are required to bridge their ETH from Zora Network to a chain where Uniswap is supported, which costs gas and eats into their earnings. Only then will they be able to swap to a stablecoin. Adding swaps natively on Zora Network will make taking this action cheaper and easier for onchain creators that are making their living with Protocol Rewards.

Our goal with this proposal is to bring a canonical instance of world class DeFi tooling to Zora Network participants to help them more efficiently convert and expand their Protocol Rewards into value that they can transact with in their everyday lives. We think this is an exciting long tail opportunity for Uniswap.

### Uniswap on Zora Network enables
* Stablecoins for thousands of creators, collectors, and builders on Zora Network
* Swaps for Zora Network participants without needing to bridge funds
* Fiat payment rails to easily on and off ramps, for our creators, collectors, and builders
* Creating and transacting in additional token types ERC20 tokens
* Developer teams requiring liquidity pools for markets or experimentation

# Benefits to Uniswap
Uniswap would be the first DeFi protocol on Zora Network giving it a first mover advantage to win consideration from the network’s unique audience of creators and collectors. 

## Expand the Uniswap Audience
Recent market data from cross-chain minting activations indicate that, when given the option and equal incentive, creators [tend to choose Zora Network](https://x.com/js_horne/status/1744719299460337785?s=20) as the destination for their work onchain. Uniswap and Zora Network coming together is a great opportunity to expand the Uniswap audience to Zora Network’s creative community.

Zora Network is home to tens of thousands of creators of all disciplines: visual artists, musicians, photographers, podcasters, and more. Incredible crypto native talent like Chase Chapman, Nick Hollins from UFO, and more have made Zora Network their L2 of choice. This is all happening alongside some of the world’s best YouTube channels like [Color Studios](https://colorsxstudios.com/collect) or breakout brands like [KidSuper ](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x3a669992d78cf9fd0f23a589c152ea4d2c5e7ed0/1)making Zora their home as well.

Uniswap V3 on Zora Network is an opportunity for Uniswap to market to a new, non-DeFi audience that is excited to support one another’s creativity. You can get a feel for who makes up the Zora community in our latest [Me + My Imagination campaign](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1735359375840297265/quotes).

## Potential new revenue stream for Uniswap DAO
The most immediate increase in DAO revenue will come from a Uniswap x Zora commemorative mint. Zora will mint a commemorative artwork to celebrate the launch of Uniswap V3. We will add the Uniswap DAO as a split recipient on this commemorative mint. This will mean that the Uniswap DAO will receive ETH income in the [form of protocol rewards](https://docs.zora.co/docs/smart-contracts/creator-tools/rewards) as collectors mint the artwork in celebration of the launch.

Zora plans to split the creator rewards from this mint 70-30 with 70% of rewards from this mint going to the Uniswap DAO and 30% going to Zora.

Commemorative mints also help teams build onchain followings that can be reactivated on Zora and pinged via on platform notifications. For example, [LayerZero gained 74k followers ](https://zora.co/0xc96454d527192f519f2e5f1d21e295ef56df7d73)on Zora as a result of their commemorative mint for Zora Network support in September 2023. It is easy to imagine Uniswap building an onchain audience on Zora that includes millions of its users.

## Increase DEX Marketshare
Uniswap will be the first DEX to come to market on Zora Network. It will start out with 100% marketshare on this emergent L2 network. The more than half a million addresses on Zora Network will have a single destination for DeFi.

Zora Network has an increasingly active user base with active addresses on Zora Network are up 50% MoM from December to January. And, that user base is earning ETH at a good rate with more than $100k of ETH paid out daily on Zora Network in Protocol Rewards. Given these earnings and these levels of activity, there is a good chance these users will need stablecoins and other opportunities to protect the value their creating.

# Success Criteria
For Uniswap, this is a unique opportunity to become the sole DEX on Zora Network, a breakout L2 for onchain creativity. This will help Uniswap win increasing amounts of creator affinity as you support the thousands of active creators and collectors around the world using Zora Network.

In addition, we consider this successful for Uniswap if we are able to:

* Launch a successful commemorative mint to excite Zora’s community about Uniswap
* Onboard Zora’s onchain creative and developer community to Uniswap
* Partner with Zora on future Uniswap DAO activations, hackathons, etc.

We want to give our network participants the tools they need to convert the value they create on Zora Network into stablecoins and real world currencies they can use everyday. By weaving Uniswap V3 seamlessly into this emergent network, we aspire to strengthen the ties between Uniswap and Zora, ensuring a mutually beneficial collaboration between our thriving communities.


# Deployment Details
Uniswap V3 has been deployed to the Zora Sepolia Network. All contracts have been verified on the [network block explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zora.energy). We will update the proposal with the appropriate mainnet addresses before submitting this vote onchain.

As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the Uniswap v3 Factory contract on Zora Network.


## Front End Considerations
Zora will deploy the [open source Uniswap UI](https://github.com/Uniswap/interface) to a subdomain at https://zora.energy. This front end will be made available to all Zora Network users similar to https://bridge.zora.energy. Our goal is to ensure that there is an easy to use frontend interface for users to access the superpowers of Uniswap. Overtime, we will work with the Uniswap Labs team to get Zora Network added to the primary Uniswap website over time.

# Bridge Details
Zora Network is built on the open-source OP Stack. As a result, the bridge for Zora Network operates functionally identical to both OP Mainnet and Base – two OP Stack chains with canonical Uniswap V3 deployments already live. The bridge address is listed below, and more information on the OP Stack Bridge design is available [here](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/dapp-developers/bridging/basics). As a further convenience, Zora Network hosts a bridging interface at https://bridge.zora.energy.

### Summary
This proposal seeks to onboard slisBNB, a tokenized version of staked BNB introduced by Lista DAO, to Aave V3 on the BNB Chain.

### **Motivation**

slisBNB is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) from ListaDAO, which aims to bring additional liquidity and utility to staked BNB. The token allows users to participate in the staking rewards while maintaining the flexibility to use their staked assets within the DeFi ecosystem.

Onboarding slisBNB will allow Aave users to utilize it as collateral, thus broadening the asset base and enhancing overall liquidity.

### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments

Users who supply slisBNB liquidity on Aave, will be eligible to get stardust (points) from Lista's ongoing point system Cosmic Adventure Challenge Season 3, which will turn to LISTA token airdrop when Season 3 ends.

title: [TEMP CHECK] Safety Module Upgrade Part III - Enable gauges on BPT in Safety Module (smBPT)

# Summary

This publication presents the community with an opportunity to improve the capital efficiency of the Safety Module (SM) by enabling deposits to earn yield from other protocols and discuss the smBPT gauges proposal.

# Abstract

The previous proposal presented the community with the opportunity to include LP positions in the SM. Those same LP positions can be deposited into other protocols to earn yield without the prospect of being slashed. These alternative investment options create an opportunity cost and act as a minimum APY hurdle rate when considering investing in Aave’s SM.

This publication presents an opportunity to enable participants in the Aave SM to earn rewards from other protocols whilst providing a backstop to Aave. The inclusion of GHO pools further helps provide sustained liquidity in the market and generate revenue for Aave through GHO’s borrow rate.

This introduces the prospect of increasing the sustainability of the SM by enabling rewards to scale with TVL over time which is currently solely dependent upon AAVE’s price correlation with the SM’s TVL given the fixed distribution limitation.

This proposal will discuss the differences between “classic” gauges and specific ones (“smBPT gauges”) as outlined in the [intro post](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029/6?u=dydymoon), and will introduce the strategy.

# Motivation

The Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for ‘Balancer Pool Token’) for a time duration up to 1 year. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.

Balancer token emission is currently at 121,930 BAL/week and decreases linearly each year.

veBAL holders can vote each week to redirect part of these incentives to the pool of their choice.

At the time of writing, 1 veBAL can redirect 0.01187 BAL /veBAL vote/week ($0.0851).

By using the voting power & voting incentives, it is possible to either leverage better rewards for the similar $$ cost or similar APR rewards with reduced cost. Our calculations are based on delivering a similar APR to users whilst reducing the overall dollar spend on the SM.

Like Curve, the APR of liquidity pools staked on Balancer (BPT-XX-gauge) can be boosted up 2.5x depending on several parameters, such as veBAL boost holdings, value deposited, total TVL of the pool etc. However, having the max boost requires a huge amount of veBAL, which most projects don’t have.

While they can still buy boosts on Marketplace like Warden, it can be expensive and potentially limitate the strategy profitability. However, there are projects accumulating a considerable amount of veTokens to mutualize the boost, improving the yield for depositors.

Aura Finance is the biggest on the Balancer ecosystem with [27% of the veBAL held by the protocol](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/balancer). These holdings are utilized to boost the users deposits (Most of the pools are currently boosted ~1.4x).

It’s important to note that 25% of all BAL earned on Aura are captured by the protocol, which distributes AURA rewards in return, the Aura Finance governance token. More details on the AURA distribution can be found [here](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/usdaura/distribution).

The AURA token can be locked for 4 months for vlAURA without decay on the voting power, which allows to participate on Aura Governance, Balancer gauges votes as it controls the underlying veBAL voting power, and can receive rewards in auraBAL & vote incentives. At this time, 1 vlAURA controls 0.2081 veBAL. Once a gauge is voted on Balancer, the pool is added on Aura Finance in the following days.

The goal of this proposal is to consider staking the LPs deposited in the SM on Aura Finance, to receive BAL + AURA rewards distributed to SM depositors. However, there are different possibilities to reach this goal:

## “Classic” gauges mechanism

After a liquidity pool is created, an application is shared on the respective communities governance forum to create a gauge. Upon creation, users are able to deposit their LPs into the gauges to earn rewards.

Projects like Aura Finance receive the BPTs, deposit them into the Balancer gauge and retain a portion of the BAL emission in exchange of their own governance token. Users receive an elevated yield to reward users for the additional smart contract risk and premium for replacing BAL with AURA. Aave could deploy contracts within the SM that extends this concept and enable users to receive Aura Finance and Balancer rewards.

Most projects are proposing to enable the gauge on the BPT assets. This works quite well because they are creating vote incentives (often with their native token) to acquire votes in veBAL & wrappers, directing more rewards to the pool, making it attractive for the community to deposit liquidity.

However, if Aave’s SM was to accept the BPT directly and not deposit the BPT into the Balancer Gauge. Any users could deposit & stake their BPT to receive BPT-gauge without depositing in the SM, allowing them to bypass the SM lock period and cooldown to receive the same incentives as SM depositors, so classic gauges invalidates the strategy

This would create a huge dilution for Aave, which is a large issue when the liquidity also doubles as protocol insurance. If Aave was to offer the same APR as Aura Finance there is no incentive for users to take on the additional shortfall and cool down period lock up risk/opportunity cost.

In Part IV, the SM upgrade proposal will consider using 75% of the current incentives budget for volatile & stable BPTs categories. That’s 825 AAVE/ day that could either be used to incentivize the pools directly (Not recommended to keep doing liquidity mining for all categories) or to create vote incentives for the associated gauges driving a higher rewards value to the pools.

This method can still be used for main liquidity pools outside of the SM, but to keep the proposed strategy profitable for Aave, an alternative could be what this publication will refer to as “smBPT gauges” which is a suggestion from Solarcurve.

## “smBPT gauges mechanism”

The method requires implementing a wrapper in the safety module. The SM contract receives BPT from users, and deposits in the wrapper contract which would mint smBPT received by the SM.

Instead of enabling gauges that accept the BPT, Balancer can approve BAL emissions to gauges which accept the smBPT. Users would have the option to deposit the BPT into Aave’s SM to mint smBPT which will be deposited on Aura Finance which then deposits the smBPT into the Balancer gauge.

This means that any users could deposit liquidity and receive the trading fees on the underlying Balancer pools, but only users who stake their BPT in the SM would be eligible to gauge rewards.

If the smBPT gauges are approved by the Balancer DAO, Aura Finance will implement the pools associated with these gauges. The gauges will only accept smBPT. This eliminates the opportunity cost as users can not deposit into Aura Finance or Balancer’s gauge directly and avoid the slashing plus cool down risk. Considering that the SM would mint the smBPT internally, it would be the only contract available to stake on this gauge.

Once deposited, the SM contract would receive “aurasmBPT-gauge” and mint “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” distributed to the initial BPT depositors.

If a user wants to withdraw from the SM, he would activate the cooldown period. The SM contract would then burn the “aurasmBPT-gauge” by unstaking from Aura Finance to receive smBPT. It would then unlock and distribute the BPT as well as burn the smBPT and “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” once the withdrawal is done.

At this point, and while several aspects of the proposals have been updated since the strategy introduction post, this chart should help understand and visualize the overall strategy described.

 ![image](ipfs://bafkreih2bqouhr75txq5jog2gi4xdstlorn7wb3qdhjkzhlmhem6ojn7ey)
    
Considering that the veBAL voting power held by Aave is not enough to sustain these pools with good TVL, the goal is to use part of the SM rewards budget as votes incentives.

The part IV of this proposal will focus on incentives management updates and details on estimations made, while the part V will be mostly about further considerations.

## smBPT Risks

To implement interoperability and integrate different protocols, several changes are needed, which will result in the upgraded SM contracts having greater smart contract risk than in the current implementation. Introducing smBPT to the SM creates additional Balancer gauge and Aura smart contract risk exposure.

The current ABPT integration demonstrates the community's willingness to have exposure to the Balancer protocol within the SM. Aave further demonstrated confidence in the Balancer <> Aave partnership via the token swap performed during 2022. Since then, Balancer has launched several liquidity pools which deposit funds in Aave v3 across several networks. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)

Aave and Balancer have been working together since the launch of the Safety Module. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)

Aura Finance is a protocol built on top of the[ Balancer system](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) to provide maximum incentives to Balancer liquidity providers and BAL stakers (into[ veBAL](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512)) through social aggregation of BAL deposits and Aura’s native token. Even if the protocol is relatively young (launched on June 3, 2022), the team has an extensive focus on security, having run 3 [audits](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/security#audits): [Peckshield](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S5jnMddjbVUsAdVZtmcIRlL4WhVueSzp/view), [Halborn,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vsZ9aAVJ8mobLaJ5-XDejcHdRFK1StjM/view) [Code4rena](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts/blob/main/audits/Code4rena-Audit-Report-AuraFinance-v1.0.pdf)

Aura started a $1 million [bug bounty program on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/aurafinance/) on June 16, 2022 and to date, no vulnerabilities have been found.

Moreover, Aura was given a rating of [88% from DeFiSafety](https://defisafety.com/app/pqrs/526) which also suggested improvements to protocol documentation (actively being worked on now by contributors).

Finally, some security researchers and developers are closely looped into Aura via its multisig, and general protocol oversight.

## Smart Contract Considerations

Aave Governance as admin, can perform the following:

* Add/remove assets into the SM
* Invoke Emergency power to withdraw of all funds deployed by the SM on Aura
* Update reward budget influencing the SM yield
* Update the slashing parameters & associated yield ranges

Aave SM as admin, can perform the following:

* Receive BPT and mint smBPT
* Deposit/withdraw smBPT from Aura
* Mint/Burn smBPT and aurasmBPT-XX-gauge
* Claim BAL & AURA rewards
* Redistribute the rewards to StkaurasmBPT-XX-gauge or StkTokens holders (This can probably done weekly/bi-weekly)

# Technical Specifications

* Deploy wrapper contract to wrap BPT into smBPT (BGD)
* Enable gauges on smBPT voted in Part I & II. (Llama)
* Enable SM Staking on Aura for Volatile & Stables LP categories (Llama)
* Add rewards management & redistribution mechanism (BGD)

# Voting Options

YAE - Implement smBPT gauges & Aura Staking
NAE - Implement classic BPT gauges
ABSTAIN

# Disclaimer

The Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.

Llama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.

367,"Harmony is proposing to deploy Aave v2 on the Harmony blockchain to expand lending to a growing community of users and provide incentives to bootstrap the launch of Aave to a new ecosystem. 

Paragraph Summary

Our goal is to accelerate Aave's expansion in the multi-chain world. Harmony is an open and fast blockchain that is fully Ethereum compatible with 2-second transaction finality and near-zero fees. 

Harmony invites the Aave community to support this launch by participating in the Aave contracts deployment, enabling the Aave v2 front-end for Harmony markets, and adding Harmony in its recently announced cross-chain governance module roadmap.  

Harmony will start by providing $5M USD in ONE tokens in incentives to bootstrap initial usage of Aave on Harmony. 

We specifically planned for a one year incentive campaign so that net new users have the opportunity to come into Aave and decentralized finance. We know that many protocols are giving out even higher incentives over a short period of time. We chose an attractive incentive over a longer period so that new users who may not be experienced power users can also benefit from the launch. 

In addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support. 

Our overall goal is to use Harmony’s $300 million ecosystem fund for growing a deep base of 10,000 builders and 10 million users. 

Motivation

Aave is already planning to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Harmony ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Sushi on Harmony and other DeFi projects. Aave will be the first major lending protocol on Harmony and will add net new users from Harmony’s 350,000+ community members. After enabling basic DeFi primitives like AMMs, our community is eagerly awaiting lending markets on Harmony. 

Specifications

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

Harmony is a sharded proof-of-stake blockchain. It has processed more than 120M transactions on mainnet and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible. Our secure bridges offer cross-chain asset transfers with Ethereum, Binance and 3 other chains.

For more details, read our documentation.

Metrics
over 18,010 delegators and 118 validators, staking 4.2 billion ONEs ($700m staked)
$84 million TVL on Sushi on Harmony, and $30 million combined on other DEXes
$91 million TVL on Harmony’s bridge to Ethereum and BSC 
3,200 creators and $1.6 million sales on DaVinci NFT marketplace
100+ active apps; over 135,300 active wallets; over 120 million mainnet transactions

A proposal to gradually wind down the CRV market on Aave V2 Ethereum via a series of LT reductions.

## Motivation

In light of the ongoing **[discussions](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644/31)** concerning the CRV market on v2 Ethereum and further propelled by the debates and developments following the **[Vyper Exploit](https://governance.aave.com/t/post-vyper-exploit-crv-market-update-and-recommendations/14214)**, our recommendation remains to deprecate the CRV market on V2 by implementing a series of LT reductions.
We have previously proposed and executed the following reductions:

1. [[ARC] - Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum - LTs and LTVs for Long Tail Assets (2022.12.04)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lts-and-ltvs-for-long-tail-assets-2022-12-04/10926)
2. [[ARFC] - Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - CRV Aave V2 Ethereum - 2023.06.15](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-crv-aave-v2-ethereum-2023-06-15/13709)
3. [[ARFC] - Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - CRV Aave V2 Ethereum - 2023.07.10](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-crv-aave-v2-ethereum-2023-07-10/13952) - execution was canceled due to CRV price volatility. **Given the current market conditions, we plan to resubmit this proposal shortly by AIP.**

While we advocate for proactive offboarding of the market, our recommendation is that the DAO risk managers deliver a bi-weekly analysis and recommendation for each individual LT reduction. This would be similar to the process of increasing supply caps. if the risk managers agree on a single recommendation, the proposal would move directly to an AIP, but in case of disagreement, the more conservative approach would be adopted, with the alternative proposal put to a Snapshot vote for the community to decide.

### Plan:

Following is our recommended bi-weekly plan for communications and community transparency of the process:

- **Monday** - Risk teams conduct independent analyses and recommendations, considering (but not limited to) the following:
    1. Impact of the LT reduction on user positions - number of accounts and total amounts eligible for liquidation post-LT update
    2. Impact of the LT reduction on the health factor of the top accounts
    3. On-chain liquidity 
- **Tuesday** -  Gauntlet and Chaos Labs post a joint recommendation post after syncing on their analyses above
- **Wednesday** - AIP posted
    - If risk teams are not aligned on a single recommendation, a Snapshot vote will be posted to gauge community preference

Title: [ARC] stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool
Author: @llamaxyz @MatthewGraham
Dated: 2022-11-11

---

# Simple Summary

@llamaxyz proposed assigning the stMATIC and MaticX `Emission_Admin` role on the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool to a Gnosis Safe controlled by the Polygon Foundation.

# Abstract

The Polygon Foundation team intends to distribute stMATIC and MaticX incentives to the wMATIC Reserve on Polygon Aave v3.

In order to achieve this, the `EmissionManager` contract needs to assign an owner to the `Emission_Admin` permission allowing stMATIC and MaticX rewards to be distributed, [1,2]. This can only be achieved via the governance process.

This proposal assigns the `Emission_Admin` permission to stMATIC and MaticX rewards to the following address `0x0c54a0BCCF5079478a144dBae1AFcb4FEdf7b263`.

# Motivation

The motivation of the proposal is to enable stMATIC and MaticX rewards to be distributed on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.

Please do note a similar request was submitted enabling the Lido community to distribute LDO rewards across the Polygon Aave v3 liquidity pool, [3].

# Specification

The Polygon Foundation team will determine the emission rate and duration at which stMATIC and MaticX rewards are offered. This will likely be influenced by the Aave DAO’s ability to adjust the wMATIC, stMATIC and MaticX risk parameters that enable users to generate a return from leverage the stMATIC / wMATIC and MaticX/wMATIC loop.

The `Emission_Admin` is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool. The `EmissionManager` determines the stMATIC and MaticX `Emission_Admin` and not the stMATIC or MaticX Reserve. The `Emission_Admin` can distribute stMATIC and MaticX anywhere across the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool.

# Implementation

Set `Emission_Admin` permission for stMATIC `matic:0x3A58a54C066FdC0f2D55FC9C89F0415C92eBf3C4` and MaticX `matic:0xfa68FB4628DFF1028CFEc22b4162FCcd0d45efb6` on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool to Polygon Foundation’s address: `matic:0x0c54a0BCCF5079478a144dBae1AFcb4FEdf7b263`, [4,5,6].

373,"*Summary*

Despite being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols, Uniswap’s outstanding voting power does not necessarily translate into active governance participation. In fact, many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50% vote participation rate, and some even as low as 10% or 0%. While there have been previous [campaigns ](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1653077861706739714?s=20) to encourage delegation by large UNI holders, we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated, if at all.

In healthy governance environments, proactive delegates wield significant voting power, ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met.

Therefore, this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate 2.5 million UNI to each of 4 active yet underrepresented delegates selected based on the criteria outlined below. To ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum (as explained further in Participation Requirements) or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will 1 year term so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without fulling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.

*Landscape of Uniswap Governance*

*Source: Butter*

Despite numerous improvements to Uniswap’s governance, there are still several areas that require further improvement. One prominent area is governance participation, which has witnessed a downward trend compared to late 2022 and early 2023.

Another issue is many large delegates are now inactive, and the delegators who entrusted them with delegation are either unaware about this inactivity or simply do not care. For example, there is currently several delegates with more than 2.5 million UNI delegated who never even voted onchain according to Tally, see the screenshot below.

*Source: Tally*

Therefore, further distributing governance power to active but underrepresented delegates is a positive step forward ensuring governance is more active, resilient, and robust.

**Participation Requirements**

* Must have voted on 80% (or more) of proposals (minus the proposals that were canceled) over the last 3 months (as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot). This includes both Snapshot and Onchain proposals (such as Tally or Agora)
* Must have actively participated in proposal voting for more than 3 months and have a Delegate Platform on Uniswap Forum under Delegation Pitch

**Application Criteria**

* Meets the above Participation Requirements
* Voting Power is less than 2.5 million UNI (as of the date when this proposal is passed on Snapshot).

**Next Steps**

* Should this proposal pass on Snapshot, a 5-day period will begin where delegates that meet the above criterias are encouraged to post their application to be considered for delegation. In cases where there are more than Four qualified applicants, there will be an additional Snapshot vote to determine the top Four. Once Four or fewer applicants are selected (in case there are not enough delegates that meet the criteria), it will proceed to an onchain vote.

**Other Clarification**

-The term will be 1 year from when 2.5 M UNI is delegated.

-Should the onchain vote be approved but there are three or fewer qualified applicants because there are not enough qualified applicants, there WON'T be a subsequent application period and Snapshot vote after the initial vote to fill the remaining available recipients.

-Should the onchain vote be approved and there are qualified applicants but one or more of them are disqualified in the future due to their low vote participation, there will NOT be a new application and snapshot vote to give the opportunity to another delegate.

-As mentioned by in a previous [proposal ](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-onboarding-ekubo-inc-as-a-core-developer-of-uniswap-protocol/22085/20) seeking UNI delegation, there will be deployment of at max four new [Franchiser ](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/blob/main/spec.md) contracts, each one funded with 2.5M UNI (10M UNI total). The owner of these Franchiser instance’s would be the Timelock, while the at max four delegates chosen through the voting process outlined above can act as the delegatees.",bullish

**Title:** [ARFC] Set Aave Chan Initiative as Emission Manager for sUSD on Aave V3 Optimism 
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-03-06

---

# **Summary**

This ARFC proposes to set the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) wallet as the emission manager for the sUSD token on Optimism Aave V3 market. This will enable the ACI to enact incentive programs funded by SNX ecosystem partners for all sUSD markets, promoting growth and expanding the user base of Aave on Optimism.

# Motivation

The Aave Chan Initiative has been in discussion with various parties that have a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of Aave V3 on Optimism. In order to facilitate emissions by various stakeholders, ACI proposes becoming the emissions manager for sUSD on Optimism. Emission incentives will be sent to ACI multisig and distributed as agreed on with partners. 

By setting the multisig as the emission manager for the sUSD token, the ACI will be able to directly manage incentive programs that can attract more users to the protocol and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets on Optimism.

# Specification

The ACI multisig address OP:0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd will be set as Emissions manager.

The call to the setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract will be as follows:

`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(sUSD, 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd);`

This method will set the ACI multisig as the emission admin for the sUSD token on Optimism Aave V3 market.

# Disclaimer

The Aave Chan Initiative is working with Synthetix to define the emissions program for sUSD. ACI has not been paid by any third party for this proposal.

# Next Steps

1. Gather feedback from the community.
2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage

**Title:** [ARFC] Chaos Labs - Update WETH IR on V3 Arbitrum and Optimism - 02.16.2024 
**Author:** Chaos Labs
**Date:** 2024-02-16

---

### Simple Summary

Decrease slope1 on Arbitrum and Optimism from 3.3% to 3%.

### Motivation

Over the last eight months, we have observed a drop-off in WETH interest rates on Ethereum and, thus, relative demand for ETH borrowing.

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreic3lclpvo7ac5253ucpeejalt42j6h3cdjnrd6vaefdlr62nht23e)
    
*Time series of WETH borrow APY on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism, in addition to stETH APY.*


Note that the red dotted line indicates the point when the base_fee decreased from 1% to 0% on Arbitrum and Optimism. This phenomenon can be explained by the drop-off in ETH staking yield, as we can deduce through the relatively strong correlation between WETH borrow APY and stETH staking APY on Ethereum due to profitable looping strategies. Additionally, given Aave prices stETH:ETH 1:1 with the underlying exchange rate, minimal liquidation risk exists in potential wstETH market price movements.

**Correlation Between stETH APY and WETH APY**

![image](ipfs://bafkreidezrni5upml4xk4kzuchihyd4magrivgd5dvkpicynhrl6atenjy)
    
*Correlation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY.*
 
![image](ipfs://bafkreihrjropidawamiki4v4bchp6lgb4fwp2rhvodamveeec4vcqwpgoy)
    
*Cross-correlation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*

Computing the cross-correlation between the three markets, we notice an approximately 1-week lag when this hits the maximum value, implying the speed at which the borrow rates are maximally reflected in the staking APY.

This is statistically significant, as we can see below, where 85%-90% of all WETH debt is backed by ETH LSTs on the respective chain.

### stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY

Interestingly enough, one might think that as stETH yields decrease, looping strategies would become less profitable. However, upon analyzing the difference between the stETH APY and WETH borrow APY (stETH APY - WETH APY) alongside the stETH APY itself at a given time t, a negative correlation emerges, with the peak occurring at a 2-week lag. Essentially, this means that the rate of decrease in borrow APY over time outpaces that of the stETH APY. Thus, we can conclude that when stETH APYs are high, borrowers attempt to extract as much revenue as possible, leading to convergence at lower yields. On the contrary, when stETH APYs are low, borrowers and ETH borrow APYs tend to be less aggressive with looping, perhaps due to theoretical scaling in the interest rate requiring smaller growth to become unprofitable, leading to the effective yield scaling higher than instances when stETH APYs are high. This in turn leads to less efficient markets and larger spreads when ETH staking yields are low.

**WETH Utilization Rates**

*WETH Utilization rate time series.*

Based on the observed trend, it's evident that Arbitrum and Optimism could benefit from a reduction in slope1 to enhance utilization rates and consequently increase revenues. While the decrease in base_rate on both chains did positively impact utilization, it remains suboptimal. Thus, we simply take the P95 of the stETH APY differential vs WETH borrow APY since the base_rate decrease, which returned 0.6%, to derive the decrease in slope1. Considering the Uoptimal rate is projected to be below the current stETH APY with a 0.6% variance, any prolonged convergence above Uoptimal could lead to interest rate volatility. In such a scenario, it would be prudent to revert slope1. However, given the current trend and staking APY, this adjustment would likely result in higher utilization rates and greater profits for the Aave DAO.

Assuming convergence at today’s WETH interest rates:

|  | Arbitrum | Optimism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Old Utilization Rate | 68.69% | 65% |
| New Utilization Rate | 76.5% | 72% |
| Projected Revenue Increase | 13.62 ETH $38.5k year | 4 ETH $11.3k year |

We note that adjusting WETH slope1 on other non-Ethereum chains with this intuition is seen as irrelevant, as either the market itself portrays too small a sample size with minimal relative demand for ETH LSTs as collateral, there does not exist ETH LSTs on the chain or ETH LST supply caps have been at max capacity for months.

###  Specification

| Chain | Asset |Parameter | Currebt |Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- | ---| ---|
| Arbitrum | WETH |Slope1| 3.3% | 3% |
| Optimism | WETH|Slope1|3.3% | 3% |

## Next Steps

1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.
2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.

Title: [ARFC] Continuous Security Proposal Aave <> Certora
Author: @Shelly - Certora
Created: 2023-12-01

---

# Summary

We offer to extend the existing [formal verification and manual review services](https://governance.aave.com/t/security-and-agility-of-aave-smart-contracts-via-continuous-formal-verification/10181)  and provide additional security services:

1. Governance proposal reviews - Review every governance proposal in the on-chain stage as suggested by BGDLabs.
2. We will assist Aave and BGD in reviewing Immunify bug bounties per request.

This proposal asks for a 1-year duration with a budget of $1.5m, starting from the 14th of September 2023.

# Motivation

During the 18 months of services, we have reviewed 169 smart contacts consisting of over 51,289 Solidity lines. We have prevented 28 significant bugs. Full breakdown of our work can be found in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DOU1TniPHNmbrgz-Sy7zduoP9BJrsZkP_cTGRDuiwwg/edit#gid=967449577).

## Continuous Formal Verification (Auditing and Formal Verification integrated into CI)

Following the success of the collaboration in [the last 18 months](https://governance.aave.com/t/security-and-agility-of-aave-smart-contracts-via-continuous-formal-verification/10181/19), we offer to continue this service in the same format - new code is formally verified and manually reviewed. Our [open-source CVL specification rules](https://github.com/Certora/aave-verification-projects-TOC) are checked using the Certora Prover and become publicly available when the code is released. The formal tests are also integrated into Aave’s CI system to continuously check changes introduced into the code. Reports are delivered upon demand at the end of each project. We have recently released a [free version of the Certora Prover](https://www.certora.com/signup?plan=prover) and the community can use this to validate the outputs.

The Aave and BGD teams will play a key role in rule writing going forward. These teams are highly technical and have insights into high-level properties of the protocol. Our team will review these rules and ensure the Certora Prover can formally prove these rules or find a bug. Our team will add more rules and manually review the code.

## Governance Proposal Review
Following BGD’s suggestion to add a third party to the governance proposals verification process, we will allocate a dedicated team to review each proposal on the on-chain stage within 3.5 days.

Each proposal’s payload will be reviewed by the dedicated team, and we will verify that it does what it’s supposed to do according to its description/AIP. We will also check that there are no unwanted effects on the codebase, which is supposed to stay unchanged.

Our job will be done after a review by BGD at an earlier stage. BGD will also assist with onboarding to guarantee the highest quality of service.

## Incident Investigation Support Services
Triaging and validating all the incoming bug reports for a massive protocol, such as Aave, can be highly time-consuming and distracting for the developing entities. Many of the reported issues turn out to be benign. However, at the time of the report, the severity and feasibility of bugs are still unknown. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate them with full seriousness and urgency. We offer to establish an incident investigation support team available 24/7 to support emergency cases. In every incident, we will write a rule that confirms or rejects the existence of a bug and later use it to test the validity of the fix. After every incident, we will update the specifications and incorporate the new tests in the CI.

In past commitments, we have played a crucial role in two critical incident responses. In one case, we concluded that there was no bug in the system. In another case, we identified a missing rule, wrote it, and used it to catch a tricky bug in the suggested fix before the code was deployed.

# Specification

The annual price for the project is $1.5M: $1M is paid in GHO vested linearly over one year, and $500,000 is paid in Aave tokens vested linearly over one year. A 30-day termination is possible after a vote. We reduced the price of $2.7M from last year to reflect the bear market and inlined with the reduced project review capacity.

The Aave and the BGD team will also assist by writing their CVL rules.

# Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.
3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

383,"Simple Summary
This ARC proposes to freeze the Aave V3 Fantom market, allowing users to repay their debts and withdraw but blocking deposits and further borrowing on this market.
After the Harmony bridge event and the recent Nomad bridge exploit, the aave community should consider the risk/benefits of keeping an active Aave V3 market on fantom as this network is dependent of anyswap (multichain) bridge.

The Fantom Aave V3 market did not gain noticeable traction with a current market size of 9M$ and 2.4M$ of open borrowing position, this led to a market generating on average 300$ of fees daily for the protocol (~30$ of daily fees for the Aave treasury)

This market is not currently supported by the Aave Safety module and unless the Aave governance decides otherwise by specific vote, a failure of the main Bridge to Fantom will lead to users with assets worth 0.

This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Fantom. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Famtom, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals, and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts.

Motivation
The unbalanced risk/reward of keeping of Aave V3 market on Fantom is the motivation of this ARC,

The risk of exposing users to potentially losing millions of $ due to causes exterior to intrinsic Aave security is considered not worth the 30$ of daily fees accrued by the Aave treasury.

Anyswap is a team that proved its seriousness and its safety and this proposal is not meant to dismiss their hard work, it is simply considered that the potential risk even if considered small outweighs the benefits of keeping the Aave V3 market on fantom active.

In general, the “EVM-verse” of alternative L1 seems to be currently decided in favor of Avalanche & Polygon.
L2s (Optimism/Arbitrum) currently slowly gaining traction allows Aave to allocate focus on networks presenting fewer vectors of risks in terms of bridges.

Specification
If passed, this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze() function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Fantom. In addition, passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change (disabling supply and borrow) as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Fantom.",bullish

As a team of very passionate ApeCoin DAO & Yuga community members, we want to play our part in the success of ApeChain. And we will not only support it, but even amplify it.

Introducing Blever, a cutting-edge web3 platform combining NFTs with social farming & incentivized content creation. The platform empowers teams to effortlessly bring their creations to life while enjoying unparalleled hype & attention. By leveraging social login and seamless FIAT payments, Blever provides easy access to ApeChain not only for experienced users but also for casual players and retail.

In addition to gaming, you also need fun, culture, memes, and PFPs to make ApeChain appealing and popular. Blever is designed to do just that. We see ourselves as an extended community-driven business development arm. We search for projects, support their launch, and bring them tremendous reach and engagement through social farming. Everyone wins!

With $APE being the native gas token of ApeChain we believe that bringing users/traffic/projects to the chain is probably the single most important thing the DAO can focus on in the near future.

**Driving demand for ApeChain = Driving demand for $APE**

Easy access to ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE Incentives on ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE More use cases on ApeChain → more use cases for $APE ApeChain hype → $APE hype

This is our biggest opportunity and we want to do everything we can with Blever to make the most of it.

Having already invested more than 2 months of our time and resources, we are now looking for funding from the DAO to help us achieve our goal. Let’s make ApeChain a success together

Title: [ARFC] Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum
Date: 2024-05-13
Author: Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)
---

## Summary

The proposal aims to onboard Threshold Network’s tBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum. tBTC is backed one-to-one with Bitcoin.

## Motivation/Background:

tBTC is Threshold’s decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum’s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.

Having recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).

tBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.

Threshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.

### Benefits for Aave:

- Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.
- A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.
- Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.
- Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.
- Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium’s LTIPP.

### Emission schedule

tBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.

### Risks

For tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - [Wallet Generation  Threshold Docs](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation)

The Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:

389,"#### ABSTRACT

Brand New Vision, a digital fashion ecosystem builder, has recently launched a dapp named ME:ID ([id.bnv.me](http://id.bnv.me/)). BNV aims to bring Web3 self-expression at its highest form to the Apecoin ecosystem.

All Apecoin holders will get access to a range of Apecoin gated digital wearables and accessories branded by IPs owned by Yuga Labs in ME:ID which they can use to create personal real time 3D avatars (see example: [001 | ME:ID – Style looks and create your 3D profile](https://id.bnv.me/001)) and enter the Fashion Battle Royale powered by Apecoin.

![Sample Collection based on Apecoin Branding](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/a/acd72c5eddc5b888894db0d1b50f2caad52056b0_2_1380x776.jpeg)

Prize money in Apecoin will be available to attract audiences outside of the ecosystem to encourage them to Ape in. For those who already have strong connections with their digital avatars, this will be a huge opportunity for their digital alter-egos to be seen at a fashion week event in Paris in early 2024.

BNV has previously executed fashion events, activations, catwalk shows and parties during multiple Paris, London and Copenhagen Fashion Weeks.

We believe this will put the spotlight on the fashion relevance of the family of IPs of the Apecoin ecosystem like never before.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

Fashion and culture are 2 sides of the same coin, Apecoin’s mission is to promote all things culture in Web3 and ME:ID is all about visualising culture through the lens of fashion. ME:ID aggregates a wide range of culture in the form of fashion, art, music, dance, sports, memes and anything that helps one express his/her/their primal instincts and visual identities. BNV is confident a well executed competition in the form of battle royale with large bottom up exposure on social media platforms can definitely help further Apecoin DAO’s mission.

This collaboration can attract a wide range of fashion forward hypebeasts and digital-native creators from outside the Apecoin Community to interact and create ME:IDs with a wide range of NFT assets and visual creativity that they possess to inject new energy and new vibes into the Apecoin Ecosystem as well as massively promoting Apecoin ecosystem IPs by taking full advantage of algorithm based social platforms such as Tiktok and IG Reels.

#### OVERALL COST

25,000 $APE to fund the prize pool for the top 3 winning ME:ID profiles

$70,000 USD equivalent in $Ape for organising the IRL fashion event in Paris showing off the ME:IDs of the top 8 finalists of the Fashion Battle Royale as well as notable ME:ID avatars from the entire competition.

391,"#### ABSTRACT

The objective of this proposal is to position ApeCoin as the web3 culture token to power the broader web3 ecosystem. This proposal aims to secure 750,000 APE to acquire NFTs which represent various cultures and also with a certain level of influence in web3. The acquired NFTs will be managed via a community-governed vault, voted by the sister DAO members, and open for $APE holders to utilize the IP with potential grants in $APE in the near future. The initial deployment of $APE for NFT acquisition will be operated and decided by the Committee.

#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

Every step of our proposed approach will prioritize the usage and adoption of $APE

Our 5-step approach to execute this proposal are as follows:

1. Purchase the selected NFTs using the grant in $APE
2. ApeCoin holders owning the governance rights of the usage or moblization of the acquired NFTs (voting through a sister DAO)
3. (Sister DAO Process) ApeCoin DAO will lease these NFT IPs to $APE holders / proposers
4. (ApeCoin DAO or Sister DAO Process) Use $APE to fund the development of these IP utilizations
5. (ApeCoin DAO or Sister DAO Process) Adopt $APE in these products

$APE will be the token that powers the operations and execution of every stage, all the way from initial NFT acquisition to the development of products leveraging these NFT IPs. This will create vital benefits for the ApeCoin ecosystem because it will lead to wider adoption and usage of $APE beyond its current applications.

Sister DAO to be governed by $APE holders with the following decision making:

* Whether specific NFT IPs should be rented to a specific proposer based on the suggested products or projects
* $APE funding for development of the suggested products or projects using the vault's NFT IPs
* Which NFT collections to buy / sell from in the vault’s future NFT acquisitions after the initial acquisition based on this proposal

This sister DAO would operate outside of the main ApeCoin DAO, but still consist of the same membership base with the only requirement being to own 1 $APE.

Supercharge IP utilization within and beyond the APE ecosystem

* This community-run vault will acquire, hold, and empower utilizing a number of NFTs from notable NFT collections across the web3 landscape. Benefits:
  + The first application of the acquired NFT IP to create products / services will set the first example of receiving $APE support to power the broader web3 ecosystem and other projects
  + The NFTs acquired via the vault can be used by the ApeCoin community without having to deploy capital and own the NFTs themselves, however able to utilize the IP to the holders’ preference of projects
  + Open cross-community dialogue and supercharge the educational process of ApeCoin DAO involvement

One of the many benefits of this vault’s sister DAO is its low-barrier entry of owning at least 1 APE to have governance and usage rights in this vault.

#### OVERALL COST

We propose allocating an initial budget of 750,000 ApeCoin from the DAO treasury for acquiring NFTs. The budget will be utilized as such:

**Title:** [ARFC] Add ARB to Arbitrum Aave v3
**Author:** @fig - Flipside Crypto
**Created** : 2023-05-26

---
## Abstract

This proposal is the next step to add ARB to Aave v3 on Arbitrum.

## Summary

Following the successful [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x058f8e69b69a27495ee9796fc6952326d94eb24fe0071050db166d5d5e1da242) to add Aave v3 on Arbitrum, this  proposal progresses the asset listing to the next stage in the Governance cycle, incorporating parameters provided by Risk  Managers.

## Motivation

Adding support for ARB in Arbitrum v3 pools adds greater TVL and user experience to the increasingly popular Aave v3 Arbitrum market - and additional revenue opportunities for Aave.

By enabling borrowing, it allows users and institutions to take a unique position on this Governance token as the network matures and builds a decentralized community.

Furthermore, it more closely aligns the Aave community with Arbitrum and, by extension, Ethereum.

Additionally, it allows for creative uses of ARB received by the DAO to seed initial liquidity.

## Specifications

ARB may be listed with the following risk parameters:

|Parameter|Value|
| --- | --- |
|Isolation Mode|Yes|
|Borrowable|Yes|
|Collateral Enabled|Yes|
|Supply Cap (ARB)|20M|
|Borrow Cap (ARB)|16.5M|
|Debt Ceiling|$14M|
|LTV|50.00%|
|LT|60.00%|
|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|
|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|
|Reserve Factor|20.00%|
|Variable Base|0.00%|
|Variable Slope1|7.00%|
|Variable Slope2|300.00%|
|Uoptimal|45%|
|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|

Thank you to both @ChaosLabs and @Gauntlet for delivering speedy recommendations.

## Disclaimer

The information provided above about ARB is from public sources and Flipside Crypto cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.

The Arbitrum Foundation or Offchain Labs has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and we are doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.

This ARFC has been prepared solely to promote further discussion, evaluate presented risk parameters, and finalize the proposal before heading to the AIP stage.

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Activate and Deploy GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-05-27

---

### **Summary**
This proposal aims to establish a dedicated Safety Module for GHO, Aave's native stablecoin, on Arbitrum, to enhance the security and stability of the Aave Protocol.

The GHO Safety Module (GSM) will be similar to the existing Aave Safety Module (SM), providing an additional layer of protection against shortfall events and incentivizing stakeholders through rewards by using and staking GHO on Arbitrum.

Deploying the GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum aligns with Aave's strategic goals of fostering a secure and scalable environment for its stablecoin. This proposal leverages Arbitrum's technological advantages and financial incentives, setting a solid foundation for GHO's growth and stability.

### **Motivation**

The [GHO Safety Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-safety-module-with-stkgho/15635) was created with the aim of mitigating risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events, thereby fortifying the Aave Protocol’s resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversified the Safety Module’s capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.

Creating a GHO SM on Arbitrum responds to several factors:

1. Scalability and low fees
2. Strong Ecosystem and Liquidity injection

Creating a GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum will ensure support and liquidity for GHO on Arbitrum.

To provide more context, Aave DAO recently received a Long Term Incentive Pilot Program Grant of 750K ARB from Arbitrum DAO, in order to expand GHO into the Arbitrum ecosystem.

The funds would be used as follows:

- 375K ARB distributed over a 12-week period amounts to around 1% additional yield to users. While this could be higher, it will be meaningful enough to make ETH and GHO borrows sufficiently attractive to boost TVL and borrow metrics.
- 375K ARB used for GHO liquidity mining rewards. To target a sufficient size of GHO liquidity on the network, reward rates will need to be similar to mainnet. The GHO Liquidity Committee has used a mix of incentives to keep GHO at peg. We expect that a similar yield will be needed to manage the GHO peg on Arbitrum.

Together, these two uses of the grant funds should increase TVL and borrowing demand on Arbitrum. Arbitrum will be one of the most attractive networks to borrow on Aave due to the borrowing incentives. It will be the most appealing L2 to borrow and use GHO when it goes cross-chain.

Another example is the recent approval by Aave DAO of the [GHO Cross-Chain Launch strategy for the GHO](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2a6ffbcff41a5ef98b7542f99b207af9c1e79e61f859d0a62f3bf52d3280877a) stablecoin, the native asset of the Aave Protocol, beginning with the initial expansion to the Arbitrum network. This expansion will utilize the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).

### **Specification**

1. **Deployment of GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum**:
    - Establish the GHO SM smart contracts on Arbitrum to manage and protect GHO assets.
    - Integrate Chainlink oracles for accurate and reliable price feeds.
2. **Incentive Program**:
    - Utilize ARB incentives to bootstrap GHO liquidity and adoption on Arbitrum.
    - Implement liquidity mining programs and other yield strategies to attract and retain GHO holders.
3. **Merit Incentive Program**:
    - Stakeholders who participate in staking GHO on Arbitrum will be eligible for Merit rewards. The Merit program is designed to incentivize both borrowing and staking GHO. The rewards will enhance user participation and the overall security of the GHO ecosystem on Arbitrum.

Title: [ARFC] Deployment of Aave on zkSync
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-10

---

# **Summary**

The current ARFC proposes deploying Aave V3 on zkSync to leverage the scalability and cost-efficiency of zk-Rollups. By integrating with zkSync, Aave can offer users faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum mainnet. This ARFC seeks governance approval for the deployment of an Aave V3 instance on the zkSync Era L2.

## Motivation

zkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that utilizes zk-Rollups to batch multiple transactions off-chain and submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach significantly enhances transaction throughput and reduces gas fees. Deposit and borrowing activities can greatly benefit from the reduced transaction costs and increased throughput offered by zkSync.

### Benefits of deploying to zkSync

1. **Reduce Gas Fees:** By leveraging zkSync’s efficient transaction processing, users will incur significantly lower gas fees.
2. **Scalability:** zkSync’s high throughput will allow Aave to scale effectively, accommodating more users and transactions without compromising performance.
3. **New Frontier & Opportunities:** This deployment will offer the Aave DAO a new frontier for growth to explore and a new avenue path for GHO, our stablecoin.
4. **Interoperability:** Due to zkSync infrastructure, an Aave V3 deployment in the zkSync Era can benefit other Aave family products, such as Lens on a segregated layer with GHO, making it a mutually beneficial relationship.

## Specification

### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments
1. Aave DAO commits to redistribute to Aave users via liquidity mining, GHO secondary liquidity incentives, safety module deployments, or merit programs any airdrop provided by the zkSync ecosystem.
2. ACI, on behalf of the Aave DAO, will coordinate any liquidity mining campaign on a zkSync Aave V3 deployment.

402,"Summary:

The Celo community is proposing to deploy Curve on the Celo Blockchain. This expansion to Celo will enable Curve to broaden its reach into a new DeFi ecosystem with $7M of additional incentives for Curve users.

Abstract:

Our proposal is to support the Curve community and expansion in a multi-chain world. Celo is a carbon negative mobile-first platform that makes financial dApps and crypto payments accessible to anyone with a mobile phone. Bringing Curve to Celo means enabling millions of people to gain access to more DeFi tools, and helps further Celo’s goal of bringing prosperity to all.

Through the $100M DeFi for the People initiative, the Celo Foundation will provide $7M of incentives in CELO tokens to bring sustainable liquidity to Curve. Stablecoins on Celo will be listed on Curve to provide opportunities for CRV holders to earn trading fees. Additionally, we propose that the Curve community also provides CRV tokens as incentives.

Celo features 2.6M addresses, up to 1.1M daily transaction, and has processed 102M total transactions. Current native stablecoins include cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL with plans to launch several more this year. These are in addition to bridged versions of DAI, USDC, and USDT using multiple bridge instances. DeFi TVL on Celo has reached as high as approximately $1.2B prior to recent market corrections. Additionally, Celo has been chosen by Kickstarter for its upcoming decentralized product (to date, Kickstarter has successfully supported over 214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers) which will attract new users to the ecosystem.

Motivation:

Curve is building the multi-chain future of DeFi. The Celo ecosystem presents a strong partnership due to its global user base, native stablecoin assets, and EVM compatibility. Current multichain DeFi protocols on Celo include Sushi, 0x, Beefy and Pooltogether, which are joined by native protocols such as Moola Market, Ubeswap, and Mobius.

The Celo platform is fully EVM compatible with a few notable improvements:

- Celo has a fast and secure PoS consensus protocol that aggregates validator signatures using the SNARK-friendly BLS12-377 curve. This choice enables mobile friendly SNARK-based light clients such as Plumo, as well as SNARK proofs that can prove asset ownership off-chain.
- Gas can be paid with CELO or ERC20 tokens (that have been whitelisted through Celo’s on-chain governance). This would make it possible for Curve users to pay for transactions with stablecoins (e.g. cUSD or cEUR) enabling a great user experience for novice users.
- The CELO asset supports the ERC20 interface natively, which does away with the need for a wrapped counterpart like WCELO.
- The network includes a decentralized phone verification protocol that can be used by dApps for lightweight sybil resistance and to make it easier for wallets to use hashed phone numbers as identifiers in an interoperable manner. See this in action with Valora.
- The network includes a few stablecoins that have been whitelisted as a gas currency (cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL). These stablecoins are fully algorithmic, with a smart-contract based expansion and contraction platform (called Mento) that is backed by the Celo Reserve. Mento algorithmically adjusts the supply of stablecoins to user demand. The reserve is overcollateralized and currently consists of over $540M in holdings made up by 103.3M CELO, 3.3K BTC, 35.0K ETH, 15.4M DAI, and 83.3K cMCO2.

Specification:

cLabs will work with the Curve team to deploy all necessary smart contracts needed to start Curve pools and provide any additional tooling necessary to manage incentives for the Curve community, as well as work with third party vendors to perform smart contract audits. cLabs will also work to ensure that cross chain bridge options are available for swapping CRV tokens to and from Celo to networks where Curve is present. Celo is EVM compatible and so the deployment is expected to be completed with little to no alterations to the smart contracts.

For:

Curve will add new users from the Celo community and enable millions of people to gain access to DeFi tools through their mobile phone. This in turn will promote Celo’s goal of bringing DeFi to everyday people by driving more liquidity into the Celo ecosystem thereby making DeFi more accessible.

Against:

Not enough interest in the Curve community to deploy and maintain on Celo. Celo’s goal for making DeFi to people through mobile phones does not fit within Curve’s goals.

403,"[cross-posted in the forum for discussion https://gov.0x.org/t/temperature-check-protocol-fee-experiment/983 and in Snapshot for voting ]

Purpose
Gauge community sentiment for a temporary (4-week) elimination of protocol fees to assess the impact on protocol volume

Background
Reference: https://gov.0x.org/t/future-proofing-the-protocol-fee/927

A number of factors have converged over the past nine months that have significantly impacted protocol fee revenue:

1. Sharp increase in Q1 and Q2 due to high gas prices and increased volume of open orderbook (limit order) trades

2. Sharp decrease in Q3 due to lower gas prices (in particular, the explosion of Flashbots and other MEV schemes) and increased competition for open orderbook liquidity

[see chart in forum post]

Going forward as L2s start to gain traction and in the absence of some compelling event, the downward trend is likely to continue. 

Hypothesis
If protocol fees are eliminated (temporarily, in this case), open orderbook volume will increase. Additionally, swap volume could increase as well due to user behavior/loyalty. 

The data gathered from this experiment can be used to inform a tokenomics redesign, which is top-of-mind for protocol stakeholders. 

Note: We could also reduce the fee temporarily rather than eliminating it, but that would provide a weaker signal and not be as useful an experiment.

Other Factors to Consider
Staking performance will be negatively impacted; however, it is already being impacted by the factors described above. 

Voting Options
1. Yes (temporarily eliminate protocol fees on open orderbook trades)
2. No (keep the current fee structure)",bullish

Title: [ARFC]  ACI Phase III - “Ad Astra”
Date: 2024-04-24
Author: MarcZeller - Aave-chan Initiative
---

## Summary:

This ARFC proposes the continuation of the collaboration with the Aave-chan Initiative (ACI) for an additional year, with a proposed budget of 1M GHO.

## Motivation


The ACI has demonstrated significant value to the Aave ecosystem across multiple fronts. The “initiative” launched ~18 months ago is now a team of 8 people strong, including various talents & providing multiple services, contributing to the DAO's success.
This proposal seeks to extend our collaboration for another year.

## ACI services:

The ACI service provider is now an 8-person team offering a variety of services for the Aave DAO. Here’s what we intend to maintain and improve during this proposal engagement:

### Skywards

Skywards has become the default option for the Aave governance as a whole, and the ACI is proud to keep delivering **first-class service to anyone upon simple request**. 

### Dolce Vita

Dolce Vita is the main “boring & invisible”  service of the ACI; “**Great service is often invisible, but bad service is immediately noticeable**” is our motto for Dolce Vita.

Aave DAO revenue is accrued, service provider coordination allows for increased efficiency, and third-party updates and integrations are done **without most community members realizing someone is doing the work in the background**. 

Dolce Vita might be the lesser-known of all the ACI’s services, but we believe it’s actually one of the most important. We’re happy to maintain, improve, and extend Dolce Vita services along with our continued engagement with the DAO.

### “Ad Astra”: (Growth)

We consider Growth and Business Development to be the core of ACI services. We coordinated, contributed to, and created numerous proposals to improve the Aave DAO revenue, and the results are clear. The **Aave DAO has never been as profitable as it is now**, and the **DAO net profits have largely overperformed the market conditions**.

The Aave DAO is the second most profitable DAO, and together, we fully intend **to become the most profitable DAO on earth**.

This part of our work is also made possible thanks to collaboration with key DAO actors in this vertical, **such as TokenLogic and Karpatkey**. We’re glad to work with them every day, and we all have our own domains of expertise, creating value synergies for this DAO.

**Growth and BD are part of ACI’s DNA**. We intend to maintain and extend our contributions in this vertical.

### Representation:

The ACI is now an impactful voice for the DAO. The ACI is known to support and defend the Aave DAO’s **best interests internally and externally**.

We consider that our “chainsaw” arc contributed to making the Aave DAO one of the most efficient and profitable DAOs in the world and to Aave maintaining its leader position in our vertical.

That being said, we fostered numerous synergistic initiatives to build bridges with the community and attract new users: Merit was a large success for GHO growth & Aave market share growth, APE integrated the DAO as an Arbitrum governance player and **contributed to a 750k $ARB LTIP grant** to support GHO and the **ACI represented the DAO across the globe participating, speaking & sponsoring numerous events**.

With this continuation proposal, we intend to remain a strong voice for the DAO and remain active both onchain & offchain in conferences. At the time of writing, we have **confirmed participation at Dappcon, EthCC, and Devcon** for the next few months.

## Specifications

Proposal duration: 365 Days
Proposal Budget: 1M GHO

Note: this proposal is intended to be a continuation of ACI’s previous streams due to governance mandatory delays to avoid a “gap” in ACI’s engagement, if this proposal is favored by aave governance votes, the AIP payload stream duration will be adjusted to reflect an engagement from May 5th, 2024.

## Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.
3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

408,"Summary
Transak was previously integrated with Aave UI(Fiat → aTokens on Aave). The purpose of this proposal is to add it to allow users in over 100+ countries across multiple blockchain networks to buy cryptocurrencies in order to get a yield-earning token in their wallets.

Details -
Background
Transak was on Aave UI. Since Aave migration has happened to IPFS, Transak proposed to be added back on Aave to enable the community to on-ramp on all the networks where Aave v3 is currently deployed.

About Transak
Transak is a single integration for applications to enable fiat-to-crypto on-ramp for a global user base. It does this by providing API-driven fiat payment methods to the on-ramp to 100+ crypto assets and abstracting away the complexity of user KYC, risk monitoring & compliance, payment methods, and customer support.

Goal
To integrate Transak Widget into Aave UI so that users can buy CryptoCurrencies against Fiat currencies using different payment methods on multiple blockchain networks.

The Problem
Unfortunately, to start earning interest on tokens or borrowing funds, users have to obtain their cryptocurrencies beforehand in order to interact with Aave. A user would have to go through as many as three steps before reaching Aave.


![image](ipfs://QmamKu8f4GVDCSmpUwWXV9qBfcFkD8P2TGFDG5sbTLAqpY)

Solution & Benefit to the Aave Community
Allow Aave users to deposit more than 100+ cryptocurrencies with credit/debit card, Apple Pay, bank transfer, or the local payment method in more than 100+ countries and get yield-earning tokens in your wallet in 1 step with only 0.5% commission for bank transfer payments extremely competitively priced.
Transak supports all the networks where Aave v3 is currently deployed and enables Aave users to access a supported DeFi in 1 step through Transak’s 1-click to protocol solution. Now users only need to enter their wallet address and pay through their preferred payment method to use AAVE. Transak’s 1-click to protocol solution hides the blockchain complexity and combines all five transactions into just one step for the user.


![image](ipfs://QmfH9a1SoPBUhYcccrvw8puVpqrP7KeJ8Kn56Z2ViX25xy)

How it Works
Using this integration, the user clicks on the buy Token button on the AAVE website to launch Transak Widget. Transak has its own smart contracts and when users deposit fiat it automatically mints yield-earning tokens and delivers them directly to their wallet. Transak takes all the complexity of what’s going on and makes it simple for the user — fiat in requested cryptocurrency out to the user’s wallet.

title: [ARFC] Aave Robot v1
author: @bgdlabs - BGD Labs (Bored Ghosts Developing)
created: 2023-06-28
---

## Summary

Request approval from the community to move forward Aave Robot v1, the first iteration of a framework and architecture of smart contracts to automate permissionless actions of Aave, like those related to the Aave governance v2; powered by Chainlink Automation.

## How will it work?

A detailed description of the system can be found on the [Aave governance forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-robot-v1/13091), but as summary:
- Multiple `Robot` smart contracts will be deployed, that will contain the logic to 1) understand when a permissionless action on Governance v2 (or cross-chain governance) can be triggered (queueing, execution, cancel) and 2) execute them.
- A `AaveCLRobotOperator` will be deployed on each network, that will allow for the DAO to have ""admin"" control on all the underlying robots, in order to register new ones, cancel or funding them with the LINK required for execution.
- To simplify operational complexity, the maximum gas limit proposed will be close to the maximum allowed by the underlying Chainlink infrastructure. As anybody can top-up LINK on the Aave Robot via a permissionless function on the `AaveCLRobotOperator`, the community could request for external entities to partially or totally cover the execution costs of proposals by using it.
- As in some cases it could be desirable for example to disable automation of a specific proposal and this is not possible with ""slow"" governance procedures, a Robot Guardian role is defined that will be able to 1) disable automation for a certain governance proposal and 2) ""pause"" automation on a specific network.
Both actions are non-invasive, as it only affects the automation system, not the underlying governance system at all.
Initially, BGD will keep the Robot Guardian role.

### Setup flow

For the DAO to activate the system the procedure is simply the following:
1. A technical service provider (BGD in this case) will deploy both the Robot smart contracts and the `AaveCLRobotOperator`, on each supported network.
2. A governance proposal will be submitted to activate and configured those robots, and top them up with LINK from the Aave Collector.

Afterwards, the DAO can register new robots via governance proposal, or manage the registered ones however needed.",bullish
411,"#### ABSTRACT

This AIP is a reconstruction of [AIP-229](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-229-establish-guidelines-for-apecoin-staked-in-protocols-to-be-counted-for-voting-power/11457) to be submitted as separate proposals by each protocol.

The current voting system does not allow ApeCoin staked in protocols, other than [ApeStake.io](https://apestake.io/), to be considered in voting power calculations for ApeCoin DAO governance.

This AIP allows for **ParaSpace** to request Ape Foundation’s assistance in implementing ApeCoin staked for its individual users to count as voting power in ApeCoin DAO governance activities.

**ParaSpace** is a cross-margin lending protocol for full collateralized loans with bundled collateral. In just five months, ParaSpace has achieved impressive results, with up to TVL of $220 million, a leader in the market. We have over 2400 NFTs supplied, over 7,000 users, and $8.3 million in Ape staking. **ParaSpace** aims to become the world's leading universal lending protocol, not only in the NFTFi area but also in financial derivatives and real-world assets. Our vision is to allow users to borrow anything against everything. ParaSpace has many advantages, including auto-compounding, auto-repay to save gas, and maximizing staking rewards. We also offer a variety of pool choices, such as p2pool and p2peer. We provide BNPL services, allowing users to buy blue-chip NFTs and enjoy benefits with 0% down payment and immediate profit generation for Staking. ParaSpace also offers special features such as Rare Trait Boost loan limits. Recently, we have launched Instant Unstake Eth, allowing users to withdraw assets immediately without waiting 7-14 days.

#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

Increased governance voting participation.

415,"## [ARFC-Addendum] Update Boosters for Merit Round 7
## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
## Date: 2024-07-25
---
### Simple Summary
We propose updating Merit parameters and rewarded actions to increase program efficiency for Round 7.

### Motivation
The Aave protocol has maintained and developed its market share in DeFi in a highly competitive landscape thanks to the Merit program. Recent rounds of Merit have been successful, and we aim to build upon this success while adapting to new strategies and market conditions.

Merit aims to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program. Therefore, it needs to be updated and adapted when new strategies can be applied.

### Specification

**Boosters Update**

1. Retain and Expand:
   Expansion of Second Degree Aligned Users Booster: This booster will reward users of Defisaver and **now also Gnosis Safe**, recognizing their importance in the broader DeFi ecosystem and encouraging their integration with Aave.

2. Remove:
   - ""Diversity supporter"" LST boost. This will be replaced by a dedicated boost for the Etherfi Aave market, allowing for more targeted incentives.
   - **GHO minting rewards in favor of StkGHO**. With the recent policy to tap the GHO borrow rate to match the MakerDAO DSR, the cost of minting GHO was decreased significantly, leading to a ""Net"" borrow rate below markets, especially for users also benefiting from the StkAAVE discount. This has made the maintenance of the peg of GHO more difficult as the carry trade opportunity has been seen as attractive for some users. We consider it more efficient to focus Merit on StkGHO for Round 7.


3. New Addition:
   - **Etherfi Aave Market Boost**: A new, dedicated boost will be created to support and incentivize participation in the Etherfi Aave market, recognizing its unique position in the ecosystem This expansion is contingent on Governance approval of its deployment

### Next Steps
1 escalate this [ARFC-Addendum] proposal to a Snapshot vote for formal approval.
2. If [ARFC Addendum] is approved in the Snapshot phase, apply changes to Merit Round 7.

Related Discussion: Our proposal is similar to [Voltz Additional Use Grant](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/should-uniswap-provide-voltz-with-v3-additional-use-grant/15669)

### What is Rage Trade?

[Rage Trade](https://rage.trade) is a new perpetual swap  protocol built using Uniswap v3. Many on-chain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs. However, traders and LPs benefit from v3’s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp.

### Why do we need an additional use grant?

Our proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol. Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3’s code but instead we have built on top of it. Think of Uniswap as our matching engine, and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading. We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswap’s core: leverage trading, leverage LPing, cross-margin, liquidations, and real time funding rates. 

### What changes have we made that require additional use?

We have built libraries to enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates. Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswap’s BUSL protect code (that we require an additional grants use for):

- [SimulateSwap](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/SimulateSwap.sol): This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage. It makes use of Uniswap’s TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries.
- [TickBitmapExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickBitmapExtended.sol): This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswap's TickBitmap, required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract.
- [TickExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickExtended.sol): This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade. They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3.
- [LiquidityPosition](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/LiquidityPosition.sol#L5): This library enables leverage liquidity providing (and the accompanying margin logic). It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so.


 ### How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap?

1. Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3: Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 (not a fork) all additional TVL + trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3.

2. Rage Trade will spend significant R&D resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie: Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 80-20 strategy that composes with Curve’s tricrypto.

3. Liquid & composable on-chain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies: Using perps, Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging. Additionally multi-collateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market. 

### Conclusion

Rage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswap’s value as a protocol. We look forward to discussing our proposal with the Uniswap community and answering questions in the comments below.",bullish
421,"[Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2021-12-16/6646)

## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. In addition, we propose freezing the KNCL reserve.


## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.


## Specification

The recent market downturn on the weekend of December 4th led to the most liquidations on both centralized exchanges and in liquidity protocols in the recent past. Most liquidations on the Aave protocol happened between 4:30 and 5:45 UTC when the price of ETH dropped nearly 13%. Below is a graph of liquidation by collateral and repay asset.
![Liquidations by collateral and repay asset](https://i.imgur.com/gDTtU13.png)
Although volatility for assets is slightly higher, the abundance of liquidity and active market participants is a positive sign for the health of Aave! For example, the total value of CRV (curve dao token) liquidated was large compared to the total collateral used on Aave. Lower LTV, lower liquidation threshold, and higher liquidation bonus protect the protocol from insolvencies. However, multiple liquidations of over 400,000 USD occured in quick succession. This shows ample liquidity for liquidators even in times of high network congestion. These market events provide important data points for measuring tail risk.

For reference, previous analysis of liquidations on Aave from May 2021 can be found here: https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/aave-protocol-liquidation-retrospective-may-2021-67c655fc1b31

Although some assets currently have higher volatility, our analysis shows that it is safe to increase borrowing parameters and decrease liquidation bonus values. Our simulations study price drops and network congestion more extreme than was seen last week, and slippage and liquidity considerations have improved.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAT Loan To Value     | 70%     | 75%     |
| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |
| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |
| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 60%     |
| REN Liquidation Threshold     | 60%     | 65%     |
| SNX Loan To Value    | 30%     | 40%     |
| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 55%     | 60%     |
| SUSHI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |
| ZRX Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |

**Freezing KNCL**
The KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://www.notion.so/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://www.notion.so/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.

Considering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.

This philosophy is rooted in our belief that progress in the DeFi space is a collective journey, propelled by shared knowledge and collaboration.

**Empowering Autonomy:** Central to our ethos is the goal of minimizing dependency on any single service provider, including ourselves. We envision a future where the Aave DAO is equipped with the knowledge and tools to independently manage risk. To this end, we are dedicated to open-sourcing our data pipelines and models, ensuring that our contributions have a lasting impact and support the DAO's journey towards self-reliance. Our objective is clear: to build a foundation that not only serves immediate needs but also empowers future generations of the Aave community.

## Our approach as a risk provider

Our focus is on providing clear, actionable risk management insights that enhance understanding of the interplay between growth opportunities and potential risks. Through transparent methodologies and open communication, we commit to empowering the Aave DAO with the knowledge needed for informed decision-making, thereby fostering a proactive, risk-aware community.

Our mission is aligned with the evolving priorities of the Aave DAO and its stakeholders. Whether the focus shifts towards GHO, Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), or other areas of interest, Allez Labs is dedicated to adapting our resources to meet these needs. By maintaining a flexible approach, we ensure that while we concentrate on the DAO's current priorities, we also keep a vigilant eye on the broader risk landscape. Our goal is to provide targeted, relevant contributions that not only address immediate concerns but also strengthen Aave's resilience and strategic position in the long term.

# Proposal

Allez Labs proposes to partner with Aave DAO, leveraging our extensive experience in risk management and our commitment to open-source principles to enhance the protocol's stability and growth across Aave V3 and GHO. Our mission is to protect Aave from a broad spectrum of risks through employing a holistic strategy that not only focuses on mitigating immediate threats through qualitative and quantitative modeling, but also on embedding long-term risk management solutions into the protocol's design. With a focus on transparency, community engagement, and open-source development, we pledge to empower the Aave community with the knowledge and tools necessary for informed decision-making, fostering a more robust, inclusive, and thriving ecosystem.

## Scope

**Aave V3**

* **Asset Listing Support:** We will provide analysis for new asset listings on all V3 markets for all assets that pass the Temp Check stage.
* **New Deployment Risk Assessments:** Aave V3 is now active on 10 chains and we anticipate the DAO will vote to explore additional networks in the upcoming year. As such, we will provide market risk and liquidity assessments for new deployment proposals as well as initial assets and parameterizations for these new networks.
* **Ad Hoc Parameter Recommendations:** Recognizing Chaos Labs' effective and proactive adjustments to market parameters, Allez Labs will offer supplementary analyses and strategic recommendations for V3 market parameters, targeting enhanced ecosystem stability and refined risk management.
* **LRT Listing Framework:** As Liquid Restaking Tokens become increasingly popular, Allez Labs will create and publish a LRT listing framework with support from the greater Aave community to best onboard and manage these assets within the Aave ecosystem.

**GHO**

* **Aave V3 Facilitator Parameterization:** This includes parameter recommendations to manage market and liquidity risks, while ensuring GHO’s competitiveness. Parameters to be tuned are borrow cap, interest rates, and stkAAVE discounts.
* **GHO Peg Stability:** Our team will develop strategies to minimize peg volatility and drive GHO growth through renewed trust in GHO’s stability, allowing for increased GHO borrow caps. We will work with the GHO Liquidity Committee to supply relevant GHO peg analysis and data.
* **GSM Parameterization:** Adjust the GHO Stability Module parameters to most effectively support GHO’s peg.
* **Support Cross-Chain GHO Rollout:** Allez Labs will conduct analyses to assess and mitigate risks associated with the cross-chain expansion of GHO, guided by the initiative and framework set by Aave Labs.

**Protocol**

* **Risk Steward:** Take on the role as the second service provider on the risk steward multistig.
* **Incident Response:** As needed, when emergency security threats arise, we will provide guidance, threat and impact analyses in order to mitigate the threats.
* **Automated Risk Management:** We will work with other risk providers and stakeholders to begin development of risk parameter automation strategies to streamline the DAO’s risk process where the trade offs are clear. These may include:
  * Automation around WETH interest rate parameters which are primarily driven by LST yield
  * Automation around Supply and Borrow caps for new deployments

### Roadmap

* **Immediate:** Ad hoc risk parameter recommendations for V3 Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Avalanche markets, support for GHO related items, assume risk stewardship responsibilities, new deployment risk assessments.
* **Short-Term Objectives (First 3 Months):** Active risk parameter recommendations on GHO and all remaining active V3 markets, support for GSM parameterization and remaining GHO items. Risk analysis work for cross-chain GHO.
* **Med-Term Objectives (Following 3 Months):** Automated risk management development report, LRT listing framework publication.

### Requested Budget

For the operations of Allez Labs over a 6-month period a budget of $400,000 is proposed. This budget will enable us to cover operational costs including, but not limited:

* Legal fees
* Node and data provider subscriptions
* Cloud costs
* Salaries, and hiring of additional analysts and developers as needed

### Terms

* 6-month engagement
* 400,000 GHO streamed linearly throughout the engagement

## Evaluation Metrics

From the DAO’s experience with service providers, inspired by BGDs proposal, the following metrics are good measures of performance:

* Monthly recaps of Allez Labs’ contributions to the DAO with tracking of the progress on the scope and various contributions.
* Provable participation and/or delivery of the projects described in the scope.
* Direct or indirect participation in projects of other fields of contribution.
* Feedback from other contributors and DAO members.
* Direct and transparent engagement with the DAO via this governance forum.

## Next Steps

1. Engage with the community and other service provides to refine the proposal
2. Escalate the proposal strengthened by stakeholders’ feedback to ARFC
3. Execution upon approval
4. Immediate support for GHO, Aave V3 Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism and Avalanche.
5. Support for all Aave V3 markets along the timeline proposed.
