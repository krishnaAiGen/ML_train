22," This document outlines a proposal for an update to the Safety Module in Aave, focusing on incentives management strategy. The proposed changes aim to grow the Total Value Locked (TVL) and coverage, improve liquidity for Aave tokens, and optimize voting power and incentives.

Key points include:
- With current market metrics and estimated TVL, the expected APRs on Aura are achieved, along with a reduction in average insurance cost from 30,02% to 17,23% and an increase in cover from $119M to $175M.
- The strategy will also help grow SM (TVL & Cover) and improve liquidity for Aave tokens, allowing other incentive budgets for GHO liquidity or liquidity mining on StakedATokens to be used for the same strategy.
- Voting options include YAE (Update the incentives management strategy), NAE (Continue classic liquidity mining), and ABSTAIN.
- The Llama, an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem, is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.
- References are provided to related proposals in the Aave governance forum.

65," The provided tables represent two proposed interest rate models (Curve #1 and Curve #2) for a decentralized lending and borrowing platform like Aave. Both curves aim to address the over-approximation of an existing 10,000% interest curve by reducing the Slope2 parameter.

   Curve #1 focuses on setting a higher optimal utilization rate and a maximum APY that reduces the potential for extended periods at 100% utilization while maintaining a more gradual increase in interest rates above the optimal utilization rate.

   Curve #2 adjusts its parameters to have a maximum APY similar to the intended APY in AIP-26, resulting in a higher likelihood of periods at 100% utilization compared to curve #1. This curve is designed to mimic the intended APY mentioned in AIP-26 more closely.

   The charts show how the APY changes based on the utilization rate for both proposed curves. As the utilization rate increases, so does the APY, with significant jumps occurring around the optimal utilization rate (80% in this case). Both curves have a maximum effective APY of 10151.40%, which is derived from the provided Slope2 parameter and the given optimal utilization rate.

1. Granting funds in $HAUS to increase the stability of the token price.
2. Utilizing $HAUS for more than just voting within the DAOhaus ecosystem, with future plans to use it as a coordination mechanism.
3. Supporting the utility and value of contributor compensation denominated in $HAUS.

The platform does not rely on external oracles and has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence. The most used smart contracts are instances of the MolochV2.1 contract framework, which was audited, and none of the contracts are upgradable. There have been no hacks to date.

DAOhaus aims for decentralization and has made organizational design choices to avoid concentrating power. Key aspects include:

- Non-upgradable on-chain assets distributed across multiple entities.
- Governance power over key on-chain assets is distributed among various DAOs, with no single DAO controlling more than 10.5% of voting shares.
- Centralization vectors are being addressed by migrating the entire stack to decentralized infrastructure.

The total net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. An additional 1.7M USDC, 0.5M DAI, and 0.75M USDT from Polygon will also be transferred to Ethereum.

The proposal aims to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required, and to move Aave in the right direction. The tasks to be performed on Ethereum include depositing 1M DAI into Aave v3, migrating aUSDT, aDAI, and other assets from Aave v2 to v3, swapping certain assets to GHO, and bridging USDC, DAI, and USDT from Polygon to Ethereum.

The funds available to support new expenses after implementing the proposal will include more than 1.25M of aEthUSDT, more than 1.8M of aEthDAI, more than 1.5M of GHO, and more than 1.0M of aEthUSDC.

The next steps involve reaching consensus on ARFC stage, escalating to ARFC snapshot stage if consensus is reached, and if the outcome is YAE, escalating to AIP stage. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalized for the next 6 months. A publication relating to the DAO's overall budget allocation will be shared during Q4 2023.

1. It defines two interfaces for smart contracts, one for a stable pool (`stable_pool`) and another for a linear pool (`linear_pool`). These interfaces are used to interact with specific functions of these contracts.

2. It also defines three addresses: `GAUNTLET_FEE_SETTER`, `GAUNTLET_AMP_SETTER`, and `BALLERS_MULTISIG`. These addresses represent accounts that have certain roles in the system.

3. It defines two more addresses, `AAVE_LINEAR_FACTORY` and `STABLE_PHANTOM_FACTORY`, which are factories for creating linear pools on the Aave and Phantom protocols respectively.

4. The script then creates roles for each function that can be granted to the specified accounts using the `authorizer` contract. It does this by calling the `grantRoles` function of the `authorizer` contract, passing in an array of role IDs (which are created using the `roleId` function) and the address of the account that should receive these roles.

   - In step 1, it grants the `setSwapFeePercentage` role to the `GAUNTLET_FEE_SETTER` for the stable pool.
   - In step 2, it grants the `startAmplificationParameterUpdate` and `stopAmplificationParameterUpdate` roles to the `GAUNTLET_AMP_SETTER` for the stable pool.

284," The summary is as follows:

Balancer V2 liquidity mining will operate in three tiers: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Tier 1 pools will be voted on by governance on a recurring basis, while Tier 2 and Tier 3 pools will be strategically assigned by the Ballers Committee based on community sentiment. The Ballers Committee is a group of active and dedicated members of the Balancer community who have contributed significantly to the protocol. Any engaged individuals in the community can potentially join the committee through elections by fellow community members.

The transition from V1 to V2 will take approximately 8 weeks, with BAL liquidity mining allocations incrementally migrated to V2 on a weekly basis during this period. The weekly BAL distribution will remain constant at 145,000 BAL per week throughout the migration process.

The Ballers Committee aims to provide quick responses according to market conditions and avoid extensive overhead on BAL governance. However, it's important to note that there are potential risks associated with this small group of individuals, such as centralization risks and collusion. The community will constantly assess the participation and decision-making abilities of Ballers, and they can be elected or dismissed by BAL holders through Snapshot votes.

Certain pools may be allocated more than one slot by the committee to tentatively match the APY of specific pools on V1. All community members will always have the ability to signal their support for liquidity mining inclusion for T2 and T3 pools in order to guide the committee.

The upgrade to Balancer V2 is expected to increase gas efficiency, creating a natural incentive for project teams to drive liquidity to Balancer due to its competitive conditions for trading, namely lower gas costs. Some competitors don't offer liquidity incentives at all and still have sufficient liquidity for the long-tail of assets.

431,"1. The gas reimbursement amount depends directly on the number of eligible swaps, with 130,000 gas for one swap, 220,000 gas for two swaps, 300,000 gas for three swaps, and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.

2. The estimated gas price is the median from the last few blocks according to the `getGasPrice()` function from the web3 provider, providing a good approximation of the actual trade block's median gas price.

3. The estimated BAL/ETH price is queried from an 80/20 BAL/WETH pool, acting as a real-time oracle and not used to compute the actual award amount.

4. The final result displayed to the user is the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for the particular trade, assuming funds are still available in the budget, along with a USD estimate using CoinGecko's API for BAL/USD price.

5. At dispersal time, the number of eligible swaps is determined, and the gas reimbursement amount depends on this count. The actual gas price is the median from the block containing the trade, with artificially low-price transactions filtered out. The actual BAL/ETH price is queried from CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

6. The only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are minor: the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block, and the 80/20 BAL/WETH price may not perfectly match CoinGecko’s BAL/ETH price.

7. The user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time, improving the overall user experience and potentially attracting more traders to the campaign.

Overnight.fi is an asset management protocol that specializes in delta-neutral strategies and offers USD+, a 100% collateralized stablecoin.

The Overnight Steady Accord is an implementation of Overnight Pulse that relies on USD+ for yield. In March 2023, the gauge for Overnight Pulse pool on Optimism was enabled following a positive vote. The proposal aims to re-enable the gauge after changes to its codebase.

Overnight Pulse has been successful in driving volumes and TVL (Total Value Locked) to Balancer’s ecosystem, with up to 7M TVL and daily trading volumes ranging from 300-500K on Optimism. The yield was consistently around 12-14% APR, with the majority generated by USD+ rather than rewards.

2. Utilizing $HAUS for more than just voting within the DAOhaus ecosystem, with future plans to use it as a coordination mechanism.
3. Supporting the utility and value of contributor compensation denominated in $HAUS.

The platform does not rely on external oracles and has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence. The most used smart contracts are instances of the MolochV2.1 contract framework, which was audited, and none of the contracts are upgradable. There have been no hacks to date.

DAOhaus aims for decentralization and has made organizational design choices to avoid concentrating power. Key aspects include:

1. Granting funds in $HAUS to increase the stability of the token price.
2. Utilizing $HAUS for more than just voting within the DAOhaus ecosystem, with future plans to use it as a coordination mechanism.
3. Supporting the utility and value of contributor compensation denominated in $HAUS.

The platform does not rely on external oracles and has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence. The most used smart contracts are instances of the MolochV2.1 contract framework, which was audited, and none of the contracts are upgradable. There have been no hacks to date.

DAOhaus aims for decentralization and has made organizational design choices to avoid concentrating power. Key aspects include:

- Non-upgradable on-chain assets distributed across multiple entities.
- Governance power over key on-chain assets is distributed among various DAOs, with no single DAO controlling more than 10.5% of voting shares.
- Centralization vectors are being addressed by migrating the entire stack to decentralized infrastructure.

   Summary: This proposal suggests a temporary reduction in the LTV of DAI and sDAI to 0% across all chains due to MakerDAO's allocation of a significant portion of potential DAI backing to a new, riskier asset. The proposal also aims to align the LTs and LTVs across different chains.

   Key Points:
   - Decrease DAI and sDAI LTV to 0% temporarily.
   - Gradual decrease in LT by 1 percentage point for every 50M in D3M exposure, with a maximum reduction of 12 percentage points.
   - Standardization of LTs and LTVs across different chains to minimize the impact of LT reductions on the likelihood of liquidations.
   - The proposal prioritizes a risk-averse strategy considering minimal revenues generated from collateral usage.

   Specification: Provides a detailed table showing the current expected LTV and LT for each chain, and the recommended LTV and LT (first and last stage) based on the proposed changes.

   Next Steps:
   1. Gather community feedback and consensus on the proposed changes.
   2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.
   3. If successful, escalate to the AIP (Aave Improvement Proposal) stage for implementation.

739," The text discusses a proposal by Pickle Finance to collaborate with Balancer Protocol, aiming to enhance the utility of deposits for Balancer LPs and the overall utility of Balancer's Gauge system. This collaboration is expected to create synergies through an easy mechanism for aggregating `veBAL` boosts and benefits for prospective Balancer LPs. The proposal includes incentives for those who vote to whitelist Pickle and join early, with around 2-3% of the PICKLE supply allocated for Balancer Brinery incentives. The design involves a seamless user experience for joining `veBAL` through a system called the Brinery, which guarantees liquidity for Pickle's `veBAL` derivative and provides rewards to users.

750," The text presents a proposal for whitelisting a gauge for a pool on Balancer.fi, specifically a FOLD/WETH pair. The proposal is from Manifold Finance, a platform that provides access to high-value transaction pools through their infrastructure called SecureRPC. They aggregate multiple endpoints and mining pools. The motivation behind this proposal is to deepen liquidity as current onchain liquidity is low but volume incentives and bribes have been high in recent days.

The governance model of Manifold Finance uses an elected dictator system, where FOLD token holders delegate control to one address (the dictator) in exchange for rewards. The protocol fees are collected in a vault and distributed over time to prevent MEV attacks. They also maintain a multisig address for voting in governance proposals of other DAOs, which will be migrated to a vault-based permissive action list structure.

The pool in question has seen significant volume since its activation and currently offers a high APR. The proposal includes links to Manifold Finance's website, documentation, GitHub, forum, and Twitter for further information. However, it also mentions potential centralization risks such as the use of a centralized service for governance discussions and the presence of certain account addresses with large amounts of FOLD tokens.

794," Title: Balancer Governor Note Analysis Proposal

Objective & Success Metrics:
1. Surfacing on-chain metrics and protocol developments: Provide data-driven research reports to inform stakeholders about the economic, financial, and social health of Balancer. The success of this objective will be measured by the number of stakeholders reached and engaged through Messari's channels, Bloomberg Terminal, S&P Global Capital IQ, and Refinitiv.
2. Growth: Increase the exposure and professionalization of Balancer to major funds, banks, financial service companies, and large corporations worldwide. The success will be measured by the number of users consuming the information and acting on it, driving meaningful activity to the protocol.

Key Features:
1. Qualitative Analysis: In-depth analysis of governance design, structure/process, quorum, and exploration of governance opportunities. Highlight contentious proposals or noteworthy governance events.
2. Proposal Analysis: Provide a 1500-3000 word proposal-specific analysis to educate stakeholders on the impacts of important DAO proposals.

Retainer for a Balancer Governor Note:
- $80k total budget for four quarterly reports, at least one tweet on each report, and an AMA with the DAO on SP calls about quarterly take-aways and inspiration for new analysis.
- Funds will be used for research, data science and engineering, and distribution efforts.

930,"1. Summary:
   The proposal aims to increase the Uoptimal (utilization optimal) from 90% to 92% for USDC, USDT, and DAI on Aave V3 Ethereum. This adjustment is motivated by the surge in stablecoin supply and demand, aiming to enhance capital efficiency in the market.

   - Key points:
     - Increase Uoptimal from 90% to 92% for USDC, USDT, and DAI on Aave V3 Ethereum.
     - The proposal is supported by empirical data showing minimal leverage employed against stablecoins, a healthy distribution of supplied assets, and consistent utilization rates above the current Uoptimal.

  2. Motivation:
     - Enhance capital efficiency in the market due to the surge in both supply and demand in stablecoin markets.
     - Align rates with market demand by raising the optimal utilization (UOptimal) from 90% to 92%.

  3. Historical Stablecoin Utilization as Collateral:
     - Analyzing the proportion of supplied stablecoins utilized as collateral to evaluate feasibility of increasing UOptimal.
     - Minimal leverage employed against stablecoins overall, with only $1.8 million worth of collective USDC, USDT, and DAI collateral seized through liquidations over the last 90 days (representing just 0.1% of all currently supplied USDT, USDC, and DAI).

  4. Account Distribution:
     - Examining the distribution of supplied stablecoin assets to ensure ample liquidity for suppliers to withdraw their supply according to Uoptimal.
     - Majority of supplied accounts employing zero debt, resulting in an infinite health factor.

  5. Historical Utilization Rate:
     - The utilization rate has consistently remained above the current Uoptimal by approximately 0.5% to 2%.
     - Yield convergence is observed at a 91.5% to 92% utilization rate, considering the current slope1 value of 6%.

  6. Recommendations:
     - Increase UOptimal to 92% for USDC, USDT, and DAI on Aave V3 Ethereum.
     - This adjustment aims to maintain market competitiveness and reduce volatility in the stablecoin market.",3.8229060365805716,neutral

1036," DAOhaus is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that operates within the Ethereum blockchain, focusing on facilitating ecosystem grants and utilization of its native token $HAUS as a coordination mechanism. The key activities of DAOhaus include:

1. Granting funds in $HAUS to increase the stability of the token price.
2. Utilizing $HAUS for more than just voting within the DAOhaus ecosystem, with future plans to use it as a coordination mechanism.
3. Supporting the utility and value of contributor compensation denominated in $HAUS.

The platform does not rely on external oracles and has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence. The most used smart contracts are instances of the MolochV2.1 contract framework, which was audited, and none of the contracts are upgradable. There have been no hacks to date.

DAOhaus aims for decentralization and has made organizational design choices to avoid concentrating power. Key aspects include:

- Non-upgradable on-chain assets distributed across multiple entities.
- Governance power over key on-chain assets is distributed among various DAOs, with no single DAO controlling more than 10.5% of voting shares.
- Centralization vectors are being addressed by migrating the entire stack to decentralized infrastructure.

The front end hosting is currently centralized, but user assets remain secure on the blockchain.

3. The Alchemix DAO multisig and timelock wallet is the administrator for the alUSD token, with the ability to grant and revoke other contracts the minter role. All minting is currently handled by the alchemist.sol contract, but new contracts will also be granted the minting permissions upon launch of version two.
4. The alUSD price oracle will be served via Chainlink.
5. After a forum RFC and community sentiment snapshot vote pass, Alchemix will push a PR with the necessary payloads to the Aave GitHub adding alUSD to the assets list.
6. Proposed parameters for alUSD: Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo, Base LTV As Collateral: 0, Liquidation Threshold: 0, Liquidation Bonus: 0, Borrowing Enabled: true, Stable BorrowRate Enabled: true, Reserve Decimals: 18, Reserve Factor: 20%.
7. The contract was deployed on February 27, 2021, with 49,594 transactions and 1328 token holders.
8. Social channels data: Twitter - 40.2k followers, Discord - 7.5k members, Medium - 1.7k followers.
9. Voting options: YES - enable alUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave, NO - do not enable alUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave.",-25.414691943127966,bearish
1070," The text discusses a proposal for introducing a new asset, GHO, on the Aave Protocol.
