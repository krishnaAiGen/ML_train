5,5,5,2020-09-04 08:03:45+00:00,sushi," Title: Proposal for Integration of SushiSwap on Solana's Serum Platform

   Background: Solana, a fast blockchain, supports over 50k transactions per second (tps) without sharding and costs approximately $0.00002 per transaction. Serum, an on-chain DeFi ecosystem built on Solana, recently launched its DEX. This proposal is submitted by EcoSerum, a Serum node, and not related to FTX. The proposer, Sam Bankman-Fried, has exposure to both SRM and SUSHI but has not been involved in the development of Sushi.

   Proposal: The Sushi community is invited to build out support for Sushiswap on Solana. Sushi rewards will be distributed proportionally to the Total Locked Value (TLV) in each Ethereum and Solana/Serum based Sushiswap, or fixed to each pool. The Sushi AMM will share liquidity and volume with the Serum orderbook by sending bids/offers into the associated Serum orderbook to simulate the curve. This allows the Sushi AMM to access Serum's orderbook liquidity. FTX and sollet.io are developing bridges from ERC20 to SPL (Solana token) Sushi, with Sushi also able to compose with a borrow/lending protocol on Serum for margin trading.

   Rewards: EcoSerum offers 50k SRM for contributions beyond the initial setup and 1 locked MegaSerum (1 million Serum) for contributions between 1-5. These rewards are locked for 1-7 years, with full lockup until Aug 1, 2021, and a linear unlock over the following 6 years. The rewards are intended for the Sushi community to use as they see fit. Additional rewards of 20k SRM for contributions beyond the initial setup and another 10k for contributions between 1-5 will be given to the building team.

   Timeline: The goal is to roll out pieces of this within a month, with completion before the end of 2020. Work is not expected to start in earnest until after the Sushiswap migration is complete.",bullish,4.562,2020-09-04 00:00:00+00:00,5.773,5.773,2020-09-04 00:00:00+00:00,0.265453748355984,3.205666666666666,-0.297311120853427,small

These stores sell exclusively recycled or second-hand products, locally produced to minimize long-distance shipping. Artists submit designs for these stores, and each design includes a production timeline. The Swag Store serves as a hub for recycling artists to exchange ideas and share sustainable production methods.

Anyone can create a Swag Store, controlled by one or multiple addresses or DAOs. It has its own governance token, the Swag Store Token (SST), distributed via a bonding curve. SST holders review applications and ensure sustainability rules are followed.

A project incubator called mylife+ was created, with its token serving as a proof of contribution token. New tokens get minted based on a price curve for contributions to mylife+ projects that benefit the planet and people. The Swag Store is a mylife+ project, and SST is bonded to another token, moos.

Contributors to the Swag Store development receive SST tokens based on their contribution, with an option to choose payment in either the project token or from the funding pool (capped at $200). Users can also buy SST tokens to fund the pool. The more users preferring cash over SST, the more SST can be bought.

The Swag Store will be built using Flutter and Aragon for governance. All contributions will be visible on GitHub, with Google Spreadsheet initially monitoring the proof of contribution token minting and distribution.

Artists worldwide can submit designs for community-voted products made from second-hand or repaired materials. Disputes are resolved through the Aragon court. As a customer, you can choose your preferred design, see local artists with crypto security deposits, and pay via smart contract (automatically converted into USDC). The artist then creates the product and receives payment once delivered. A portion of the funds also goes to the community store.

   Summary: The proposal aims to establish a gauge for inETHx, the Restaked Token dedicated to ETHx, within Ethereum. InceptionLRT is an isolated Liquid Restaking protocol for Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs). Its core feature is the issuance of Isolated Liquid Restaking Tokens (iLRTs) for each restaked LST, which can be traded and used in DeFi protocols without affecting the underlying LSTs. The goal is to increase liquidity for inETHx, supporting its integration into various DeFi protocols.

   Key Features:
   - Governance by ING holders who influence the protocol's direction and policies.
   - Incentive Allocation through gauge weight voting, directing incentives towards preferred liquidity.
   - Rate Provider for inETHx as an Oracle.
   - Regular security audits to ensure user fund safety.
   - A decentralized system with independent node operators powering growth and development, as outlined in the InceptionLRT Litepaper.

2. The estimated gas price for display purposes is the median from the last few blocks according to the `getGasPrice()` function from the web3 provider, providing a good approximation of the median of the actual trade block.

3. The estimated BAL/ETH price for display purposes is queried from the 80/20 BAL/WETH pool on Balancer Exchange, acting as a real-time oracle and not used to compute an actual award amount.

4. The user will see the final result of #1-3: the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for this particular trade, assuming there are still funds left in the budget, along with a USD estimate for completeness.

5. At dispersal time (computed by open source mining scripts):
   - Determine the number of eligible swaps, where an eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the whitelist.
   - The actual gas price is the median from the block containing the trade, with artificially low-price transactions filtered out.
   - The actual BAL/ETH price is queried from the CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

6. The UI changes are still being finalized, but a mockup can be found in the provided image.

7. Potential sources of error between the estimate and the actual award include variations in the median gas price from the last few blocks and differences between the 80/20 BAL/WETH price and CoinGecko's BAL/ETH price, but these should be relatively small.

   Proposed by: $1500Badger, with feedback from community, Badger core team, and Balancer team.

   Objective: To impose regulations on graviAURA LPs to better support BadgerDAO, BalancerDAO graviAURA holders, and LPrs by preventing overvoting in gauges with 10% or more of the total vote weight. The excess vote weight will be used to vote for core pools based on bribe distribution.

   Key Points:
    - GraviAURA's excess vote weight will be used to vote for Balancer core pools, driving emissions to pools earning the highest fees.
    - This alignment with market forces is ideal compared to voting for specific pools in an ever-changing landscape.
    - The regulations will expire after 3 months to allow for more complete governance as more data becomes available.

This new pool will combine various syrup pool rewards, a portion of CAKE emissions, and platform revenue share. The goal is to provide users with attractive APR returns, reduce CAKE emissions, and promote long-term holding.

The new pool will work by pooling resources, offering diverse APR returns, reducing CAKE emissions with substitution by other project tokens and stable coin earnings, and promoting growth of other projects on the platform. It will also auto-compound CAKE earnings but not syrup rewards or stable coins.

This change is expected to positively impact the price of CAKE by moving towards a deflationary model, increasing scarcity and attractiveness, and driving more investor participation due to its flexibility.

The model reveals that 50% of outstanding DAI is on ""long"" maturity (above 3-months), which aligns with the assumption that a portion of DAI should always be easily unwindable. However, it also shows that the short-term front of DAI maturity is quite volatile, with more than 20% DAI having a maturity below one day and up to 40% over 1-week.

The text outlines potential solutions to manage these fluctuations, such as automating money markets D3M withdrawal when liquidity gets low, using held ETH or other major crypto-assets to source liquidity on money markets, generating yield from PSM assets, partnering with other stablecoin issuers for bilateral credit lines, and utilizing tokenized treasury Bonds.

The text also acknowledges known limitations of the model, such as not taking into account circular DAI, unequal risk of outflow in different smart contracts, considering smart wallets as smart contracts but possibly behaving like EOA (Externally Owned Account), and assuming a business-as-usual context without strong defiance of DAI during market crashes.

In conclusion, the text proposes a transparent and reproducible methodology for analyzing DAI maturity profiles and suggests maintaining at least 50% of outstanding DAI in medium-term maturity assets (unwindable within 1-year), 40% unwindable within a week, and 20% unwindable within a day.

The RwaToken contract is a simple implementation of the ERC20 token standard with three functions: transfer, transferFrom, and approve.

The RwaConduit contract has one function, push(), which can be called by anyone with a current MKR balance and holds transitory funds. However, for centrifuge assets, a different contract (the centrifuge manager) acts as the compliant RwaConduit. The MIP21 construction has low technical risk but there may be unknown technical risks in the details of tinlake liquidations.

The ERC20 functions of the RwaToken are implemented to industry standard, but do not mitigate the allowance race-condition or use a SafeMath library. The core functions of the contracts are very limited and only governance or trusted addresses can lock, free, draw, or wipe Dai in the RwaUrn.

The ERC20 token contract does not inherit other contracts. The RwaToken file has an SHA-1 hash of df9d2a7f8f594fced88b457aa003100c347ace31 and the RwaConduit file is not used for centrifuge assets, but rather the centrifuge manager contract acts as a compliant RwaConduit.

- **PEEL**: The total supply is 7,500,000 PEEL, and it will be distributed over a period of 60 days starting shortly after the Initial Farm Offering (IFO) ends. The rewards per block are 4.340 PEEL. For the first 5 days, only users with an active PancakeSwap Profile can stake in the IFO Syrup Pool. After that, there is no requirement for a PancakeSwap Profile. The maximum stake per wallet is 100 CAKE for the first 5 days, then unlimited thereafter to ensure high APY for all participants.

- **SHELL**: The total supply is 155,000,000 SHELL, and it will also be distributed over a period of 60 days starting shortly after the IFO ends. The rewards per block are 89.699 SHELL. Similar to PEEL, for the first 5 days, only users with an active PancakeSwap Profile can stake in the IFO Syrup Pool. After that, there is no requirement for a PancakeSwap Profile.

To host these Syrup Pools, PancakeSwap will provide PEEL-BUSD and SHELL-BUSD farms with specific CAKE rewards. The PEEL farm will have 2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours and thereafter 1x CAKE rewards. The SHELL farm will have 0.5x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours and thereafter 0.1x CAKE rewards.

   Team: The team includes experienced smart contract writers, web3 application builders, DAO designers, and legal experts.

   Funding: The proposal requires 200 ANT for Design & Research and 300 ANT for Build & Ship. The funds will be used to reimburse the team members for their time spent on researching, designing, and building the disputable escrow service.

The Gitbook will consist of sections such as Introduction to Aragon, Aragon Product Stack, Explanation of the structure of the AN DAO, and How to get involved.

The initiative is led by Renzo D5#3503 and luizfernando#1966, who are Cohort 1 Aragon Ambassadors. The Gitbook will help onboard people to AN DAO as the primary support and information source for the development and application of DAO.

The funding will cover research, collaboration, strategic planning, content development, initial operational expenses, and contributor rewards over a three-month period. The handbook is expected to be delivered by 31 March 2022.

The core token, XVS, governs the protocol and captures its primary value. A Venus Vault has been established to distribute staking rewards, ensure equal benefits and responsibilities for XVS holders, and capture most of the system's income.

XVS deposited in the vault receives staking rewards, voting rights, and income distributions. Deposits are subject to a 7-day unlock period, cannot be used as collateral for borrowing, and may contribute up to 10% during a risk event if the Venus risk fund is insufficient.

VRT can also be deposited in the Vault to earn an APY of 3%. After a 12-month transition period, undistributed VRT tokens will be burned. The incentive policies related to XVS deposits have changed with the launch of the Venus vault.

The Venus Vault mechanism improves the system's anti-risk ability and distributes staking rewards. All income is first deposited into Venus’s treasury account, with potential sources being interest reserve and liquidation fees. Income distribution ratios can be adjusted based on risk assessment.

VRT has two primary uses: direct exchange to XVS at a 1:12000 ratio or deposit in the Vault to earn 3% APR. After a 360-day period, neither redemption nor income distribution will be available, and VRT will no longer have practical uses.

Regulatory scrutiny on DeFi, given Maker's role as a major player, could have substantial effects on its growth. Potential threats include securities and banking laws. New approaches to regulating DeFi are also being considered, with discussions ongoing about understanding and managing DeFi within existing regulatory frameworks.

To maintain solvency, the protocol takes over borrower accounts that violate collateral requirements. Underwater borrows are repaid using the protocol's reserves. However, if the protocol reserves fall below a governance-set threshold, searchers can extract value post-liquidation.

Borrowers must maintain over-collateralization at all times in Compound III. If they accrue excessive interest or their collateral's USD value decreases significantly, or their borrow increases too much, the account becomes liquidatable. Liquidators can extract value through arbitrage during this process.

When a liquidation occurs, the borrower's collateral is moved to the protocol balance sheet and reserves are reduced to cover the borrow. Arbitrage is possible only if the protocol's reserves have been depleted below the specified threshold due to absorption. Liquidators can buy discounted collateral, sell it at market price, and pocket the difference in a single EVM transaction.

Liquidations can occur on any blockchain where Compound III is deployed. The protocol is written in Solidity and can be deployed to any EVM chain with a price feed, sufficient liquidity, and on-chain governance. Running the liquidator example code for educational purposes requires cloning the Comet repository, installing dependencies, deploying the OnChainLiquidator contract, and running a script that monitors the blockchain for liquidation opportunities.

Liquidators play a crucial role in maintaining the health of the Compound protocol by incentivizing borrowers to keep their borrows solvent.

The text discusses the current state of the AAVE Direct Deposit DAI Module, highlighting its risks and potential consequences for MakerDAO. The volatile market environment has exposed AAVE as a high-risk platform due to its large exposure to stETH and cross-collateralization, which allows locked collateral to be taken out by other borrowers. Additionally, operating on multiple chains increases the risk of centralized bridge failure.

The current AAVE-DAI pool has sufficient reserves for MakerDAO to withdraw, but if DAI reserves become empty, they could be quickly snapped up by bots, potentially locking MakerDAO's liquidity for an extended period. This could cause issues with the surplus buffer, although it is a small percentage of total MakerDAO TVL (Total Value Locked).

The text suggests that the Stability Fee rate in Maker and AAVE are currently equal, so turning off the D3M (Direct Deposit Module) would not cause issues. However, this could lead to a decrease in DAI deposits via the AAVE D3M and a subsequent decrease in income for Maker.

The text concludes with a poll asking whether to temporarily set the AAVE D3M Debt Ceiling to 0 (Zero), with options being Yes, No, or Abstain.

The changes include allocating up to 8k Badger per week for testing new emissions programs or bribing, maintaining DIGG emissions at the same level as Q1 2022, and reducing Badger emissions in other areas.

   Author: Aki Balogh

   Overview: This proposal aims to incorporate the dlcBTC/WBTC pool gauge into the Gauge Controller on Ethereum's Arbitrum network. The proposal seeks to provide deep liquidity for both dlcBTC and WBTC, enhancing their usage within DeFi and supporting broader adoption of decentralized Bitcoin solutions in DeFi.

   Key Details:
   - dlcBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum, leveraging Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) for secure cross-chain transactions. It operates as an oracle-free system with minimal parameters and maintains a soft peg of 1 BTC = 1 dlcBTC.
   - WBTC is a tokenized version of Bitcoin on Ethereum, backed 1:1 by Bitcoin and managed by a consortium of custodians and merchants. It introduces counterparty risk as funds are held in centralized custody by BitGo.

   Rationale: Incentivizing the dlcBTC/WBTC pool will promote liquidity, improve trading experience, and foster a more robust DeFi ecosystem. DLC.Link has committed to co-incentivizing the pool.

   Governance: dlcBTC operates with minimal governance, utilizing a Chainlink proof of reserve feed for transparency and a custom oracle combining two NG pools. Audits have been conducted by Lightpaper & Audit Reports, MetaTrust, CoinFabrik, and others.

   Centralization Vectors: The dlcBTC protocol has no major centralization vectors as depositors' Bitcoin is secured in a Discreet Log Contract (DLC) and mint/burn signals are relayed through DLC.Link’s Attestor network.

   Market History: dlcBTC is supported by initial merchants, with additional merchants set to contribute significantly. It has passed the first of three proposals to list as collateral on Aave. Voting for its inclusion is currently live.",bullish,0.2546,2024-07-08 00:00:00+00:00,0.2972,0.2972,2024-07-08 00:00:00+00:00,0.1673212882953653,0.2756666666666666,0.0827441738675046,verySmall

The timeline for this process requires the Governance Facilitators to determine a limited process, trigger necessary votes and forum posts, and have a budget and Ecosystem Actors approved by August 1, 2023, with a deliverable due by September 1, 2023. The budget for Advisory Council projects is available per quarter, with all spending being limited to what is deemed necessary and likely to produce measurable value.

The primary issue pool supports new issues of tokenized securities, while the secondary issue pool supports trading of these securities. Both pools are integrated with traditional financial institutions such as investment banks, brokerages, and asset managers.

2. XS Finance is building out Time Weight Asset Market Manager (TWAMM) functionality for Balancer to execute large trades over a period of time, reducing slippage and gas cost. The first phase has been completed, and the team is currently working on their web app before final testing and deployment.

3. Several grants have successfully reached all their milestones this wave, including one awarded to Nethermind for developing and implementing Forta bots for security and real-time monitoring on Balancer smart contracts. These bots are deployed through the Forta app on Polygon and provide alerts directly to a dedicated Discord channel.

4. Another grant was awarded to Stefan (Delphereum) for adding full Balancer V2 support to Delpherium, a web3 implementation for the Delphi programming language. The Vault is almost entirely implemented, including batch swaps and events. A demo app has been developed and published.

5. mkflow, a long-time contributor to the Balancer DAO, continues to produce the Balancer Report weekly, providing an overview of the Balancer ecosystem each week. This grant has been successfully delivered with the publication of 5 newsletters.

   Summary: The proposal aims to establish a gauge for the pairing of inwBETH and wBETH on Ethereum, with inwBETH being a Restaked Token dedicated to wBETH obtained through InceptionLRT's restaking mechanism. InceptionLRT is an isolated Liquid Restaking protocol designed for Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), issuing Isolated Liquid Restaking Tokens (iLRTs) for each restaked LST. These iLRTs can be traded and used in DeFi protocols while maintaining segregation from the underlying LSTs. The goal is to increase liquidity of inwBETH, support its utility, and integrate it into various DeFi protocols.

The author argues that while protests can lead to important changes, they often fall short of achieving their long-term, fundamental goals due to a lack of self-organization and appropriate infrastructure.

The author proposes that the solution lies in harnessing the collective energy of protest movements and transforming them into self-organized forces capable of achieving desired outcomes. To do this, the author suggests focusing on developing the necessary infrastructure, concepts, and strategies to support these movements. The author also suggests that this effort should be undertaken on a global scale, as protests and issues related to change can be found everywhere.

The author acknowledges that they do not have all the answers and invites others to join in finding solutions. They propose taking practical steps towards achieving their vision and are ready to take action themselves.

Authors: Samyak Jain, Luis Schliesske
Status: Formal Submission
Proposed Date: 2021-1-4

Instadapp and Gelato have collaborated to integrate refinance automation into Instadapp's DeFi Smart Account (DSA), which are permissionless and non-custodial. This update allows users to set up refinance automation for ETH-A vaults in case of liquidation across Aave, ETH-B, or Compound. The process prioritizes refinancing as follows:

1. Aave (if no DAI liquidity)
2. ETH-B vault (if ceiling reached)
3. Compound

The automation works in two modes:
- Without oracle data: Users set a ratio for refinancing ETH-A vaults.
- With oracle data: Refinancing occurs only when the ETH-A vault is about to get liquidated.

The Maker Oracle feed is used to acquire and verify price data, ensuring secure automation for DSA users. The contract (ConditionMakerVaultUnsafe.sol) does not store or return the ETH/USD price; it processes the price in-memory and returns either ""OK"" or ""NOT OK"". If ""OK"", the Gelato bots automatically refinance the debt position.

The oracle data is permission-only to the contract, ensuring it meets whitelisting requirements. The involved contracts are Instadapp (samyak@instadapp.io) and Gelato (luis@gelato.digital). The contract to be whitelisted is ConditionMakerVaultUnsafe.sol – 0x3b50336E3E1E618FE74DF351966ebaD2B12cD24a.

Requirements include verified source code on etherscan, permission-based usage of oracle data to prevent parasitic behavior, and no storage of oracle data.

The Peg Keeper is designed to maintain the 1:1 peg between the USDC stablecoin and its corresponding crvUSD token by minting or burning crvUSD as needed. However, a concern is that if USDC depegs, excessive amounts of crvUSD may be minted, potentially leading to its devaluation.

The text highlights that the Peg Keeper's debt ceiling and aggregator mechanism are designed to prevent this issue. Simulations show that in 99% of cases, the Aggregator successfully blocks the USDC Peg Keeper from performing updates. The failure occurs only when there is more liquidity in the USDC Peg Keeper pool than all other Peg Keeper pools combined, which is an unlikely scenario due to a ""flight to safety"" from USDC to USDT during a depeg event.

The text suggests that diversifying the set of liquid Peg Keeper pools is crucial for risk management. This would help stabilize oracle prices in case of a stablecoin depeg and potentially require the creation of new TriCrypto-ng pools.

Future work includes extending the model to other key parameters, handling onboarding new markets, analyzing the effect of onboarding new stablecoins, expanding stress scenarios, improving model implementation, and applying the model to different market conditions and protocol parameters.

Over the past week, both protocols experienced significant liquidations due to a drop in BTC and ETH prices. The report focuses on the period from July 31, 2024, to August 6, 2024, analyzing affected vaults, collateral types, and financial implications.

The Maker Core system had 44 liquidations, with most occurring on August 5, resulting in $10.62M collateral auctioned and $9.4M debt repaid. The majority of the collateral was ETH and wstETH based. SparkLend experienced 203 liquidations, with $35.56M worth of collateral liquidated, primarily wstETH, WETH, and weETH.

In case of a further 20% price drop, Maker Core could see 66 vaults at risk, while SparkLend would have 128 wallets at risk. The report concludes that the crypto market's volatility underscores the need for sufficient collateral to protect against sudden price drops.

The argument for participation is based on market dynamics, widespread adoption of MEV extraction in PoW Ethereum, alignment with Ethereum Foundation and teams like Flashbots, and plans for Proposer Builder Separation.

The proposed approach for MEV extraction by Lido Node Operators (NOs) should be open, transparent, and democratic. The solution could involve using open-source infrastructure, outsourcing block building to public/open block builder markets, and adhering to an agreed-upon policy regarding MEV extraction and sharing of rewards with stakers.

The policy should be ratified by the Lido DAO prior to the Merge and include goals, scope, acceptable cases for NOs building blocks, the infrastructure that NOs can utilize, repercussions for non-adherence, and frequency of review. The identified infrastructure should be tested before use on Ethereum mainnet, and the policy should be periodically reviewed to assess its effectiveness and re-evaluate tools and infrastructure.

The deadlines for this process assume a potential Merge in late August.

   - Lowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero, which may curb borrowing by less sophisticated users but can be bypassed in V2's design.
   - Progressively increasing the reserve factors, which would lower the incentive for suppliers and suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.

To ensure fair representation, several stakeholder groups should be consulted: full-time contributors, leadership of core teams, DAO contributors, large token holders, and active Aragon stack users/builders.

The compensated teams' role is to structure a process for capturing various stakeholders' positions and crystallizing an initial consensus, not to determine the outcome collectively. The goal is to avoid bias and ensure inclusivity. It's crucial to design processes that do not favor those with more time or resources, as this can lead to echo chambers and decisions not reflecting the broader network.

4. The approach is compatible with future plans for Maker, such as The End Game Plan, as it draws from current conversations within Maker to improve the DAO.

5. To prevent Project-based allocations from becoming a race to the bottom, MKR holders will use various criteria beyond just price when evaluating projects. This model aims to give more experienced teams or those with a history of success in Maker a higher budget for execution.

1. **Security Considerations**: StakeWise relies on an Oracle network to accurately report daily staking rewards. Currently, there are 5 oracles live, and this number will increase to 10 over the coming months. The protocol is governed by the StakeWise DAO, with extra security features in place to prevent malicious transactions. There's no staking insurance currently, but it's being developed with a third-party provider.

2. **Staking Risks**: sETH2 holders are exposed to risks associated with staking, such as slashing events and downtime penalties. The StakeWise DAO vets prospective node operators, provides them with an institutional-grade deployment package, and has the ability to force exit validators from the network if necessary.

3. **Smart Contract Risks**: The protocol has undergone audits by 3 separate auditors and has no security concerns to date. A $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI is being added to further reduce risk for users.

4. **Price Oracles**: sETH2 currently relies on a UniSwap TWAP oracle, but will be upgrading to a Chainlink oracle over the coming months.

5. **Proposed Risk Parameters**: The proposed sETH2 risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH. The LTV and liquidation threshold are lower than ETH, accounting for the extra risks associated with liquidating sETH2 due to its high correlation and similar volatility profile with ETH.

6. **Interest Rate Model**: The interest rate model includes UOptimal at 50%, Base at 0%, Slope 1 at 8%, and Slope 2 at 200%.",bullish,81.9,2022-05-18 00:00:00+00:00,97.3,97.3,2022-05-18 00:00:00+00:00,0.1880341880341879,87.96666666666665,0.0740740740740738,verySmall

This proposal aims to combine their respective strengths, as Aragon focuses on smart contract infrastructure and PrimeDAO builds tools for DAO-to-DAO coordination. The proposed swap involves exchanging $50k in ANT (Aragon's token) for $50k in D2D (PrimeDAO's token). Both parties will benefit from product convergence, potential revenue sharing, and increased governance participation.

The proposal highlights the value of PrimeDAO's products: Prime Launch (a decentralized token launch platform), Prime Deals (for DAO2DAO interactions), and Prime Rating (a framework for quantifying web3 project quality). The teams will collaborate on a soft-integration, starting with a guide detailing the combined use of Aragon Client and Prime Launch.

The rationale behind this partnership is to leverage PrimeDAO's expertise in creating useful DAO tools and Aragon's reach for wider distribution. This collaboration will enable both projects to synchronize product evolution and coordinate better while decentralizing.

However, there are risks associated with the proposal, such as potential runway issues for PrimeDAO and technical compatibility concerns. The teams aim to mitigate these risks through monetization strategies and close collaboration.

The proposal is composed by team members from both Aragon and PrimeDAO. Key figures include Luuk Weber, a DAO strategist, and Alp Ergin, the Ops and Partnership Lead of PrimeDAO.

They argue that the current governance system, where 10% of the token supply is allocated to active voters, is a misallocation of capital as there are few active discussions happening on the platform.

The author proposes improvements in tokenomics, suggesting a more reasonable locking period for tokens and a system where rewards are proportional to the amount staked. They also suggest offering different liquidity provider (LP) options to allow investors to bet on the direction of the market while remaining invested.

Regarding index funds, the author believes that Balancer should prepare for the trillion-dollar derivatives market and focus more on creating multi-asset pools. They cite examples like Indexed.finance as a model for this approach.

The author also suggests that Balancer should expand into other areas such as oracles, non-fungible tokens (NFT), and AMM to capitalize on opportunities in these fields. However, they express concern about the current pool compositions on Polygon, suggesting that they are not well-suited for conservative investors or those looking to invest in long DeFi.

The proposal suggests adjusting the fee to reflect the current Prime Rate as published on August 10, 2022.

The argument for this change is that it would more accurately reflect the fees accruing in the 6S vault and update the fees charged at the trust level.

This deal aims to expand Maker's presence in real-world asset lending, potentially making it the decentralized lender of choice for community banks.

The process has been thorough, with multiple Maker core units working closely with HVB to analyze all aspects of the transaction, from legal to credit to engineering, and assessing associated risks. The deal structure adds a unique smart contract risk due to untested additions to the MIP21 suite of contracts, but the base MIP21 contract has been audited and tested extensively.

The transaction is seen as strategically beneficial for both parties, with HVB's reputation and Maker's performance throughout the process bolstering both on-chain and off-chain reputations.

The proposal aims to allow users to direct their staking rewards towards impact projects, while maintaining the existing staking structure for deposited stETH.

The project is planned to be compatible with both Lido's current and future validator models. Launchnodes intends to develop this feature as soon as possible after the Shanghai upgrade, focusing on Q1 2023. The development process will primarily rely on existing learning materials, documentation, and code.

Launchnodes is a company founded in April 2020 that supports individuals and organizations in running their own Proof of Stake blockchain nodes. They have been supporting Ethereum and over 15 other leading blockchains, and they pioneered Impact Staking in 2021.

The grant request totals $100,000, distributed as follows: 25% upon agreement, 50% upon completion of the scope of work, and 25% up to 30 days after completion. The project duration is estimated at 3 months, requiring a team of 2 Smart Contract Engineers, 1 Front End Engineer, 1 Back End Engineer, and 1 Test Engineer.

Access and ongoing support for the features outlined in the proposal are planned for at least 12 months after completion. The platform and Impact Staking as an initiative are expected to grow throughout 2023 and beyond, with potential community involvement through a dedicated DAO or similar structure.

   Category: AIP, Voting, Treasury

   Description: This proposal aims to reward a gas optimization contribution that has saved over 80 ETH (approximately 5.5% of the 3-year staking period) in gas fees and is expected to save a total of 1450ETH+ in the total 3-year staking period. The author, Codeislight, found gas optimization findings during the staking contract audit but were classified as out of scope by Immunefi. Due to time constraints, these optimizations were implemented by Horizen Labs. This proposal aligns with the DAO's guiding value ""Collective Responsibility.""

   Author: Codeislight, a smart contract developer and warden at Code4Arena who joined the web3 space in 2021 and has made open-source contributions to the ApeCoin staking contract.

   Motivation: To reward open source contribution that benefits the DAO community, attract and incentivize others to add value to ApeCoin, and highlight the importance of gas optimizations in smart contracts.

   Rationale: The gas optimization has already saved 80+ ETH in gas fees and is expected to save 1450+ ETH in the total staking period of 3 years.

   Specifications: Gas profiling was done using hardhat-gas-reporter and Hardhat unit testing setup, with Dune platform used to quantify the gas saved based on the percentages from the gas profiling table.

   Implementation Steps: If the proposal passes, 6000 APE$ can be rewarded to codeislight.eth.

   Description: A proposal is open to approve a deposit incentive of .0015 BADGER per CVX per vote for users who have already locked their CVX and are unable to deposit into the bveCVX vault. This incentive aims to encourage these users to delegate to or vote in line with Badger, with the goal of converting them into bveCRV depositors when their tokens unlock between December 24, 2021, and January 21, 2022. The incentive is designed to improve the Badger setts' yield and align delegators with vault depositors.

   Mechanism: Locked CVX holders who delegate to Badger or any pool that backs a Badger vault will accrue .0015 BADGER per CVX voted per vote. The BADGER will be distributed by March 1, 2021. The amount anyone can accrue per vote is capped by the amount they deposit in the vault.

   Implementation: Delegators and voters will continue to earn Badger bribes through votium and all other associated asset flows. The bveCVX vault will also receive an additional 10k cvxCRV a week as described in BIP 69. The accumulated BADGER will be shown in the UI for these users, and after the program ends, it will be distributed through the Badge Tree.

Date: 2024-01-09

Summary: This proposal aims to approve additional steps for the off-boarding of Aave v1, a deprecated protocol from January 2020. The current state of Aave v1 creates operational overhead and adds costs to the Aave DAO due to its monitoring and evaluation during development and security decisions.

To complete the off-boarding, the following steps are proposed:

1. Phase 1 - Update liquidation mechanism:
   - Disable aToken receipt for liquidations
   - Enable fixed liquidationBonus (e.g., 1%) for healthy positions
   - Allow liquidation of entire positions at once
   - Lower interest rates and remove flash loan fee

2. Phase 2 - Increase the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage based on market conditions
3. Phase 3 - Implement forced withdrawal mechanism allowing anyone to withdraw funds on behalf of Aave v1 liquidity providers

After completion, additional ad-hoc steps can be taken, such as a Rescue Mission for locked funds.

1809,1809,1809,2021-04-22 16:07:40.242000+00:00,makerdao," The Berlin hard fork is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) that aims to make transaction costs cheaper for certain operations. One potential use of this could be for incentive farming, where participants are rewarded for performing specific actions on the network. This method is noteworthy because it could potentially be more cost-effective than other methods.

The discussion of this possibility has been added to MIP45 (Maker Improvement Proposal 45), which deals with incentive mechanisms in the Maker protocol. However, incentive farming is a known risk in MIP45, and this method is no exception.

In addition to the Berlin hard fork, several other notes have been added to the Maker protocol:

1. Debt Queue Not Updated Automatically: There is no synchronization between the time it takes bad debt recorded from liquidations to ""mature"" into a form that is eligible for cancelation, and the collection of DAI from auctions. This is a known behavior of the system, and well-managed through appropriate tuning of risk parameters such as Vow.wait and those that control the duration of auctions.

2. Ethereum Is a Dark Forest: Transactions aiming to collect the kick or redo incentive can be front-run, potentially discouraging Keeper participation. It is also possible that certain calls to take may be front-runnable as well (especially if they rely entirely on DEXes or flash loans for liquidity).

3. Incentive Farming Might Be Possible Due to Misconfiguration: This note refers to QSP-2 and CS-Note-2, which discuss potential issues with incentive farming due to misconfigurations in the Maker protocol.

4. Initialization and Deployment Requires Extra Care: Non-trivial initialization and authorization procedures are necessary to integrate the new contracts into the system. Such actions are done in executive spells that undergo extremely thorough review and testing, but improvements are being made to this process.

5. Monotonicity of Price Functions: This note refers to discussions under QSP-6 (also equivalent to ToB-5).

6. No Stability Fee During Auctions: Since stability fees are not collected after a liquidation, it's theoretically possible for the proceeds of an auction to fail to offset the fees that would have been collected during the time the auction was running. However, this is mathematically impossible for practical values of fees (0 to 50%) and practical auction durations (a few hours to days).

7. Vat Debt Tracking Not Automatically Synchronized: Debt accounting in the Maker protocol is asynchronous, which allows for modularity and flexibility in the components of the system. While this can be challenging for newcomers to grasp, the benefits more than justify the design.

8. Gauntlet: This section discusses an audit performed by Gauntlet using economic simulation. The audit compared Liquidations 1.2 and 2.0, finding that Liquidations 2.0 outperforms Liquidations 1.2 in every unambiguous metric of throughput and collateralization risk. For the investigation of optimal parameter choices for 2.0, readers are referred to the report and a post on initial LINK-A parameters, which used the Gauntlet report to inform parameter choices alongside the Risk team’s complementary simulations and considerations.",bullish,4023.17,2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,4979.59,4979.59,2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,0.2377279607871405,4034.09,0.0027142775473072,verySmall

   Category: CORE - ECOSYSTEM FUND ALLOCATION

   Description: A proprietary AI-powered bot is proposed to enhance security in the BAYC Discord server. The bot detects abnormal behavior from mods/admins, such as excessive member banning or posting suspicious links, and ensures verification via a security NFT. It also protects against other bots being exploited and scam messages.

   Rationale: With the rise of NFT value, discord servers are becoming targets for scammers. Given BAYC's world-renowned status, it needs top-tier security. The proposed bot, developed by an experienced Discord security expert, will make the BAYC Discord the safest among NFT projects, driving value back to BAYC and Apecoin.

   Specifications: Custom bots with machine learning algorithms, Metamask, Wallet Connect integration, Alchemy API for verification, a dedicated security team, and proprietary machine learning algorithms tailored to prevent breaches.

   Implementation Steps: Optimize current discord security protocol, program and train the AI bot, train mods on its use, debugging and follow-up for one year.

   Timeline: 2 weeks for discord security optimization, 3-6 weeks for bot setup, mod training, and onboarding.

Author:
Date:  in YYYY-MM-DD format

Summary: Direct-to-AIP for Aave token [existing asset in Aave markets] or [asset that passed TEMP CHECK snapshot]

Motivation/Background: The intention to list the Aave token within the Aave ecosystem on Ethereum, taking advantage of its robust and diverse liquidity environment. This includes plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored for Aave, supporting staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave, and contemplating a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals.

Chains to be deployed/listed: The Aave token will be listed on the Ethereum blockchain. Listing parameters for the Aave token include its contract address, Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. These details are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.

(optional) Audits / Security Reviews: The Aave protocol has undergone thorough security audits and risk assessments by reputable providers. The assessment considered market risks such as volatility, liquidity, and other potential risks specific to the Aave token. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions were part of this analysis.

(optional) Useful Links: Previous governance votes about the Aave token and parameters can be found here: [Link 1], [Link 2]. These links provide context for the reasoning behind listing the Aave token on Ethereum and help users make informed decisions when voting.

Disclaimer: The author has no potential conflict of interests or relationship with the Aave protocol and did not receive compensation for publishing this proposal.

- If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
- If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.",bullish,84.49,2023-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,101.2,101.2,2023-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,0.1977748846017281,91.96999999999998,0.0885311871227363,verySmall

   Status: In Discussion and Editing
   Voting Period: 1-8 September via Aragon Voice
   Authors: @lee0007, @daniel-ospina

Proposal Summary:
The proposal aims to have the Main DAO approve funding to cover all outstanding commitments/debts from ESD (Ethereum Scalability Development) as per established agreements. The funding will be used for Sub DAO Member Payments (5400 ANT), EVM Crispr ($50001), Gravity DAO Conflict Mediation (4k), and other outstanding commitments between 1 August 2022 - 31 November 2022.

Rationale: The proposal seeks to verify the commitment to honor all approved funding for involved teams, ensuring adherence to the current Charter for approving and completing Main DAO payments.

Objectives & Deliverables: Main DAO funding for on-time and in-full payment of ESD commitments outstanding at 31 July 2022.

Strategic Alignment: The proposal aligns with the commitment to the growth of the Aragon Network, demonstrating a public commitment to honoring outstanding commitments via the governance process.

Limitations / Risks: Publicly denying funding to teams approved within the current governance process could undermine ecosystem trust.

Team Information: @daniel, @Fartunov Ivan, and @lee0007

Funding Request: 5400 ANT + ~54k USDC with final payments not exceeding S1 approved proposals.

1. Optimistic stETH Oracle: The system uses an optimistic stETH oracle for pricing, but close monitoring will be in place to prevent de-peg situations. In case of harmful de-peg situations, the market rate oracle can be switched as an emergency measure.

2. Rounding and Yield: Research was conducted to address a rounding issue related to Solidity fixed point precision. A minimum 1000 wei unit debt for a CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) was introduced, which represents 0.0000000000001% of a full Bitcoin. Additionally, there is a 1000 wei units minimum change of debt and collateral on user operations.

3. Redemption Debt Holding: The redemption fee scales based on the percentage of the system being redeemed in a given timespan. A TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) mechanic was added to prevent flashloan manipulation of the system debt. This uses the smaller of the TWAP value and spot value as the total debt for calculating the fee.

4. New Invariant suites & Automation: Additional test suites were added, including a Doomsday Tester and PriceFeed Tester. The protocol also leverages front-of-market property testing methodologies and fuzzing tools.

5. Native ETH Zaps: Users can now enter positions with native ETH, WETH, and wstETH, in addition to stETH. This feature is built using the Position Managers of eBTC and allows users to enter or increase collateral to positions, as well as exit or decrease collateral from positions.

6. Security Reviews: The protocol undergoes continuous security reviews at a PR and release level during development. In January, private security partners were worked with for further review. More information can be found in the interview series on Twitter.

7. What's next (a.k.a WHEN EBTC): Before eBTC is available for public use on ebtc.finance, an Immunefi bug bounty will be conducted in two stages: pre-launch and post-launch. The pre-launch bug bounty, which aims to be completed in late February, tests the final eBTC code deployed on mainnet but not yet officially live. After this, the protocol will be connected to the dapp and made publicly available.

Summary: A proposal is presented to add a gauge for the WNCG/WETH pool on Balancer's Ethereum mainnet. The proposal aims to attract more liquidity and deeper liquidity, benefiting both parties. Nine Chronicles, a decentralized free-to-play RPG based on Scandinavian mythology, is the protocol in question. It operates on a P2P network without central servers, with all game activities taking place on-chain. The in-game currency, Nine Chronicles Gold (NCG), can be bridged to Ethereum mainnet as its wrapped version, WNCG.

References:
- Website: https://nine-chronicles.com/
- Github Page: https://github.com/planetarium
- Discord: https://discord.com/invite/planetarium
- Twitter: https://twitter.com/NineChronicles

Motivation: The proposal aims to leverage Balancer's weighted pool for reduced impermanent loss and increased incentives for Nine Chronicles community members to deposit their tokens into the Balancer pool.

Specifications:
1. Governance: Currently managed by multisig, with open-source codes and discussions taking place in Discord.
2. Oracles: Not used as the game and bridge do not rely on external information.
3. Audits: Security audit reports available from Theori and Certik for the Ethereum bridge.
4. Centralization vectors: Governance systems are yet to be fully decentralized, with treasury functions managed by multisig and the bridge operated using an own Ethereum node along with Infura.
5. Market History: No DeFi protocol currently uses WNCG, making relevant events such as smart contract attacks or liquidations non-existent.

1. The Framework for SubDAO Transitory Collateral Asset Types and Centralized Transitory Collateral Asset Types is immediately nullified, and the Responsible Facilitator must remove it from 5.2.1.1 and 5.3.1.1.

2. SubDAO Transitory Collateral Asset Types are not subject to the requirements of Section 3.2. They can be specified by the Governance Poll initiated by the Responsible Facilitator, with GNO currently being the only listed asset type.

3. Centralized Transitory Collateral Asset Types are not subject to Benchmark Yield requirements but still need to meet the net surplus requirement. They can be specified in the soft element 5.3.1.1A, and WBTC is currently the only listed asset type.

4. Decentralized Collateral Direct Deposit Modules (DDM) must provide a yield at least equivalent to the Yield Collateral Benchmark Yield defined in MIP103 and earn the protocol a net surplus of at least 1 million Dai per year after maintenance, oracle, and other expenses.

5. Decentralized Collateral DDMs must provide the Maker Protocol a net surplus at least equivalent to the minimum requirement defined in Section 3.2.

6. SubDAO Decentralized Lending Modules can be subsidized with Decentralized Collateral DDMs, ensuring an active market exists. The subsidy rate is equivalent to the benchmark return of very low-risk collateral as defined in MIP103. This section applies to lending protocols under Maker Governance, regulated by the Ecosystem Scope, and being incubated for adoption by a future SubDAO as part of an Incubated Ecosystem Actor.

7. If the SubDAO Decentralized Lending Module supports WBTC as collateral, borrowers using WBTC must pay at least the full Yield Collateral Benchmark Yield, and Maker must be paid a yield equivalent to the Yield Collateral Benchmark Yield. WBTC borrows do not count towards the 200 million subsidy limit.

8. If the Decentralized Lending Module supports any centralized asset other than WBTC, it is not eligible for the SubDAO Decentralized Lending Module subsidy.

9. The Decentralized Fixed Rates Module must be developed and managed through this article, with further details defined in MIP113c2.6.1.2.1A and MIP104c4.

The text also acknowledges potential challenges for new contributors in understanding and handling L2 solutions, and plans to create a guide to help them.

Author: BGD Labs @bgdlabs

Date: 2024-01-09

Summary: Request for $86,500 in retroactive bug bounties from before the Aave-Immunefi official bug bounty program was established. The funds will be processed via an on-chain AIP. This proposal aims to address security reports submitted before the formal setup of the program and outside its scope.

The proposed rewards follow the evaluation metrics used in previous ad-hoc assessments, as it is deemed unfair to apply current Immunefi program rules retroactively. The details of some reports are not being disclosed due to potential dependencies and risks to non-Aave entities.

Three issues are addressed:
1. Inconsistent validation on Aave v2/v3 (Low severity, Certain likelihood, Proposed bounty: 10'000 USD)
2. Inconsistent Health Factor behavior in swap borrow rate mode (No impact, Certain likelihood, Proposed bounty: 5'000 USD)
3. Price manipulation of an asset listed on Aave v2 (Critical severity, Not likely likelihood, Proposed bounty: 65'000 USD + 6'500 USD as Immunefi fee)

1. Using the Token Bridge: This method involves a transaction cost of approximately 62 USD (60 USD for the Ethereum transaction and 2 USD for the bridge fee), plus additional costs for each transaction made with the converted tokens. If the user plans to make more than 4 transactions, it is more cost-effective to convert tokens to their r-equivalent, transact in RSK, and then turn them back to Ethereum.

2. Using Defiant integrated coin swap via Kripton Market: This method involves a service fee of approximately 10 USD for swapping DAI to rDAI and vice versa, plus the cost of sending the tokens. This option is more cost-effective from the 4th transaction onwards. Other advantages include no need to wait for 24 hours in each use of the bridge, no need to connect to two different networks, and using the wallet where the funds are stored.

Defiant also allows swapping among many pairs of tokens, not just DAI <> rDAI.

The proposal aims to secure a budget of $66,000 over four months for the Technical Support Guild, focusing on improving documentation, resolving tickets, and streamlining error reporting. The budget will be allocated as follows: $12,000 per month for guild member incentives using Disperse contracts and Coordinape circles, and $4,500 per month for bounties to encourage larger deliverables.

The Technical Support Guild's objectives in 2022 include improving documentation, resolving tickets efficiently, creating a platform for error reporting, decentralizing the guild, and identifying solutions that enhance its decentralization.

Key performance indicators include all tickets being resolved within an average of 1.67 replies per ticket, an average response time of less than 5 hours, and an average resolution time of less than 8 hours. The first month's report shows the guild has successfully taken over HelpScout ticket resolution, with a team of six onboarded members, eight more on the waiting list, and a focus on improving documentation and FAQ.

The distribution for the first month is proposed to be $5,625 among all guild members, with 80% decided by a Coordinape Circle of the guild members. The Technical Support Guild Steward will provide wallet addresses and weighted portions of the distribution to the Executive sub DAO by December 22, 2021, enabling each guild member to receive payment by December 28, 2021.

1. The Prime program has resulted in a weighted average supply and borrow increase of 210% and 419%, respectively, leading to an increased total supply position from $59,792,152 to $357,629,234 and borrow positions from $27,437,973 to $158,904,368.

2. To further incentivize user participation, 50 new Prime tokens will be released on a first-come, first-served basis for eligible users. This initiative aims to increase user engagement and market participation.

3. The current quarterly reward distribution is evaluated, with adjustments proposed for BTC, ETH, USDC, and USDT rewards. The total rewards in USD will be $900,000 according to the new proposal.

4. The proposed monthly reward distribution change aims to adjust rewards for eligible users based on the current total budget for Prime, estimated at $1,262,249. With the new Tokenomics V4, which increased the Prime allocation from 10% to 20%, the average protocol monthly reserves from January 2023 to June 2024 are $234,993.

  7. **Smart Contract Upgrade** (0.7 story points)

  8. **Total** (16.8 story points)

   **General Ecosystem Fit**
      - Swidge enables developers to use cross-chain liquidity in a safe and abstracted way, with the certainty that every piece of the system is decentralized.
      - The Swidge Protocol provides its Core Wrapper SDK (Swidge SDK) to protocols for B2B integrations, allowing them to interact with all aggregated protocols in a decentral manner as Swidge does not run any centralized backend.

   **Target Audience**
      - The Swidge Protocol is designed for dApp developers who want a simple way to integrate different liquidity protocols from various chains into their dApps.

   **Needs Met**
      - Swidge meets the needs of dApp developers by providing a straightforward method to interact with any protocol across multiple chains in an abstracted manner.

   **Similar Projects**
      - There are several projects aiming to solve interoperability of liquidity protocols across chains, but most rely on centralized logic or encode transactions for on-chain contracts, which can be a single point of failure in a decentralized financial infrastructure. Swidge addresses this issue by giving users ownership of the transaction encoding process and using Polywrap wrappers to hold the logic of the algorithm that checks possible paths and generates calldata required for contracts. This eliminates any centralized points of risk or exploitation.",bullish,0.2166,2023-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,0.2653,0.2653,2023-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,0.2248384118190212,0.2349333333333333,0.0846414281317328,verySmall

The author argues that stablecoins can serve as the cash equivalent in the crypto banking system, with fiat-backed stablecoins being on-demand liabilities backed by Treasury bills or bank deposits. However, the interest rate given to stablecoin holders will be limited by the t-bill rate.

To address the mismatch between long-term borrowers and short-term lenders, fractional-reserve banking can be introduced through cryptobanks. This allows a small amount of fiat-backed stablecoins to be expanded to a larger amount, providing more liquidity for economic activities.

The article emphasizes that crypto-banking is different from traditional banking, market-based banking, and shadow banking due to its focus on highly liquid assets as a defense against bank runs. The author concludes that while the crypto markets are still developing, we are close to having a robust Crypto Banking System with the integration of tools like Uniswap for lending, Aave as a money market, and cryptobanks like MakerDAO.

The current 10% liquidation incentive will be divided, with half going to liquidators (95% of the liquidated borrow amount) and the other half to Venus treasury (5%). A new Liquidator contract interface will be provided, replacing the old one after a 30-day grace period.

Liquidators will now call Liquidator.liquidateBorrow(...) instead of vToken.liquidateBorrow(...), and for BEP20 borrows, they'll need to approve tokens to the liquidator contract before calling liquidateBorrow. For BNB borrows, liquidators will send the corresponding repayAmount of BNB along with the liquidateBorrow transaction.

Indexers should listen to the new LiquidateBorrowedTokens event instead of the LiquidateBorrow event, as the previous one will still be emitted but with incomplete information. The upgrade will occur in two phases: first, deploying a fully functional version of the Liquidator contract on BSC mainnet; second, disabling the liquidateBorrow function of vBNB and vBep20 by adding a check that ensures msg.sender == comptroller.liquidatorContract().

The SM is a large risk mitigation pool designed to protect Aave users from potential deficits in an Aave Market. Extending coverage to other V2 markets would reduce risk for liquidity providers, potentially leading to market growth and increased equality among markets. The Safety Module protection will take into account the additional risks of these markets, such as chain failures (Polygon/Avax) and adherence to the DAO's stated risk parameters.

The Badger Treasury is facing a shortage of Stablecoins. To comply with the current policy of maintaining one year's worth of operating expenses in Stablecoins, the Treasury may need to either sell its bullish assets (BTC, ETH, BADGER) or borrow Stablecoins against these assets. Both options are undesirable due to potential losses from selling and high fees associated with borrowing.

To improve capital efficiency, a proposal has been made to reduce the Stablecoin holding requirement from one year to one quarter. This change aims to continue the Treasury's strategy of spending Stablecoins on development while preserving its core volatile crypto assets. Rebalancing could interfere with eBTC launch plans and limit the Treasury's growth potential.

Implementation would require maintaining a minimum of three months' worth of operating expenses at all times, with an additional one month buffer each time replenishment occurs to avoid frequent transactions.

The foundation appoints and removes Guardians through the Aragon Shield Multisig, which also sets the parameters of the Guardian DAO.

Guardians have permissions to pause or veto Aragon DAO proposals based on pre-defined criteria. There are two types of Guardians: Tech Guardians and Legal Guardians, each with specific roles.

Tech Guardians review Ethereum proposals for potential malicious activity, ensure the proposal's description matches its transaction output, and veto any proposal without a sufficient description.

Legal Guardians oversee proposals submitted to the Aragon DAO, vetoing any that finance illegal activities, involve sanctioned individuals or entities, or could result in the ANT token being classified as securities or the Aragon DAO engaging in regulated activities under Swiss financial market laws. They also ensure financial proposals have filled out the Financial Compliance Form.

Voting in the Aragon DAO involves a delay period and a voting period. During the delay period, locked ANT cannot be slashed; it is simply locked and returned when the period expires. Anyone with wANT or delegated by another Ethereum address with wANT can vote during the 7-day voting period. wANT holders can override their delegate's vote at any time during the voting period.

A snapshot is taken at the beginning of the vote period, capturing the voting power of ANT Holders and Delegates. Votes are binary (Yes/No). A vote passes when the minimum participation and level of support in the parameters are met after the 7-day voting period.

Author: @DigiFT
Date: 2023.10.20

Summary: This proposal suggests that Aave invest a portion of its treasury's stablecoin holdings in low-risk RWAs, specifically U.S. Treasury bills, through DigiFT. The investment aims to diversify the portfolio and mitigate risk from high-volatile crypto assets. Investing via DigiFT, a compliant DEX, offers T+3 settlement, liquidity due to the liquid T-bill secondary market, and daily proof of reserve.

DigiFT's U.S. Treasury Token (DUST token) is a fully regulatory-compliant U.S. T-bill token, backed by single US T-notes with different maturities. The Aave community can choose specific T-bills or a basket of T-bills with different maturity. Investors can redeem during the remaining tenure of the T-bills or hold to maturity.

Benefits of considering DUST include liquidity, simple structure, regulatory compliance, and daily proof of reserve. DigiFT also offers other fixed-income products like high-quality bank bonds.

The proposal suggests a comfortable amount of 3M USDC for investment in DUST. The team is open to discussions and a community call to discuss this proposal and related topics like using RWA as collateral for the stable coin, GHO.

   Overview: Proposal for an oracle to provide the GNO/USD price during collateral onboarding process in GNO. The oracle utilizes a mix of USDT, ETH, and direct-to-USD pairings to minimize quote manipulation due to low volume of the token.

   Data Model: Binance for GNO/USDT, Balancer, Kraken, Uniswap V3 for GNO/WETH, GNO/XBT, GNO/ETH respectively. ETH/USD and USDT/USD data models are also included for price reference.

   Oracle Supporting Data Model(s): ETH/USD (canonical) and USDT/USD.

   Oracle Address: Medianizer and Oracle Security Module addresses yet to be determined.

   Supported Tools: Setzer, Omnia, Gofer for GNO/USD, and their respective Goerli counterparts TBD.

   Rationale: Due to the low volume of GNO, the data model leans towards Automated Market Makers (AMMs) as price manipulation on them is quickly arbitraged by MEV bots and generally costs more transaction-wise than centralized exchanges. However, this makes the token problematic from an Oracle risk perspective, and it's recommended to take a subset of available price sources based on highest 24h volume, level of trust, and on-chain preference to reduce the risk of price manipulation while increasing the risk of source failure.",bullish,673.0,2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00,900.0,900.0,2022-11-10 00:00:00+00:00,0.337295690936107,778.6666666666666,0.1570084200099058,small

Assuming full usage of supply caps and current liquidation factors, the total borrowing power would be approximately $11.9M. With a 60% borrow usage, the borrowing volume would be around $7.1M, leading to a supply volume of $13.9M.

With these assumptions and the present Interest Rate curve, the Supply APR is 2.25%, Borrow APR is 3.65%, Supply Distribution APR is 5.42%, and Borrow Distribution APR is 3.65%. This results in Net APRs of 7.67% for supply and 1.24% for borrow.

   Summary: The proposal aims to renew the Orbit program for recognized delegates, compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement for gas costs associated with their governance activities. This compensation is intended to support delegates' focus on Aave and their continued contribution to our governance.

   Key Points:

   - The proposal extends Orbit for a new quarter, taking into account the transition to Governance V3 and its gasless voting feature via Gelato integration.
   - While general gas rebate programs may be discontinued, targeted gas rebates will be maintained for proposal creation and payload deployment activities.
   - Eligible platforms include EzR3al, Stable Labs, Saucy Block, and Areta.
   - The period covered is from Block 19162697 (5th Feb 2024) to Block 19860031 (May 13th 2024).
   - ACI and TokenLogic will receive 2.74 ETH and 0.641 ETH respectively for their governance-related activities.
   - The budget is 60000 GHO and 3.381 ETH.
   - Community feedback is sought, followed by a potential move to the ARFC snapshot stage and AIP stage if consensus is achieved.

Summary: The proposal aims to whitelist the Manifold Finance pool (50% FOLD / 50% WETH) on Balancer.fi. This pool has generated significant volume incentives and bribes, making it crucial for Manifold's growth at this stage.

Protocol Description: Manifold Finance provides access to high-value transaction pools through their infrastructure, SecureRPC, which aggregates multiple endpoints and maintains direct access to various mining pools/validator nodes.

Motivation: With current onchain liquidity at 300k and past volume incentives exceeding 4m$, deepening liquidity is key for Manifold.

Specifications:
- Governance: Utilizes an elected dictator system, with FOLD tokens delegating protocol control to one address (the dictator). Accounts can elect a new supreme dictator by removing their support and reallocating it towards a new address.
- Oracles: Not Applicable.
- Audits: Conducted and security issues handled through GitHub and Defi Threat Matrix.
- Centralization vectors: Utilizes Permissive Action List for partner integrations, with potential risks from GitHub deletion, Google Services, centralized Discourse forum, and certain account addresses holding large amounts of FOLD tokens.
- Market History: The pool has been active for 14 days, generating over 225k volume since inception, approximately 84k$ BPT with a current APR of 256% & fees of 1200$ in the past 24h.
- Value: While the majority of LP are on Sushiswap, this pool offers higher rewards and potential bribes, making it an attractive option.",bullish,6.33,2022-08-12 00:00:00+00:00,12.35,12.35,2022-08-12 00:00:00+00:00,0.9510268562401264,6.886666666666667,0.0879410215903106,high

   Description: The initial version of Pando, a distributed remote protocol for git based on IPFS, Ethereum, and AragonOS, is being revived to make it production-ready. Pando allows communities and decentralized organizations to own their code and repositories in a decentralized manner.

   Vision: The long-term goal is for projects to host their repositories through Pando, with updates requiring community approval via voting. This aligns with Aragon's vision of being fully owned by the community. Multiple Aragon contributors have endorsed Pando.

   Duration and Milestones: The project will not have an end; even if work stops, the code will be maintained by the community. Key milestones include refactoring the code to work with current AragonOS (Aragon Connect in particular) by October 2020, making it as easy to create a Pando organization as a Dandelion one through Aragon (testnet) by January 2020, and launching on Mainnet by March 2020.

The proposal outlines the migration of the current Compound governance forum from Discourse to Commonwealth, offering a unified platform for forum discussions, snapshot votes, and on-chain governance.

Commonwealth is a decentralized tool consolidating various community tools into one place, providing a fully crypto-native forum and voting interfaces. It has been adopted by over 900 DAOs, including dYdX, Stargate Token, Osmosis, Element Finance, Axie Infinity, and Redacted Cartel. The transition process involves importing the Compound Discourse Forum to Commonwealth, integrating governance contracts, and enabling users to access their communities via a single interface.

Key benefits of using Commonwealth include improved access to information, voter education, increased participation, prevention of spam and social engineering attacks, high-touch customer service, and the ability to create separate subDAOs for complex organizational structures. The platform is also planning upcoming initiatives such as notifications, moderation functionality, an API, app store, and more.

For users, migrating to Commonwealth is simple: link a wallet via Metamask or Wallet Connect, join the Compound Commonwealth forum, link the same email used for Discourse, and begin discussions.

However, this move has led to less liquidity and eventual fizzling out of DeFi projects on PCS, negatively impacting both PCS and DeFi. The issue lies in the lack of education about earning from pools without Cake rewards, and deincentivizing established PCS ecosystem projects is not a solution. To maintain current CAKE emissions while encouraging more liquidity and pools, it's proposed to create a new farming token designed for future growth. Key features include:
1. Minimum CAKE holdings required
2. Supporting 10X liquidity growth with competitive rewards
3. Higher APR in all pools, including long-term ones

The project involves the CEL Token, a yield-generation platform token used on the Celsius Network, a leading retail lending provider. The CEL Token is utilized within the MakerDAO ecosystem as a collateral asset with both earning and borrowing capabilities.

The Celsius Network aims to return up to 80% of its revenue back to users in the form of crypto rewards. With over 500K registered users and $17B in community assets, there is a growing demand for CEL Token deployment and acquisition. The CEL Token would complement MakerDAO's platform, allowing both parties to establish a symbiotic relationship, promoting growth, security, and longevity.

Celsius has launched an initiative towards financial transparency and auditability by third parties, aiming for over 90% of its transactions to settle on an open distributed ledger. This initiative provides clarity regarding the platform's financial position and ownership concentration.

CEL Tokens provide holders with utilities over the Celsius platform, including preferential rates for services based on loyalty tiers determined by the ratio of CEL Tokens to other coins held in their accounts. The Celsius Network Ltd is the issuer of the CEL token and resides in the UK. Exchange for the asset occurs on platforms like Uniswap, Liquid, FTX, OKEx, Bitfinex, Bittrex, and directly with Celsius (OTC).

Possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type include Chainlink's CEL/ETH Price Feed. The project can be audited through resources like Chainalysis, which confirmed an audit of $3.31B in assets.

1. A new Safe with an OptimisticGovernor module will be created, and ownership will be transferred to a Uniswap designated multi-sig for safekeeping. The multi-sig will receive $50,000 worth of ETH from the Uniswap Treasury, which will only be used for reimbursing delegates.

2. Gas rebate transactions will be proposed quarterly by the UMA bot (or anyone else) to the optimistic oracle contract. Proposers must post a bond of 2 WETH for a 1-day challenge period.

3. Oracle participants review the proposed transactions using the public script, and if not disputed, gas rebate transactions can be executed via UMA Bot (or anyone else) who covers the gas costs. If disputed, the proposal is escalated to UMA's DVM for dispute resolution between the proposer and disputer.

4. The Uniswap DAO will top up the Safe balance as needed. UMA will develop a gas rebate script and a dune table for easy verification of gas rebate transactions.

5. Anyone can initiate a dispute by navigating to https://oracle.uma.xyz/ and finding the Uniswap gas rebate proposal. UMA token holders vote to resolve disputes, with the correct party rewarded from the opposing party’s bond.

6. A quarterly report will be provided on the Uniswap forum for transparency regarding the amount of funds disbursed, the number of eligible addresses, etc.

7. The OptimisticGovernor contract has been audited by Open Zeppelin and has over $1B of TVS through UMA’s OO. The module will only be connected to the newly made gas rebate Safe.

8. The proposed optimistic workflow is better suited for ongoing gas rebates than the current Uniswap governance process, as it allows for ongoing rebates without a governance vote each time, verifies transaction data more effectively, and can go from proposal to execution in 24 hours compared to the typical 23 days for a governance proposal under the current process.
