3,9,9,9,2023-03-16 21:12:48+00:00,synapse,"Summary
We propose that Synapse should look to augment the current nUSD & nETH liquidity pools by using actively managed concentrated liquidity pools. To do so, the Synapse DAO should engage with liquidity partners who will provide locked, fixed term liquidity in pools that LPs are incentivized to actively rebalance when needed. We propose Nima Capital to be the first liquidity partner, providing $40m of actively managed stablecoin liquidity for a 12-month term.


Proposal
One month ago, Googly made a proposal highlighting the current inefficiencies of Synapse’s emissions and liquidity: https://forum.synapseprotocol.com/d/242-recalibrating-syn-emissions

SYN emissions currently inflate the circulating supply at 5.7%, or $12mm at the current price, per annum. Those emissions are directed towards nUSD pools, collectively home to ~$55m in TVL. While the distribution of emissions per pool is meant to direct liquidity towards pools with the highest utilization (and away from those with the lowest utilization), in practice, this has not materialized. Why? Markets are inefficient.

How can we fix this? We think the root of utilization disparity lies not with an inefficient distribution of incentives, but rather, with the lack of active, quantitatively driven liquidity rebalancing. 

Under the current stableswap AMM implementation, ~95% of the total liquidity is typically unutilized due to the nature of the AMM curve. 
 
 
 
 
![Picture1.png](ipfs://bafkreifsrpedrb5hxogvyuxwncrl7eddw5tjwgdeksnhpqxc2cfbbev4ta)
    
    
    
This means that the majority of SYN incentives are wasted as liquidity is only drawn upon in tail scenarios. By building actively managed concentrated liquidity, a-la-RFQ, we believe we can increase liquidity efficiency by 20-50x compared to current utilization & spreads. However, this requires controlled liquidity & active management, and, as a result, is not feasible under the current passive third-party liquidity provision model.

Therefore, our proposal is as follows:
1.	Nima Capital provides $40mm of twelve-month locked stablecoin liquidity. 
a.	This TVL will be programmatically rebalanced as required to tighten quotes on the most utilized pools. 
i.	We believe $40mm of actively managed stablecoin liquidity can be 20-50x more efficient than today’s $55mm in passive stablecoin liquidity.

2.	Nima Capital receives a SYN grant from the DAO via the Foundation of the currently planned stablecoin emissions and 33% of bridge & swap fees for the duration of the term, aligning a long-term capital partner with the DAO. 
a.	Note, this replaces SYN emissions and does not add to them. 
b.	We believe programmatic rebalancing will create a long-term structural advantage for Synapse DAO, resulting in increasing efficiency of liquidity, tightening quotes for users & reducing SYN inflation.

3.	Work alongside protocol contributors to build a new liquidity model which increases quote efficiency by an est. 20-50x. 


In summary, in return for Nima’s provision of locked TVL, we believe we can:
1.	Maintain the annual SYN inflation rate.
2.	Increase liquidity efficiencies through programmatic rebalancing & new liquidity models. 
3.	Tighten quotes on Synapse’s most utilized pools. 
4.	Remove the risk of liquidity reversions as a result of broader market conditions.

In a Snapshot in late march, the Synapse DAO voted to advance the protocol’s liquidity model by working with Nima Capital, an experienced crypto market maker, to be the first liquidity partner to participate in actively managed concentrated liquidity pools. Over the past few months, the firm has successfully reduced quotes on many crucial stableswap bridge routes [[Tweet]](https://twitter.com/SynapseProtocol/status/1651314704671703041). 

By active liquidity providers quoting tight prices, the DAO no longer needs to incentivize passive liquidity pools and can create a long term sustainable model for the protocol.  

Nearly two months after evaluating the success of the manual management, a more formalized path to turning off emissions on stableswap pools has been proposed. 

In the short term, Synapse should reduce all stableswap emissions by 50%, reduce Metis and Fantom emissions to zero , and decrease emissions on high volume pools proportionately less (Arbitrum/BNB Chain).

*The Metis Foundation has agreed to incentivize the Metis Pools with $15k worth of METIS for three months. *


**Proposed Changes:**

Arbitrum : 19958 -> 19958 
Avalnache : 20160 -> 4000
BNB Chain: 17338 -> 12000
Canto: 7999 -> 5000
Fantom: 15120 -> 0 
Metis: 11340 -> 0
Optimism: 7056 -> 7056
Polygon: 15120 -> 7560 

Current Weekly Total: 114,141 SYN
**Proposed Weekly Total: 55,574 SYN**


**Final thoughts:**

Given the clear benefits to reducing SYN emissions, this is the first step to pursuing a more capital efficient protocol. Following this there should be 
 - Better infrastructure for active liquidity providers to automate concentrated liquidity 
- Ensuing proposals that further reduce emissions

9,23,23,23,2024-01-08 16:56:18+00:00,synapse,"Background:
In July of 2023, the Synapse DAO voted to remove emissions on the Metis stableswap and ETH pool as part of a larger initiative to reduce SYN emissions. This proposal decreased SYN emissions from 11,340 SYN/month to 0. Simultaneously, the Metis Foundation agreed to incentivize the Metis Pools with $15k worth of METIS for three months.

Performance:
In the last six months, ~$19m has been bridged to Metis, generating around ~$15k worth of fees. The swap pools have done ~$38m over the same time period and $3.5k worth of fees. In the last month, a drastic increase of activity in the Metis ecosystem drove $14k in fees (500% increase).

Synapse is currently the largest bridge into the Metis ecosystem, and the Metis foundation is looking to create a lasting relationship with the protocol.

Proposal:
The Metis Foundation willing to commit to providing $7k/$10k worth of emissions on a monthly basis for the next 6 months. The Synapse DAO will spend $10k worth of SYN on Metis pools per month, with 70% of that subsidized by Metis.

In the last month, fees on Metis have been 14k, due to deep liquidity and support from the Metis foundation (who incentivized the pools for 6 months throughout 2023)

Objectives:
As part of this program, Metis is looking for low slippage on specific size swaps, and the ability to scale with increasing inflow to the chain from other L2s specifically. More reporting on these items will strengthen the relationship between the two protocols and can help the Synapse DAO to grow synergetically.

Synopsis:

In 2022, the Sushi community mandated that the DAO pursue a legal entity structure to protect business liability. In April of last year, Tangle, a community member, presented the initial governance discussion proposing hiring the law firm Fenwick & West LLP to provide the legal guidance and services to purpose-build the appropriate entity. Throughout the process, it became evident that the model should expand and employ additional steps outside their proposed model. Suggested to the team was further legal advice to help shape the process further with Gresham International. Gresham is a leading international law firm with offices in the UK and UAE. They’ve worked with leading centralized exchange operators and DeFi projects. Gresham advised expanding the entity scope to help establish a more global presence for Sushi, which provides optionality for future business initiatives unavailable in the Fenwick model. Working closely with Gresham, we propose a new model subsidized from the remainder of the budgetary allocation for Fenwick’s work. The result will increase its liability protections for the DAO and contributors.

Current proposals in the community with block reward decrease of 90-98% strongly damages APY for LP. As a result, a significant part of liquidity providers most likely will leave and with lower liquidity, we can't compete with other AMMs. 

Lowering inflation too early may lead to hazardous consequences for the ecosystem. Other proposals create imbalances between the interests of different groups of users of sushiswap and serve mostly whales with opportunistic aims. 

Three different groups of people use Sushiswap. Farmers, who provide liquidity. Holders of $SUSHI, who provide price and economics of $SUSHI. Casual traders, who seek high liquidity and pay fees. Without any of them, the ecosystem will die. Our proposal is intended to satisfy every party.

We propose to decrease block reward more slowly, however, to have less inflation on a distance:

The first month: 150 $SUSHI per block and $10mln buyback from funds received from @chefnomi to cover ""additional"" inflation.
The second month: 100 $SUSHI  per block and $4mln buyback.
For the next ten month: 80  $SUSHI per block.
Finally: 50  $SUSHI  per block for a second year.

With this plan, we will have much less inflation after one year as with 100 $SUSHI per block, and drop will be less damaging and slower. The buyback will compensate for inflation influence on price.

DoG Protocol’s application scored pretty well across most of the criteria. They’re offering unique infrastructure that can be easily leveraged by other game developers on Arbitrum specifically targeted towards increasing game usage and user retention. Their product is highly composable and their distribution mechanism is simple and clear.

Equiliria’s application scored well across most criteria. Their application had a thorough execution plan with sufficient justification for milestones, goals, KPIs, and the calculation of their requested grant size.
Furthermore, their execution strategy should lead to a significant amount of stickiness and long-term benefits post-incentive period. The protocol’s design will inherently make Arbitrum more competitive due to higher socialized yields. Lastly, there has been proven demand for the product and the grant will help scale it further.

Overall, Lido presented a really thorough and great proposal. They provided a very detailed execution plan, grant justification, quantifiable milestones that are easily trackable. Co-contribution of incentives also helps ensure liquidity stickiness in addition to the further integrations of wstETH across Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem. Creating deep LST liquidity will considerably strengthen Arbitrum’s competitive position.

*GMX Feedback)*
The proposal from Lido DAO's Liquidity Observation Labs (LOL) demonstrates a clear and comprehensive strategy to drive the adoption and usage of wstETH on Arbitrum. Their past success in growing wstETH on other Layer-2 networks, combined with a detailed plan for incentivization, integration, and measurement of success, instill confidence in their ability to achieve their objectives. The team's experience in managing previous grants and their focus on long-term sustainability and growth are evident. With a well-thought-out execution plan, including incentivizing liquidity pools, governance token pairs, and leveraged staking protocols, this proposal seems poised to significantly increase wstETH activity on Arbitrum, contributing to the broader expansion of the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem. We really like their strategy of matching the grant incentives post the LTIPP grants are over to maintain the liquidity on the protocol. Additionally, Lido is one of the most influential applications in the DeFi ecosystem. Their Wrapped Staked ETH (wstETH) has received traction on the platform without incentives. wstETH with enough liquidity could be a foundational staked asset on the chain, the additional liquidity allowing more projects to integrate the token and give users less reason to return back to the mainnet for wstETH buying/bridging. The LOL is also willing to match the grant request, further making this a good return on investment for the DAO. The KPIs and Milestones look fine to me. Overall, this proposal shows promise and deserves support.

Yield Yak’s application scored well across a lot of criteria. They had clear milestones, KPIs, goals, and objectives, and based their ARB distribution according to key milestones which is great. Their incentive mechanism is very basic and more could of been done there to incentivise stickiness. Their project is very composable and they have decent integrations thus far.
They sufficiently justified their requested grant size, however, we would’ve like to see more thought behind trying to migrate their Avalanche users to Arbitrum by using ARB incentives. Lastly, we are slightly concerned about product demand on Arbitrum given their age.

[https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tradao-ltipp-application-final/21884](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tradao-ltipp-application-final/21884)

## Request: 100,000 $ARB (Reduced from 190,000 $ARB)

### Feedback Summary:

The council feedback could be summarized as:

1. Wintermute: Criticized the large grant request, unverifiable metrics, and lack of anti-sybil measures

2. GMX: Lack of product-market fit and transaction numbers. Found the grant request to be inefficient and the incentive strategies unproven.

3. GFX: Highlighted concerns about the large grant size and the challenge in verifying Tradao's metrics. Recommended revising the application with enhanced sybil protection measures and to consider feedback from multiple reviewers for a future submission.

### Key Metric Update

As Tradao's permissionless copy trading function launched in early March before the LTIPP application program deadline, the metric of copy trading cannot fully reflect our product-market fit. Here is some update about our metric.

* Traded: 828
* Address: 66

New

* Trading volume: 70,540,917(Copy Trading) + 11,053,160(Direct Referral)

2. https://www.gmxreferrals.com/arbitrum (Search Code: Tradaox)

### Key Adjustment

In response to feedback from the Council and recent dencun upgrade, we propose resubmitting the application with a reduced grant amount by removing the rebates of GMX's excution fee, eliminating trading competition and wallet generation incentive.

Setting the new grant request at 100K ARB, we will implement the following incentive scheme:

* Increase the total transacted volume via Tradao
  * Currently at $1.63M daily volume
  * Targeting ~$3M daily volume
* Incentivize fee rebate → less cost to trade → more trades → more volume and likely users
* As Tradao is totally free to every user, we don’t charge any cost from users. This means all the costs are the gas fee and the fee charged by GMX. We will rebate 80% of open fees back to users. To achieve this, at a target of $3M daily volume and 100 daily transactions, across 12 weeks, it would require:
  * USD equivalent = ($3M * 0.06% * 80%) * 365 * 12/52 = $121.29K
  * ARB amount = $121.29K / $1.2 = 100K ARB at $1.2

## Expected milestones

Initial unlock 33% of ARB

Milestone 1: 84m Trading Volume (66% of ARB unlocked & 33% of ARB distributed)

dappOS presented a concise application, but they scored decently across most sections in the rubric. Their product has also seen past success with incentives through GMX’s grant program. While their milestone section and KPIs could’ve been more detailed, we feel that their distribution mechanism and the novelty of their product are strong enough reasons to support this application.

dappOS’s application was good and scored well across various criteria. They seem to have a pretty large user base (hard to verify such data) that is active across multiple chains and protocols, therefore, acting as a nice funnel to the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Their goals, KPIs, and milestones are all clear in their purpose and their justification of grant size is sufficient and reasonable given their goals and level of activity.
Our main concerns are that they are already receiving funding from STIP via GMX’s grant program which could be seen as double dipping and it makes it hard to fully understand how organic the current metrics are.
Furthermore, their incentive mechanism does not provide any new data and mimics what has previously been done for GMX.

Improving oracle diversity on a chain increases the resilience of the ecosystem, not only because protocols have more choices of oracle provider, but also because protocols can use combinations of oracle providers for different risk profiles, asset types, and as failsafes in the event of a primary oracle failure. 
This grant plan’s main weakness is the large spend. The cost per additional oracle is considerably higher than other oracle provider grant applications. Pyth, however, has a demonstrated ability to gain adoption on Arbitrum, and also provide more exotic or esoteric oracle feeds by virtue of the sheer number of feeds. On balance, the benefits of having a competitive oracle ecosystem on Arbitrum and Pyth’s track record with working within the ecosystem outweighs the scoring penalties from the large size of the request.

Compound’s application was strong across most criteria. They presented a strong understanding of their overall vision, goals, and benefits that this will bring to Arbitrum. While we would’ve liked to see more assets listed before incentives start, there is already a solid amount of demand for the protocol on Arbitrum. We think Compound’s integration with CEX’s, existing Whale userbase on Mainnet, and overall TVL is an important value proposition for the Arbitrum community.

A decent application that score below average due to its current usage metrics and deployment date on Arbitrum (We’ve noticed that the rubric does seem to bias a bit too heavy towards established projects, and this is in our opinion an application that reflects a good idea that scored low). Given its a peer to peer lending protocol we thought their might be some sybil concerns where individuals could just net the ARB yield, but given the over-collateralization requirements feel that this is mitigated. Otherwise, we felt this was really well presented grant request and we really liked that they divided the ARB based on milestone metrics. We will be supporting this application as fixed rates and peer to peer lending is an area Arbitrum could compete better on.

Lumin’s application was solid despite the low overall score. They did well in calculating and justifying their grant request and provided clear objectives, KPIs, and milestones. We liked that they split their grant request into two stages, requiring their protocol to hit certain milestones before having their second tranche of ARB unlocked. Their protocol also offers some unique product offerings and is pretty composable.
However, they did score poorly due to their lack of product usage and age of deployment on Arbitrum. As a result, this pulled down the expected benefit from their requested grant size.

Hop’s application was great and scored well across a range of criteria. They have an excellent reputation and strong usage statistics.
They provided clear milestones, KPIs, and goals, and provided sufficient justification for their grant size.
Our main concern is with the overall distribution mechanism and cost to the DAO. We would’ve liked to see a justification of TVL target based on user cohort trade size which would inform how much TVL is required to reduce slippage and attract larger bridging volume. Or even begin bootstrapping in-demand assets to Arbitrum.
Furthermore, we don’t think spending money on bridge rebates is the best use of DAO funds as it doesn’t actively target increasing user base and activity but mostly reduces the burden for users who were already looking to bridge.
Unfortunately, due to the reasons above we will not be supporting this application.

The primary weakness of this grant plan is the sheer size. Given clear execution plan, walking through how the applicant arrived at the requested amount, and milestones, the application overcomes the penalty for the large request. We recommend approving this grant.

We are generally supportive of approving Hop’s grant. Hop Protocol is a substantial player in the bridge sector and has huge potential to help Arbitrum grow generally. Bridges are also sites of high crosschain traffic, so this provides an opportunity to put Artbiutrm in front of new users. The detailed breakdown of how the grant will be utilized, including specific percentages allocated to different aspects such as liquidity mining incentives, gas fee subsidies, and bonder fee subsidies, demonstrates a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The plan to incentivize user ""stickiness"" by subsidizing onboarding fees while ensuring a stake in the network through ARB token rebates is particularly innovative and likely to achieve long-term engagement. They, are also open to match the grants funds with the HOP protocol DAO treasury funds which is a good sign.

We thought this was a very interesting grant. It offers a fun incentive mechanism with the prize box. Unfortunately, in a (correct) attempt to mitigate sybil farming of that prize box, it would be restricted to existing accounts. That dramatically narrows the focus of the grant, since it’s no longer able to use its most interesting mechanism to acquire new users for Arbitrum, and instead must make it up with increasing the amount of activity of existing users. In the end, the score was not high enough to recommend approval, but we strongly encourage the applicant to reapply to future grants cycles, particularly if they can find a way to retain sybil resilience and also target new users.

Bebop presented a very thorough well written application. They scored well across most of the rubric; however, their milestone section could’ve been improved greatly to include trackability and focus on increasing activity. Due to the nature of the execution strategy, pairing usage incentives with increased solvers for best execution, as well as their strong justification, fair grant ask, and current traction we will be supporting application. 

*GMX Feedback*
Bebop, a DEX aggregator, has a considerable user base on various Layer 2 solutions, positioning them well to attract users from other L2 platforms to Arbitrum with the proposed incentives. Their unique incentive mechanisms, including gasless transactions and mystery box campaigns, add an unique aspect to their proposal. Moreover, Bebop offers easy integration for other projects through their APIs, enhancing composability within the ecosystem. The introduction of their aggregation system, JAM, aims to optimize trades for users, further contributing to their appeal. While the grant size is deemed somewhat high, there's confidence in Bebop's ability to deepen their presence within the Arbitrum ecosystem using the 400k incentives. Although it would have been preferable for them to demonstrate success on Arbitrum with a smaller grant initially, the overall consensus is to approve the proposal, acknowledging its potential to drive volume and engagement within the ecosystem.

DeBridge has already demonstrated its value by processing over $200 million in trading volume through Arbitrum, representing a substantial portion of the total volume without any incentives. With the introduction of incentives, these numbers are expected to grow even further.

Kuroro Beasts presented a solid application. They scored well in reach, activity, age, composability, and novelty. In contrast, the application lacked specifics regarding how they plan to incentivizing users in game and why such mechanisms are relevant (execution strategy).
They also lost some points due to allocating 50k (⅓ of their grant request) to marketing campaigns, which leads to the ARB not reaching the hands of users and lacks the ability for oversight. However, they have been very open in reporting data for their marketing initiatives.
Overall, we plan to support this proposal and think it offers the DAO a good opportunity to learn from ARB being spent on marketing efforts. The team has clearly shown their ability to attract users, so we think it’s worth it for the DAO to vote on whether or not they want to support this type of grant.

Stakewise had a strong application based on its product, attractiveness, user base, ability to execute, and potential for long-lasting benefits.
We would’ve liked to have seen Stakewise actively try and expand to Arbitrum prior to the launch of LTIPP, however, given they have demonstrated a strong ability to grow TVL on Ethereum we think their grant size is justified (through their calculations as well).
We appreciate their commitment to match ARB rewards with their native token and ensure that these rewards are committed for 12 months.
Their execution strategy is simple and clear; we would’ve liked to have seen some more innovation than pure liquidity mining but their emphasis on rewarding migration is nice. Furthermore, we like that they will also be attempting to migrate their native governance token. 
We will be supporting this application.

*GFX Feedback)*
The applicant presents a plan that is both simple in execution and easy to monitor. Staked ETH also should be a priority for Arbitrum, as it is a quality, yield-bearing asset, thereby creating a capital flow from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Despite the high request size, we feel the potential gains for Arbitrum outweigh the price tag. We recommend this grant be approved.

*GMX Feedback)*
Unclear if they intend to support native minting as many other liquid derivatives have offered which greatly simplified the process of onboarding capital and continues to reinforce Arbitrum as a primary hub.  The fact that the only reference was a small bridged amount of osETH (via presumably the canonical bridge) makes it seem unlikely; 40% of the incentives are going to incentivize their own native token (it is an 80:20 balancer token so that is potentially still contributing more so to osETH liquidity but again it seems a less productive use of the proceeds for building protocol usage and more towards their token.  Would have been better to see these amounts go towards alternative uses.

The majority of the funds will be used to incentivize their own liquidity pool to deepen liquidity of the osETH/SWISE market and try and bring osETH from mainnet to Arbitrum. The grant size is large and I struggle to see how deep liquidity they may build with osETH will continue once the incentives end. I fail to see how incentivizing their own token liquidity will have a long lasting impact on the DAO and be a good return on investment.

Detailed proposal that scored well in the rubric, namely re: stickiness to retain liquidity post-LTIPP and matching from Stakewise. Growing Arbitrum's share re: staked ETH is important and they've signalled a clear intention to align themselves with Arbitrum over the long term with the migration plans and incentives. The incentive mechanism is pretty straightforward re: liquidity mining.

Limitless’ application was decent and scored average across most criteria. The requested ARB grant is a little on the high side given the age and activity of the protocol, however, is justified well enough.
They have a nice distribution mechanism that targets LPs to stay for a longer period of time through an escrow mechanism which is great. Their protocol is also rather novel and introduces some interesting opportunities for traders on Arbitrum.
Some of their KPIs lacked a bit of justification and seemed rather arbitrary. We would’ve also liked to see additional reward mechanisms that target increasing users and trading volume on the platform.

Limitless presented a decent application overall. While it was difficult to verify the data from the Limitless Beta program and their milestones were not trackable at all, their incentive design is very clearly thought out and specifically promotes retention and stickiness.

Prime’s application was good and scored well across various criteria. Their product is relatively unique with a wide variety of assets, allowing Arbitrum to tap into their existing user base across multiple chains.
Their KPIs, goals, and milestones were clearly displayed with a good amount of justification. They have a solid execution strategy with experience in distributing grants previously, although they could’ve been a bit more innovative in rewarding existing users to move capital or take out loans on Arbitrum.
Their requested grant size is well justified and inline with their current TVL. Our main concern is that there hasn’t been a huge amount of growth or adoption of the protocol.
We will be supporting this application.

Normally this request would be on the large side for the grant plan, but Prime’s cross-chain deployments and stated intention to introduce users on other chains to Arbitrum allow it to score highly enough that we recommend this grant be approved.

*GMX Feedback)*
We would be supporting the proposal. The protocol demonstrates extensive experience in utilizing incentives, as evidenced by their successful implementation with Moonbeam. Their goal of achieving a TVL of $10 million aligns well with their proposed grant amount and appears to be quite feasible. Of particular significance is their strategy to attract users from other ecosystems to Arbitrum, leveraging the same approach that proved effective with Moonbeam. Additionally, they plan to utilize the Prime Points community program to efficiently distribute incentives, further bolstering user adoption on Arbitrum.

The Prime Protocol introduces a compelling concept whereby users can borrow against their liquidity on any chain, facilitating cross-chain liquidity utilization. For instance, users could borrow against their BNB holdings on a different network and access USDC on Arbitrum. This design has the potential to broaden Arbitrum's liquidity base by tapping into external ecosystems while providing users with exposure to Arbitrum's low-cost environment.

This protocol aims to solve a pain point for rebasing tokens, though this is noticeably more of a pain point for issuers whose products suffer than it is for users who may simply opt into different tokens. The protocol is relatively young, with modest success in attracting users.

* Total Value Locked (TVL): $2M (increased cap from $2M to $3M on April 11, 2024)
* Trading Volumes: $13.7M
* Premium: ~$67K for Liquidity Providers (LPs)
* Unique Traders: 166

Even though Smilee has not disclosed any incentives, their TVL increased by more than 15% in a period of market downtrend.

Their product has only recently begun to see substantial growth but is still slightly underwhelming given their age. Nonetheless, the protocol has a decent amount of activity and brings some novel infrastructure to the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Their justification of the grant size is okay but rather ambitious. Given the level of activity on their protocol, the allocated amount of weekly ARB seems high.
They’ve incorporated some nice requirements on both the user and manager side to ensure rewards are going to more genuine users. However, we would’ve liked to see some of their rewards allocated towards a PnL trading league for managers to actively push activity on the platform.

Furthermore, it will certainly help the adoption of LRT tokens on Arbitrum, unlocking greater capital efficiency.
The protocol has seen solid growth since its inception and the team has proven they are effective in managing incentive programs. Lastly, they provided sufficient justifications and calculations for their request grant size.

Rage Trade is submitting an amended proposal per the [Clarified Process for Non-Council Recommended Applications](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clarified-process-for-non-council-recommended-applications-to-move-to-snapshot/23257).
To recap, Rage Trade submitted [a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621) to run weekly and daily trading competitions in the LTIPP initial review round. The proposal aimed to allocate 100% of the LTIPP grant to onboard and reward users via these competitions. The focus was on trading competitions rather than fee rebates because competitions could significantly level the playing field  — ultimately boosting participation. The initial proposal was, however, declined by the council due to two issues: 
- A large ask (1.25M ARB)
- Too few details on how wash trading risks are handled during the competition.

Rage Trade has now made amendments to the initial proposal, including: 
- A reduced ask of 425k ARB 
- Highlighting already existing wash trading measures, including: 
   - Enforcing a minimum trade size
   - Calculating trader ROI based on the average collateral used during a competition round to ensure fairness between large and small traders

### Revised feedback:
- [GFXlabs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/15):
> As one of the initial reviewers, we feel our concerns were addressed and would score this proposal considerably higher. The applicant correctly identified and revised the areas of the grant plan we scored as the weakest and would likely receive a passing grade from GFX if reevaluated formally.
As a reminder, the LTIP pilot rules did not allow applicants the ability to revise after formal submission, and so were not able to react to feedback in real time from reviewers.
As a second reminder, all reviewers have their own opinions and views, and may or may not overlap on some topics.
- [404DAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/16):
> As another reviewer of Rage Trade’s application, we also echo that our initial concerns have been addressed with these revisions. In addition to the revised grant size, Rage Trade has provided a more detailed execution plan that now includes prize distributions and the allocation breakdown between Daily & Weekly competitions. Lastly, we are pleased to see additional thought put towards preventing wash trading in the competitions.
As a delegate, we will be supporting this application once it goes live for a vote.

Contango presented a robust application that features a novel product stack, strong usage metrics and continued alignment with Arbitrum. We also applaud their extensive data provided and thorough execution strategy that was clear and trackable. Current traction looks to be picking up heavily and their grant ask is reasonable. We will be supporting this application.

*Wintermute Feedback*
Contago’s application was clear and concise in describing its objectives, milestones, and KPIs; all of which were sufficiently justified through reasonable calculations. The protocol itself has seen strong growth since its launch and offers a unique product for the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Their incentive mechanism is okay but still gameable by someone remaining delta-neutral through a separate trading venue. We would’ve liked to have seen a better reward system that attempts to encourage activity instead of just holding an open position for a long period of time (e.g., PnL Trading competitions).
Lastly, given their protocol is built on top of other DeFi primitives there are strong second-order effects from activity on the protocol.
We will be supporting this application.

We appreciated that the applicant cited a grant and its results on Optimism. The reward for the incentives was not compelling in that example, however. Also, funding support for as-yet-to-be-determined integration partners is hard to sign off on, since as reviewers, we need to know where the ARB funds will end up. Finally, Gyroscope has almost no presence on Arbitrum according to DeFi Llama, which makes a large grant request difficult to support.

*404 DAO Feedback)*
Gyroscope presented a very thorough application. One that scored very well across most of the rubric. Specifically, they excelled in justifying their KPIs and objectives as it relates to expanding their E-CLPs and expanding their stablecoin integrations. The main concerns were centered around where the majority of their usage has been (Polygon and Optimism) and some lack of clarity around their milestones. Overall, we will be suppporting Gyroscope on the basis of expanding stablecoin innovation and adoption on Arbitrum for what we feel as a very reasonable grant ask.

*GMX Feedback)*
The protocol may not have high numbers on the Arbitrum network currently, but they have demonstrated decent traction on other Layer 2 solutions. GYD stablecoin stands out by implementing a basket of assets for backing, along with automated risk diversification rules. Integration with Frax and Balancer enhances its composability with other ecosystem projects. The proposed $10 million TVL target appears reasonable given their grant ask. The team boasts a solid background, with one founder having published work on Google Scholar. Their effective use of incentives in the past, particularly with Optimism, bodes well for their ability to drive adoption. Leveraging their points system to attract more users seems like a sound strategy, although safeguards against Sybil attacks should be clarified. Overall, Gryoscope aims to introduce a decentralized stablecoin backed by various assets to the Arbitrum ecosystem. With clear KPIs and milestones, they aim to utilize the $100k grant to incentivize and bootstrap their stablecoin for adoption. If they can achieve a $10 million liquidity target, they believe they can kickstart adoption. While Arbitrum lacks decentralized stable value options, Gryoscope has the potential to fill that gap if they can gain traction. The proposal is well-written and outlines their objectives very well.

*Wintermute Feedback)*

Covenant Finance’s application was decent and they provided a clear vision of how they expect to benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their product is unique and introduces a new primitive to DeFi.
Their grant request is not large and their justification is sound. However, we are concerned about their ability to execute given their age and lack of adoption due to Beta and Alpha stages.
Their composability with Uniswap V3 is great and the ability for the protocol to work with long-tail and obscure assets is a great added benefit.
Given they are deployed on Optimism, we feel it should ultimately be up to the DAO to decide whether or not they want to take a risk in funding a potentially new DeFi primitive that improves Arbitrum’s competitive advantage. We will be supporting this application.


*GFX Feedback*
We found this to be an interesting project, and a grant plan that was simple and clear. Unfortunately, the applicant did not quite meet the cutoff where we recommend a grant be approved. Recommend the applicant resubmit in later grants cycles and focus on improving their score in the security and product usage areas. What would make this grant plan much stronger would be to go live, have some success, identify the levers that were pulled to make that happen, and then tailor a grant to scale or reproduce that initial success.

*GMX Feedback*

Covenant Finance aims to bring new debt markets to the Arbitrum and Crypto Markets. The product is innovative as it allows for a perpetual debt which is not currently offered on Arbitrum. The project is able to integrate many of the native debt tokens in the ecosystem including Pendle-YT tokens. Although the project is in early stages I feel the level of innovation the project brings may be a net positive for the ecosystem, the grant size is modest and I think worth the risk for the DAO. The KPIs and milestones also seem reasonable and well thought out. We would be supporting the proposal.

Brahma’s application was very strong and scored well across a lot of criteria. They provided very thorough justifications and explanations of their goals, KPIs, milestones, and how they will benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Their product adds increased utility and features to Safe, making access to DeFi a lot easier for sticker users like DAOs and multisigs.
They provided a great execution strategy that incentivises usage of other Arbitrum DeFi protocols, encourages stickiness, and aims to migrate users to Arbitrum.
Their requested grant size was sufficiently justified. While the project doesn’t have a crazy amount of adoption, these are the types of infrastructure projects the DAO should be supporting.

The applicant’s project is showing signs of traction, and the request amount was justified with target APY, which was helpful, but the target seemed somewhat arbitrary.

Innovative project and well-written proposal across the rubric. Liked the allocation factors and believe there's sufficient diversity to ensure grant goes to the right users within the project. Would like to see further detail on composability and partnerships with other Arbitrum protocols (re: automation/batched routines) and justification behind the grant size and the execution plan to 5x Arbitrum TVL by end of LTIPP but given current organic traction in past few months and exposure Brahma has with other ecos (Blast), believe this is achievable.

Generally, this grant suffered from being a very large request, having milestones that appear extremely easy to meet with the size of the request. We would have preferred to see the applicant highlight something that had already worked well in the past, identified the mechanism responsible, and tailored a grant request to scaling or replicating that past success. The requested amount is simply too much for experimentation unless the plan also includes very rigorous milestones to meet in order to unlock full funding.

 Integral's grant proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy to grow the liquidity on Arbitrum, focusing on enhancing the trading experience and growing platform adoption. The allocation of rewards for LPs and integration efforts with aggregators reflects a well-considered approach to incentivizing participation. The emphasis on sustainable growth, along with proactive engagement with token projects and aggregators, underscores a commitment to long-term ecosystem development. Transparent metrics tracking and milestone setting provide clarity and accountability. With Integral's track record of building highly capital-efficient products, particularly in offering the most efficient swaps, their plan to allocate funds evenly between liquidity incentives and integration support appears sound. The proposed KPIs and milestones align well with the goals of increasing liquidity and fostering ecosystem growth on Arbitrum. Integral's focus on enabling other protocols to integrate and build on top of their platform could contribute significantly to Arbitrum's growth by offering cheaper swaps, attracting more users, and reducing friction. Overall, supporting this proposal could prove to be a mutually beneficial decision for the DAO and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.

Gearbox’s proposal introduces a unique feature called Credit Accounts, an account abstraction primitive that has the potential to attract significant capital to Arbitrum. The objectives outlined in the proposal are clear, well-defined, and aligned with driving growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their execution strategy, incorporating mechanisms such as farming and incentivizing margin trading, demonstrates a thoughtful approach to achieving the program's goals. The allocation of resources and incentives across different pools and strategies reflects a strategic focus on driving user engagement and liquidity provision.


The proposed timeline and milestones are realistic, offering a clear pathway for assessing progress throughout the grant period. Emphasizing target utilization ratios and total transaction volume underscores a commitment to driving user adoption and engagement, vital for the success of any protocol. Furthermore, their strategy to incentivize stickiness through continued integration with other protocols highlights a long-term commitment to enhancing composability within the ecosystem, benefiting not only Gearbox but also other projects and the overall Arbitrum ecosystem.


Additionally, Gearbox has a proven track record of innovation, attracting users with both simplistic interfaces and high yields, such as their leveraged ETH EigenPoint system. The grant size appears modest considering the value Gearbox brings to the ecosystem, enabling users to explore new DeFi strategies with ease. With a history of successfully gathering TVL using their own incentives, coupled with the Arb Grant, Gearbox is expected to attract even more TVL.

Vaultka has a proven track record of delivering impactful grants, as demonstrated by their successful utilization of the GMX grant. The proposal stands out for its detailed timeline and milestone breakdown, which fosters accountability and facilitates progress monitoring throughout the program's implementation. Innovative incentive mechanisms, such as enhanced Vaultka NFT rewards, are introduced, showcasing Vaultka's commitment to fostering user engagement and retention. Moreover, the proposal's focus on creating a flywheel effect bodes well for both users and projects on Vaultka's platform, aligning with our sustainability goals. Additionally, Vaultka's early adoption of protocols and their significant TVL growth with various vaults highlight their pioneering role in the DeFi ecosystem. While the requested 1 million Arb Grant may seem substantial, supporting Arbitrum Native protocols like Vaultka, especially those introducing unique strategies, is crucial for the ecosystem's growth. The proposal's aim to attract significant TVL to their platform promises to benefit the broader ecosystem and attract new users. We would be inclined to support the proposal.

Strong proposal that scored well on rubric. Protocol has great traction on BSC and as evidenced in their various dashboards, and is an opportunity to draw a net new market to Arbitrum. Would have liked to see the following: (i) more granularity in milestones to highlight other key KPIs applied weekly/biweekly instead of monthly; and (ii) more detail behind stickiness strategies as they lightly touched on (centered around community and product delight) with a focus on rewarding ARB holders vs. driving stickiness of users/usage/liquidity + touching on strategy after incentives end

APX scored well across a variety of categories and presented a thorough application. Links for team members would have been appreciated to verify the content they have presented. We felt their trading competition left a lot of details out relating to sybil attacks & wash trading. We appreciate the attempt to make the trading competition social in creating teams, but focusing around a volume based challenge rewards larger users to come together to maximize their allocation. Unfortunately we will not be supporting this proposal

*GMX Feedback*
The proposal outlines a detailed plan for increasing TVL and trading volume on Arbitrum, accompanied by clear objectives and execution strategies. However, the milestones set are too low. Currently, the proposal suggests spending on incentives to create a $5 million pool on Arbitrum, but most trading is expected to occur on BSC rather than Arbitrum. While the team trading contest is a novel and promising idea, unfortunately, we cannot support the proposal.

APX Finance’s application was thorough in their justification and details. They have proven their ability to natively run their own incentive programs which has worked out well. The unification of cross-chain liquidity will be a win for Arbitrum and their execution strategy seems sufficient.

Factor scored well across a majority of the rubric. We appreciate the team’s commitment to Arbitrum and their continued Arbitrum native roadmap. Additionally, the product has started to catch some traction with their recent incentives mechanism. While their grant ask is a little high for their current usage, we believe the incentives can compliment their recent traction and support further protocol growth benefits. However, their incentive design(bribe mechanism based on veFCTR) does lead to the potential of weak distribution, mainly whales and OGs receiving the majority of rewards. Overall, we feel the benefits outweigh the costs and we support this application. 

*GMX Feedback)*
We are generally supportive of Factor’s grant application. They have been present in the space for a while with a provable track record and the grant ask seems responsible, along with their proposed plan of action for the grants. Considering Factor is currently in the rollout stage of the product they have spent a long time building, I expect the grant to strengthen this process and be quite cost-effective and based on Factor's incentive strategy outlined in their proposal, We would be inclined to accept the proposal. The strategy demonstrates a clear understanding of how to incentivize user adoption and liquidity depth within the Factor ecosystem on Arbitrum. By leveraging dynamic reward allocation, targeted boost incentives, and enhanced rewards for veFCTR holders, Factor aims to create stickiness among users and ensure sustained engagement over time. The proposed KPIs are well-defined and directly align with the grant objectives, providing clear metrics for evaluating success. Additionally, the milestones set forth are ambitious yet realistic, with a clear roadmap for achieving them over the 12-week grant period. Overall, Factor's incentive strategy appears robust and well-thought-out, making it a compelling proposal for acceptance.

This application was clear and concise in describing their objectives, KPIs, and milestones. While the protocol does not necessarily bring anything new to Arbitrum, it is one of the more reasonable grant requests for bridging protocols. Furthermore, we appreciate the marketing efforts with Galxe to increase awareness and funnel users to Arbitrum.
Not sure if it was implied under cross-chain swaps, but it would’ve been good to see Symbiosis incentivize cross-chain swaps into DeFi protocols on Arbitrum.

This grant plan focuses directly on lowering the cost to bridge onto Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova by subsidizing the gas costs to bridge in. While a 100% rebate may offer some niche griefing attack by someone seeking to drain the grant funds, they probably would not have a profit motive to do so. The request is reasonable in size, the plan easy to measure, and directly targets increasing the number of assets and users on Arbitrum. We recommend this grant be approved.

We greatly appreciated how this took data from a previous success story and sought to replicate it! That’s what allows for large grants requests.

I am generally positive about supporting Index Coop’s application. They have a novel product, which has an offchain reach demonstrated by their partnership with eToro, CoinDesk and 21.co. In anticipation of RobinHood integrating Arbitrum to their app product-offering, and in consideration of the immense reach of mobile apps, I think that should Index Coop be successful it would greatly benefit Arbitrum as an ecosystem as well.

Pear Protocol presents a product that is novel to Arbitrum and successfully leverages other protocols in the ecosystem. They have justified their grant request with a detailed execution strategy and solid KPIs. We felt like their application could have provided more detailed milestones and the distribution of the incentives is a concern as they will likely end up in the hands of a few users. However, this is a protocol with history of building on Arbitrum and we believe incentivizing its full public launch will improve Arbitrum’s competitiveness. 

*Wintermute Feedback)*
This application was good and scored decently across some criteria. Their product is unique and we like that it is built on top of existing protocols. They had some solid justification and calculation of KPIs, milestones, and goals, however, their estimations don’t really justify their grant size given the protocol’s current usage.

They could’ve also improved on their incentive design allocating some rewards to running trading competitions (which actively drive user engagement).

While we are aware the protocol is in a private beta, looking at their Dune dashboard there is 1 active daily users indicating very low signs of adoption. We would typically be against supporting an application of this size and grant request, however, their milestone ARB unlocks provide sufficient protection for the DAO.

We will be supporting this application.

I’m generally supportive of this grant from Peapods Finance. The tokenization and capitalization of volatility is a novel offering enabled by DeFi and smart contract capabilities.

However, I do wonder about the stickiness of the users they are able to attract. Much like other DeFi exotic assets and platforms Voltz Finance for example), the depth of reach for exotic DeFi assets is still outside the real of even mainstream onchain adoption. Some more background on the growth AND maturity of their current mainnet TVL has developed so the Peapods team could give more insight into potential future prospects would be helpful in their future grant endavors

Given the virality of Beacon’s demo back in 2022, we are confident that incentivizing the launch of their “New Frontier Quest” launch will bring value to Arbitrum. There are multiple ways to incentive user activity - completing in-game quests, referrals, daily logins, etc - which we believe will likely bring in new users. While the overall execution strategy is lacking important details for an ask of this size, the other aspects of the application have led us to support this grant. Additionally, we’re under the impression that Beacon does not need a security audit for their NFTs and have therefore not graded them on this aspect. 

*Wintermute Feedback)*
The Beacon’s application scored decently across a range of criteria. They have seen strong success during their demo phase which clearly shows their ability to attract users to Arbitrum and stimulate network activity. The product/industry is appealing to a wide variety of users inside and outside of Arbitrum and if successful creates a competitive advantage for Arbitrum.

The main concerns we had with this proposal were its lack of ARB distribution details and justification for grant size. They had a general idea of how they intend to distribute rewards but there was no granular breakdown on how much ARB will be allocated to each sub-sections. There is also very little discussion about sybil protections and the protocol has no audit history.

Overall, given the positive points mentioned above, we think the application should be progressed to a DAO vote, however, we urge the DAO to take into consideration the areas of concern highlighted.

The Beacon’s application demonstrates a well-rounded approach, showcasing success and achieving product-market fit in attracting users to Arbitrum.

LogX’s application was solid and scored well across most criteria. They excelled in their grant, milestone, and KPI justifications, providing very clear objectives and calculations. Their grant size is on the larger size, but the team has demonstrated their ability to execute on effective incentive programs that they have been running for some time. We like their emphasis on targeting CEX users and how they intend to achieve this.
The main things lacking from this proposal was lack of data, novelty, and contribution to Arbitrum’s competitive advantage. The latter stems from Arbitrum’s abundance of Perp DEXs, but LogX provides some interesting product features.

GammaSwap’s application was good and scored well across a range of criteria. They provide clear and concise explanations of their milestones, KPIs, and objectives.
Their product is innovative and unique and attempts to solve a major problem for one of the largest DeFi categories. We really like their esARB mechanism which should create a notable amount of supply side benefits post LTIPP. Their execution strategy is sound and their TVL estimations and calculations are sufficiently justified.
Unfortunately, they are a niche product that is complex and may not appeal to a lot of users which is indicated in their lack of adoption. Nonetheless, there still seems to be some baseline of activity.
Their requested grant size is on the larger end for their protocol usage, however, given the points above we think it’s sufficiently justified.

This application largely suffered from being a very large request relative to the TVL and age of the protocol. It would also have benefited from more details around under what conditions or guidelines the incentives would be deployed, as they currently appear to be very discretionary for the applicant.

The full proposal can be found here: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/connext-ltipp-application-final/21579/8

 The council feedback could be summarized as:

* Incentives should go more towards users
* Lack of benchmarking with other bridging projects to justify LP requests

## Key facts about Connext:

* Connext is positioned as a B2B2C protocol, serving apps (and indirectly their users). The protocol has experienced tremendous growth with innovations like its Restaking from Anywhere module, which allows users to restake their LRT from Arbitrum.
* Connext facilitated and brought more than **$285m of LRTs to Arbitrum** in the last 3 months.
* Connext volume through Arbitrum in the last 30 days was $280m

**Connext wants Arbitrum to succeed, and their priority remains to attract more users to bridge into Arbitrum and Restake ETH on the L2.**

## Goal of the LTIPP incentives
Increase ETH TVL in the pools to provide better pricing for its integrated apps and their users

How (new strategy post feedback):
incentivizing users who bridge into Arbitrum by subsidizing part of the bridging fees. This will further boost the utilization of the pools which will attract more liquidity. Higher TVL enables the best pricing when the Restaking module is used.

Incentivizing users to bridge into Arbitrum has 2 benefits:

1. It helps more users to bridge away from mainnet fees, onboarding them permanently onto Arbitrum
2. It helps to rebalance the AMM pool, as the restaking activity tends to unbalance the pool in the opposite direction. Having a balanced pool means that users restaking ETH don’t incur a negative price impact.

## Changes from previous requests:

* **Remove any liquidity incentivization for  routers and LPs, and shift focus towards users** 
* **Refund 95% of the fees to the users bridging into Arbitrum, up to 13bps**. Fees vary depending on the origin chain (from mainnet it’s 9bps, from other L2s, 13bps) so only the actual fees incurred will be refunded.
Fees will only be subsidized to users who are onboarding to Arbitrum (from any other network), and users exiting Arbitrum will not get subsidized.
This is fully aligned with other crosschain protocols that saw their requests approved.

The estimate (according to the average of the last 7 days at the time of writing the original proposal) is for users to bridge 137k ETH during the pilot program.

Bridging fee rebate: 137,000 * 0.0013 (max fee) * 0.95 = 169 ETH

Tot ask: 446,472 ARB (1 ETH = 2,646.75 ARB at the time of writing)

Note: pricing the ask in ARB vs ETH as the pair is less volatile

## Expected milestones

Month 1: 45k ETH bridged into Arbitrum (30% of ARB distributed)

Month 2: 90k ETH bridged (60% of ARB)

Month 3: 137k ETH bridged ($100% of ARB)

Key points include Connext's growth, significant contribution to Arbitrum ($285m of LRT in the last 3 months and $280m volume in the last 30 days), and its priority to attract more users to bridge into Arbitrum and restake ETH on the L2.

The new strategy aims to incentivize users by subsidizing part of bridging fees, boosting pool utilization and liquidity, and rebalancing AMM pools. The proposal removes any liquidity incentives for routers and LPs, focusing instead on users, and refunds 95% of the fees to users bridging into Arbitrum, up to 13bps.

Following Uniswap’s successful deployment on the Scroll testnet, the Scroll team is proposing that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll's upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official deployment.

Point of Contact: [ Lea Schmitt, E-mail: lea@scroll.io]

## Overview of our Proposal

We propose that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll's upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official, canonical deployment. Uniswap V3 has already been deployed to Scroll’s testnet, and the Uniswap router has processed over 1.8M transactions there.

* Scroll is a bytecode equivalent zk-rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum.
* Scroll is an open-source project developed in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation Privacy and Scaling Explorations organization. It was built with the community, for the community.
* Our community ethos and vision are aligned with Ethereum. We are committed to a secure, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and efficient future that Ethereum offers through our plans to decentralize Scroll sequencers and provers.

We propose that Uniswap will showcase this by integrating Scroll into its user interface.

## Motivation

Uniswap being deployed on multiple Ethereum L2s is integral for encouraging competition and diversity of technical solutions to scale Ethereum. We believe that Uniswap's community and the ecosystem that Scroll strives for are closely aligned. Both projects are building trustless, decentralized, and secure financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone, regardless of merit or location. Deploying to Scroll offers many benefits, including significant user savings, an expanded user base, capturing the zkEVM market, and fostering L2 native innovation.

* This deployment positions Uniswap as an early mover and captures a rapidly growing market as the Ethereum ecosystem gradually shifts to zkEVMs.

* Uniswap on Scroll will integrate closely with Scroll's rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to deploying on our mainnet, and many are deployed on our testnet: AAVE, Lens, the Graph, Covalent, Safe, and Etherscan to name a few. Given the excitement around Scroll and current usage of our testnet, we expect hundreds of projects to deploy on our mainnet post-launch.

* Importantly, Uniswap on Scroll will propel L2 DEX innovation. We are on the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum L1. Scroll will bring new developers and ecosystem integrations to Uniswap.

## Success Criteria

Deployment of Uniswap on Scroll will:
* Increase Uniswap TVL, targeting $100M within two months of deployment Grow * Uniswap order volume
* Enable listing of new assets on Uniswap that are unique to Scroll

Moreover, Scroll will bring its dedicated and expanding developer community to Uniswap, thereby boosting the growth of Uniswap's developer community.

The best way to measure success for Uniswap on Scroll is to focus on TVL and transaction volumes. We think that Scroll can deliver an additional $100M of TVL to Uniswap within two months of launch.

## Protocol Security

ZK-Rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography rather than unreliable crypto-economics.

Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 canonical bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the roll-up mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than relayer-based bridges.

Security is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM, which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we are working with two external auditing companies to audit our bridge code, and we have an in-house security team that continuously reviews our codebase. 

We plan to launch with a timelock delay and a security council to control privileged functions and contract upgrades. Finally, shortly after launch, we will introduce distributed sequencer operators.

## Deployment

After the Temperature Check, we will move forward with deploying Uniswap V3 on our Scroll mainnet, following which we will submit the Governance Proposal with the addition of the deployed contract addresses. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is effortless to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take a few hours.

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the following Uniswap v3 contracts [to be filled in after deployment] to be deemed as the canonical Uniswap deployment on Scroll. This deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to reference the Uniswap v3 Factory contract on Scroll following the process outlined here: [Post-BSL Cross-chain Deployment Process & New Uniswap.eth Subdomain](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20878).

Per andy8052 on the [Uniswap forums](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-to-arbitrum-mainnet/12451):
...there is immense value in being available for swaps on every EVM compatible network. Since there is no liquidity mining, it is hard to make the case that multiple deployments will segment liquidity, and long term if this is an issue governance can flip the switch on liquidity incentives for the chains it desires deepest liquidity. In the meantime, not deploying to new and growing networks like Arbitrum and Matic just allows for other exchanges to come in and fill that spot. This could potentially eat into fees earned by governance in the future.

Alongside this, it will help to grow the potential list of projects that can be built on Uniswap v3. Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing with and using the v3 codebase will only expedite Uniswap adoption on all chains as the code and integrations become more battle tested.

Arbitrum launches later this week on May 28th. I think it would be best to start a discussion ASAP around deploying the Uniswap v3 code to Arbitrum network.

title: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding Phase III  
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic  
created: 2024-06-11

---

# Summary

This publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) with 600k GHO to continue supporting GHO's liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next three months on Ethereum.

The ALC will be funded by 375,000 ARB on Arbitrum from the LTIPP submission by the @ACI.

# Motivation

As GHO continues to grow on Ethereum, there is an increasing need for deeper liquidity to facilitate greater swap sizes with minimal price impact. Providing a great UX for larger swaps is a prerequisite for enabling more sophisticated and larger DeFi users to transition into GHO.

As GHO expands to other networks, like Arbitrum with others to follow, the ALC aims to develop a liquidity strategy and drive efforts that create utility to support the adoption of GHO on each new deployment.

## Ethereum

### Phase II Update

Over the last three months, the Aave Liquidity Committee has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes and coordinated several key initiatives, leading to improved swap conditions.

Some of the notable achievements are mentioned below:

* GHO trading at peg
* Deeper on-chain DEX liquidity (Increase from 13M to over 32M)
* Borrow Cap increased from 32M to 85M 
* Improved peg resilience
* Both USDC and USDT GSMs are funded
* Cowswap & Paraswap have integrated various GHO liquidity pool types
* Cowswap has integrated both USDC and USDT GSMs

In combination with other efforts like stkGHO, ALC-led initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHO's peg recovery. The peg has recovered, the two GSMs are funded, and there is now over 32M in DEX liquidity pools. The vast majority of the DEX liquidity is nominated in the non-GHO trading pair.

Maverick has been a critical tool for helping recover the peg. As GHO appreciated, several Boosted Positions were deployed providing additional liquidity depth to prevent GHO from retracing. With the imminent launch of Maverick v2, new pools will be deployed and liquidity will be reconstructed to reflect recent trading history.

### Phase III Lookahead

As GHO continues to grow, there is a genuine requirement for deeper liquidity to accommodate larger swaps on a more consistent basis. During Phase III, the ALC will focus on the following key areas:

* Reduced price volatility
* Deeper structured concentrated liquidity
* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools

With several ongoing efforts to onboard larger GHO users, this creates a need to consistently accommodate increasingly larger swaps with minimal price impact. In the months ahead we expect several builders to transition to GHO.

Achieving 50M of DEX liquidity across various integrations remains a key focus. Initiatives like adding the GHO/USDC ECLP to the Safety Module (SM) will help achieve this goal. Other efforts include increasing the amplification on the Balancer 3pool, which are also helping facilitate larger swaps. The anticipated Maverick airdrop is also expected to contribute towards growing liquidity by complementing GHO emissions.

Supporting the growth of GHO utility in collaboration with Aave Grants DAO has resulted in several integrations. The ALC will continue to promote integrations and create utility supporting broader adoption.

In the near term, we expect broader market conditions to improve. This is likely to result in increased liquidity costs for sustaining existing LP deposits and also elevated costs for attracting new liquidity deposits. The ALC is receiving feedback from various fund managers of increasing hurdle rate expectations for new capital deployments. This can largely be attributed to opportunity costs and risk-adjusted returns from competing yield sources.

The proposed Ethereum budget for Phase III:

| Objective | Previous Budget | Proposed Budget   |
| --------  | :--------:  | :--------: |
| Liquidity  + Utility | 500,000 GHO | 600,000 GHO |

## Arbitrum

With the launch of GHO on Arbitrum being imminent, the ALC aims to design a liquidity strategy and support creating utility for GHO within the ecosystem. The initial strategy is likely to feature ECLPs on Balancer via Gyroscope, concentrated liquidity on Maverick v2 when deployed, and possibly other DEXes.

A general update on GHO's liquidity launch is mentioned below:

* GHO/(a)USDC ECLP - Included in the Arbitrum SM
* GHO/USDe ECLP - Partnership with Ethena, Gyroscope, and Balancer
* (d)GHO/GYD ECLP - Partnership with Gyroscope and possibly Gearbox
* GHO/USDC/USDT - Balancer v2
* GHO/USDC - Maverick v2 upon launch

Other pools are being evaluated as we progressively work towards finalising the GHO launch liquidity plans.

The proposed Arbitrum budget for Phase III, which excludes SM Emission, is shown below:

| Objective | Proposed Budget |
| --------  | :--------:  |
| Liquidity  + Utility (excl. SM) | 375,000 ARB |

## Performance Metrics

The below details some high-level GHO metrics we propose tracking:

| Description | Ethereum Value | Arbitrum Value |
| --------  | :--------:  | :--------:  |
| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M | 30M |
| TVL Utility Liquidity Pools (Excl. stkGHO)  | 15M  | 10M |
| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |
| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap (GHO to USDC) | < 0.10%  | < 0.25%  |
| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  | < 5.00%  |
| Price level for >90% time | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO) |

Please note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next three months. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.

# Specification

Of the 2M GHO held by the ALC from AIP-115, 600,000 GHO shall be retained by the ALC and the remaining 1.4M transferred to the collector contract.

### Summary

Initially launched at the end of 2021, Optimism is an EVM equivalent L2 scaling solution. Optimism currently supports 100+ dapps and over $500m in on-chain value. Optimism drastically improves Ethereum’s scalability while retaining its security through rollup technology - having already saved its users over $1B in gas fees.

The OP token is a governance token for the Optimism Collective. OP holders are currently able to vote on various decisions impacting the Collective, including the grants, protocol upgrades, inflation adjustments, and other fundamental changes. The Collective is committed to an [iterative governance system](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/r888e4B5iiNQi-3_mO26ixgv-plQ099XWgqEOv9iWKA) that will evolve dynamically over time.

Optimism hopes to use the launch of this token to establish a deeper partnership between the Optimism and Aave communities. This proposal would enable OP as collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism.

### Motivation

With the recent release of the OP token, we want to bolster initial growth for Aave V3 on Optimism. This will benefit the Aave community by creating a vibrant ecosystem around Aave V3, while being a strong first use case for OP.

**Aave would be one of the first platforms to support OP as collateral.** The OP token is one of the first and leading rollup technology ecosystem tokens, so the Aave community would be supporting the scaling of Ethereum and onboard the cohort of users coming with it. L2s being the home for AAVE v3 could also gain a lot from this synergy.

Overall, the use cases will create the opportunity to continue growing liquidity and usage of the Aave v3 pools on Optimism.

### Specifications

The Optimism Foundation is submitting this ARC. The Foundation is a Cayman Islands foundation company. It serves as a steward for the healthy, sustainable development of the Optimism ecosystem.

As noted above, the OP token is a governance token for the Optimism Collective. At genesis there was an initial total supply of 4,294,967,296 OP tokens. The total token supply is set to inflate at a rate of 2% per year, unless changed through governance. ![|624x311](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eUzmlwxkHKo2tjFytMNLOfB5PGOB4dGk09Os1EqJdQmTcCB6vpFQjF0JwZAmQNqgStz52VnNh7oD73rDSCkevjOUtivLDe7Kfp4YbjvkqtFtL68GoqGgrxdzbm9NAtUPwTQC96d76kM7U0y87Zi9_Q)

Since Aave v3 pools were recently deployed on Optimism, the use of OP as a collateral asset is the next logical step. We expect it would be the ideal home for OP pools on Aave, and for it to drive large amounts of volume to these pools. A strong bond between Optimism and Aave is a benefit to both communities. To fully realize this integration, OP would need to be added as collateral.

### Title: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market
### Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
###  Date: 2024-06-04

---

### **Summary**
This proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. 

### **Motivation**

Artemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.

artMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).

artMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.

### Benefits of listing artMETIS

We believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.

- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.
- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.
- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.
- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.

### Chain to be deployed/listed

artMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.

Ticker: artMETIS

Contract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)

Chainlink Oracle: 0x96C4A48Abdf781e9c931cfA92EC0167Ba219ad8E

Risk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.

### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:

The Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.

Furthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.

Artemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.

In recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.

In summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.

## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative
## Date: 2023-08-23
---


## Summary

This ARFC proposes an increase in the borrow rate of GHO from the current rate of 1.5% to 2.5%. The aim is to address the peg deviation of GHO and ensure its growth and trustworthiness in the market.


## Motivation

GHO has witnessed a rapid growth, reaching a circulating supply of 22M in just a few weeks since its launch. One of the primary reasons for this growth, especially in the current adverse market conditions, is the GHO borrow rate set below the market price of stablecoin borrows. This low rate, combined with the current lack of holding venues and the inability to use GHO as collateral, has made single-side liquidity provision in stableswaps, such as Balancer pools, [one of the most sought-after strategies.](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity)

While deep liquidity and growth are desired as a go-to-market strategy for GHO, the peg deviation of GHO (currently around $0.975) is affecting its growth and trust in the market. A consensus short-term solution to this issue is to slightly raise the GHO borrow rate from 1.5% to 2.5%. This rate remains attractive for borrowers and is still below the market average rates. However, by reducing the discount, it is anticipated to have a positive effect.

This proposal is particularly relevant in the context of the potential [sDAI onboarding integration](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sdai-aave-v3-onboarding/14410). This integration is expected to add short-term sell pressure on GHO, especially with the current borrow rate, which could further harm the GHO peg.

The discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.

## Specification

- **Asset**: GHO
- **Contract Address**: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f
- **Current Borrow Rate**: 1.5%
- **Proposed Borrow Rate**: 2.5%
- **New discounted Borrow Rate**: ~1.75%

## Disclamer

The Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this TEMP CHECK.

## Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.
3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, implement the proposed changes to the GHO borrow rate.

Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.
Proposal
Founded in 2019, Metis launched its Layer 2 mainnet on November 19, 2021. We are building a hub for the entire Web3 economy in 3 stages: Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution with fast and cheap transactions; no-code integration via a middleware layer powered by smart contract templates; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) infrastructure enabling both blockchain and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain, with all the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.
A mere eight weeks after launching Andromeda mainnet, Metis TVL surpassed the majority of its competitors, surging to the #3 spot as measured by L2Beat and reaching $500M+ TVL. As the fastest growing L2, Metis has taken the blockchain world by storm with its Optimistic Rollup technology, EVM-Equivalence, and incredible mutually-incentivized ecosystem. With a robust and secure infrastructure, a self-deployed Graph node, multiple oracle providers, on-chain explorers, and a dedicated integrations team ready to assist throughout every step of the porting process, Metis is ready for Aave integration.
Metis envisions and supports a multichain future and seeks to invite Aave to expand its own mission of creating a multichain future, by having Aave enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, and while there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, having a Flagship protocol like Aave would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while fulfilling Aave’s multichain expansion. As well, there are many benefits Aave users and the DAO at large would benefit from.
Metis’ commitment to a decentralized future is built into its very structure, including the ethos of creating a sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem where its partners are set up to thrive. This is best exemplified by Metis’ Builder Mining Program. This program allows all DApps deployed on Andromeda to directly participate in the revenue Metis generates. For example: if Aave deployed on Andromeda, 30% of the fees accrued from every single transaction occurring through Aave would be kicked back directly back to Aave, in perpetuity.
The mission at Metis is to provide the infrastructure and incentive system to make deployment on our network a no-brainer. This additional revenue will be going to the Aave DAO’s treasury and as such, will be able to be utilized as seen fit by the Aave community at large.
Metis also has some of the fastest transactions in blockchain, often executing faster than your web browser can process them, and always executing faster than MetaMask can record them. Transactions on our Layer 2 network currently cost about $2-$3, considerably less than the gas fees on Layer 1 Ethereum. Metis will launch its own storage layer by the end of Q1 2022, which will enable cheap, secure storage of NFTs and other large blocks of data, while doubling as an additional scalability layer; as a result, transaction fees will drop to just cents by the end of Q1 2022.
The traction earned by our popular DeFi protocols are great case studies to the adoption and eagerness of the Metis community to engage with our DeFi ecosystem. Netswap, the first ever native Layer 2 DEX, surpassed $1B in trading volume in its first month of operation. Likewise, popular yield optimization protocols Beefy Finance and Pickle Finance have achieved great success since integrating and launching their protocols on Andromeda.
Metis is open and willing to work with Aave to determine the optimal strategy for liquidity incentivization, marketing and awareness campaigns, and additional benefits to bring to its users. We are considering the options of qualifying airdrops for interaction with the protocol on Andromeda and building Reputation Power (allowing for future whitelisting opportunities) for Aave holders voting on this proposal. We will also offer Aave the opportunity to set up a Verifier node for the Metis Layer 2 network, providing a steady stream of income to the Aave DAO in perpetuity and aligning incentives for the future decentralization and wellbeing of the Metis network.
Metis is ready to onboard Aave to its ecosystem and looks forward to the opportunity to build a long-term, sustainable, and mutually-beneficial relationship.

Title: [ARFC] ""Merit is Forever"" Reward System Program Extension
Date: 2024-04-11
Author: Marc Zeller - Aave-Chan Initiative
---

## Summary:

Following the success of Merit's first two rounds, this ARFC proposes the long-term adoption of the Merit reward system for the DAO and allocating a 5m$/quarter budget for the next 12 months.

## Motivation:

Merit was designed to address two main objectives:

1. Counteract the negative impact of Morpho optimizer on Aave DAO revenue by attracting Ethereum back from Morpho. Merit Round 1 resulted in approximately 165k ETH leaving Morpho and growing Aave's market share. The Morpho product is now imbalanced (limited to a 52k ETH capacity), ensuring it will not offer additional yield on top of Aave, thus achieving its primary goal.
2. Support the GHO stablecoin peg, fostering supply growth and revenue expansion while maintaining a stablecoin base for the safety module:

   - StkGho supply increased by 45%.
   - GHO supply grew by 40%.
   - The GHO borrow rate was increased to 13.8%.
   - GHO peg remained within target rate 97% of the time.
   - GHO protocol revenue grew significantly, reaching approximately 6.5m$/year.

Merit Round 2 involved 1367 eligible users, with Staker & Strakoor being the largest booster (over 100 users), indicating a strong user trust in the Aave protocol and willingness to participate in the Safety module for yield and discounted GHO borrowings.

Building on these positive outcomes from the first two Merit rounds, the ACI proposes extending the funding of Merit for an additional four periods (three merit rounds per period). This proposal would approve Merit's continuation for the next 12 months.

### Operational aspects:

We propose Aave Finance incorporates Merit funding within their Treasury Management AIPs if this proposal is approved by a DAO snapshot vote. Our successful collaboration with Angle Protocol and their Merkl product will continue, with the ACI producing user-friendly applications for Merit beneficiaries and providing relevant data to the DAO.

At present, we do not propose making any changes to boosters or diluters within Merit; however, ad-hoc ARFC snapshot votes can be used by the DAO to modify these aspects of Merit at any time.

### Budget considerations:

The Aave DAO currently enjoys an excess annual net profit of 80m$. The ACI considers allocating 20m$/year to Merit a worthwhile investment, as it supports Aave protocol market shares and boosts DAO revenue. The expected returns, particularly with GHO, are anticipated to be noteworthy.

Should the DAO decide to discontinue Merit due to unsatisfactory returns or lower profits stemming from market conditions in the future, an ad-hoc ARFC vote can terminate Merit funding and limit budget exposure.

### Learnings from the previous rounds:

1. The wETH ""spray & pray"" approach has been underwhelming for most users due to the large scale of Ethereum borrowing on Aave (2B$). Despite this, wETH Merit was a resounding success in achieving its goals through the behavior of a subset of ""whales"" who recognize the value of Merit based on their substantial positions.

To address this, this proposal grants flexibility to Aave Finance and the ACI to allocate a part of the wETH Merit budget towards targeting influential users.

2. The Ethereum-centric nature of the GHO Merit program generated some minor backlash due to high Ethereum network transaction fees. With the introduction of cross-chain GHO, we have an opportunity to deploy a ""cross-chain"" merit system in collaboration with L2 safety modules and L2 StkGHO.

To achieve this goal, this ARFC grants flexibility to Aave Finance and the ACI to allocate a portion of Merit budget to L2 markets following the deployment of cross-chain GHO.

3. Some ""sleepy"" liquidity will likely never claim merit airdrops. To increase program efficiency and resource allocation optimization, this proposal greenlights redistributing unclaimed funds to subsequent merit rounds if a user hasn't claimed during six merit rounds.
As an example, unclaimed funds from Round 1 can be allocated to boost the Round 7 budget. 

## Specification:

If this proposal is approved by a snapshot YAE vote, Aave finance will incorporate Merit budget within their monthly Treasury Management AIPs. Funds management will continue to be handled by the  [Merit Safe wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdeadD8aB03075b7FBA81864202a2f59EE25B312b), and Angle's Merkl contracts will still handle distribution.

HAL makes it simple to monitor and build automated workflows based on real-time blockchain data. Our mission is to ""glue"" together centralised and decentralised technologies (https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-gluing-manifesto-159cabef0532) to help the ecosystem strive. By leveraging push notifications, DAOs can increase user engagements and provide additional value to their members.

This proposal looks to embed the HAL notification system into the Aave UI.

### Motivation

Given the market volatility, it is critical for Aave's lenders and borrowers to carefully monitor their positions to prevent liquidation. HAL's Aave recipes (https://9000.hal.xyz/aave) are already used by thousands of users for risk management.

Adding HAL into the Aave UI will unlock additional level of protocol engagement and security for all Aave users.

### Benefits for the Aave community

The integration would allow all AAVE users to be notified about the status of their Health Factor. Using our recipe, AAVE users can be notified in real time on the health factor conditions of their position, thus greatly reducing the risk of being liquidated.

Moreover, this integration increases the trust within the AAVE community, allowing anyone to have access to information on the health factor in a straightforward form and with the possibility of receiving a notification via Email, Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Slack and Webhook. We already witnessed a similar positive feedback loop in the past when we did a similar integration with Bancor (https://twitter.com/HAL_Team/status/1389945442818011140).

title: Add TerraUSD to Aave V2
status: ARC posted, pending snapshot vote
author: @larry0x
shortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for UST
ARC discussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-support-for-terra-usd-ust/6003
created: 2021-11-09
updated: N/A
---

## Simple Summary

TerraUSD (UST) is an algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin issued on the Terra blockchain. Its market capitalization has grown to [almost $2.8B](​https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-usd​) since its inception on October 1. UST is designed such that each UST can be redeemed for $1 of LUNA, and vice versa. This has kept the price close to the peg, which is essential for a stablecoin.

## Motivation

Terra is committed to a multi-chain strategy and as such are motivated to find vibrant borrowing/lending markets for UST on all of the chains where UST is supported. Ethereum continues to be the top destination for assets from the Terra ecosystem.

UST is supported by major dApps including Curve, Uniswap, Sushi, Harvest, etc. UST can also be deposited into Mirror Protocol mAsset pools on Uniswap, and is depositable into Anchor via [EthAnchor](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/developers-ethereum/ethanchor). We believe there will be sufficient demand for borrowing/lending given the variety of existing use cases.

Finally, as referenced earlier, Terra has begun its migration from its centrally held bridge to [Wormhole](https://twitter.com/wormholecrypto). This move should lower the centralization risks associated with UST while increasing its adoption case as it reaches more chains via Wormhole in the future.

## Proposed Parameters

UST will be used both as collateral and for borrowing. We proposed the same parameters used for DAI:

```typescript
export const strategyUST: IReserveParams = {
  optimalUtilizationRate: new BigNumber(0.8).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  baseVariableBorrowRate: new BigNumber(0).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  variableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.04).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  variableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(0.75).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  stableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.02).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  stableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(0.75).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),
  baseLTVAsCollateral: '7500',
  liquidationThreshold: '8000',
  liquidationBonus: '10500',
  borrowingEnabled: true,
  stableBorrowRateEnabled: true,
  reserveDecimals: '18',

SEBA submits a proposal to Aave Governance for adding SEBA Bank as a “Whitelister” to Aave Arc.

SEBA is a licensed and supervised Swiss Bank providing a seamless and secure bridge between digital and traditional assets. SEBA serves professional and institutional clients which include top-tier private banks, asset managers and crypto companies. The interest of SEBA’s clients and prospects for crypto earning products has grown substantially overtime. Initially lending crypto and staking with SEBA, those investors are now showing significant interest for accessing yields in DeFi protocols. Due to various regulatory restrictions in their jurisdictions, SEBA’s institutional clientele has not been able deploy liquidities at large scale in Aave until now. The launch of Aave Arc with its permissioned layer represents a great opportunity for them to access DeFi yields while remaining compliant with their regulatory obligations. At SEBA, we believe that this will directly benefit the Aave community with institutional liquidities accelerating growth in TVL and in protocol revenues. 

The Aave Governance will review and approve Whitelisters that will conduct the requisite level of due diligence on Aave Arc participants. As a Swiss digital asset bank, we believe that SEBA is ideally positioned to provide those investors with the flexible and fully regulated platform that they need to bridge new liquidities in Aave Arc.

## About SEBA Bank
Founded in April 2018 and headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, SEBA Bank is a pioneer in the banking industry with the mission to build a regulated and progressive technological bridge between the traditional and the crypto worlds. With a FINMA banking and securities dealer license, SEBA Bank closes an important gap between the new digital economy and traditional banking. SEBA Bank enables professional individuals and companies as well as institutional clients to invest, custody, trade, stake, lend and borrow digital and traditional assets, all in one place. 

What SEBA brings to the Aave Arc community:

*	A fully regulated digital assets bank that embraces innovation
*	With a large institutional client base in demand for exploring new opportunities in DeFi
*	And with a banking-grade platform to securely bridge liquidities in Aave ARC

Avalanche: Signal for deployment

Summary

The Avalanche Foundation asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into Avalanche.

Proposer

The Avalanche Foundation is dedicated to supporting the Avalanche ecosystem and related technologies. The Foundation is part of a larger Avalanche ecosystem and working with other organizations to support the significant development of Avalanche-related technologies.

Avalanche is one of the fastest smart contracts platforms in the blockchain industry, as measured by time-to-finality, and has the most validators securing its activity of any proof-of-stake protocol. Avalanche’s C-Chain is an instance of the EVM running with Avalanche’s consensus.

Rationale

Current status of the Avalanche C-Chain: The Avalanche network is secured by over 1,000 validators and is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of Avalanche consensus. While maintaining this level of decentralization, the network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 1-2 seconds, making the network’s C-Chain an incredible playground for DeFi and other EVM applications. The ecosystem already has a slew of native projects offering exchange, lending, and aggregation services, over $1.5bn bridged from Ethereum, over $2.2bn in TVL, and protocols such as SushiSwap and Curve deployed or in the process of deploying.

Why it is good for the Aave ecosystem: The Avalanche blockchain is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, and near-instant finality. Through the Avalanche Rush program, the Avalanche foundation has allocated up to $20M AVAX for users of the Aave protocol over a three-month period to earn AVAX rewards while using Aave on Avalanche for the first phase of the program. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established Avalanche community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on established chains like Avalanche will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.

Why signaling is necessary? Consistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, he Avalanche Foundation believes that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on – and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. The Avalanche Rush announcement received a lot of interest from both the Aave and Avalanche communities. Deploying the Aave protocol on Avalanche will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.

Next Steps

Creation of Snapshot vote for the Aave community to signal YES/NO for deployment on Avalanche.

660,1491,1491,1491,2022-08-05 22:42:19+00:00,aave,"Current parameters:

Supply cap: 10M sUSD → 20m sUSD (proposed increase of supply cap)

Normal mode:

LTV: 60%

Liquidation threshold: 75%

Liquidation penalty: 5%

E-mode:

Assets: Stablecoins

Max LTV: 97%

Proposal: Increase of supply cap by 100% to 20m sUSD

The current sUSD supply cap on v3 is 10m sUSD and has been reached shortly after the launch of AAVE and Optimisms liquidity mining program on AAVE V3.

The proposal’s goal is to suggest an increase of 100% to 20m sUSD supply cap via the fast-track process as outlined here

Reasons for increase:

sUSD Dex Liquidity: Despite market conditions, sUSD DEX liquidity vastly increased across Optimism on Curve, Uniswap, Velodrome, and others. This can facilitate healthy liquidations if ever necessary.

sUSD’s Healthy Peg: Throughout the entire time sUSD has been an asset on AAVE, it has held peg and has not decreased within 1% of the expected peg of $1. This is due to increased sUSD Dex liquidity, and constant arbitrage of the peg by market makers.

Optimism Liquidity Mining: Due to the ongoing OP liquidity mining program on AAVE V3, the sUSD supply cap has been hit very quickly. To ensure that more users are able to supply/borrow on AAVE, it is important to increase this supply cap to ensure that there is ample amounts of sUSD available on AAVE.

671,1525,1525,1525,2024-04-18 21:49:35+00:00,apecoin,"##### ABSTRACT
Liquidation Loans (ZLLs). ZLLs are a novel DeFi primitive that allow (i) borrowers to borrow without liquidation risk and (ii) lenders to lend in underdeveloped credit markets with higher yield potential.

For DAOs, ZLLs are a powerful new tool to increase the utility of their native token and to enable them to use their reserves in a more productive and strategic way.

We propose the creation of a lending market for $APE, utilizing MYSO’s v2 protocol. This initiative can offer community members access to non-liquidatable loans, thereby enhancing the utility of the $APE token. If there is confidence in the continuous growth of $APE and a desire to offer more incentives to $APE token holders, establishing a non-liquidatable lending market is an effective way to achieve this objective.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
By using above described convertible Zero-Liquidation Loan product, it is possible to::
* Create credit markets for the $APE token without lengthy governance processes, oracle integrations, etc.
* Lend treasury reserves in a more strategic way that creates value for the overall community.
* Provide a unique borrowing experience to the ApeCoin’s community, without liquidation risk.
* Reduce selling pressure for the $APE token and incentivize long-term holding.
* Fully customize and control the loans one underwrites.
* Signal high conviction on the $APE token and participate in a possible synthetic buyback strategy.

SPECIFICATIONS
Using MYSO, it’s possible to offer fully customizable loan options to $APE token holders by simply setting up a lending vault and specifying the loan terms desired for lending.

For example, the grant recipient (i.e. Governance Working Group [GWG], see below) could set up a vault to lend out USDC (or any other token) and accept its native $APE token as collateral. The GWG can create multiple loan offers concurrently and define at which LTVs, tenors, and interest rates they’d feel comfortable lending. Updating/deleting these loan offers is also possible in a matter of minutes.

From a financial risk-reward perspective, the lender bears default risk that a loan may become undercollateralized and not be repaid. This resembles a deep in-the-money covered call strategy with a low delta. It’s worthwhile to mention that the risk premium is set by the GwG and can be hedged outside and independently of MYSO, if needed.

MYSO’s protocol fee starts at 0.1% and scales linearly to +0.4% for a loan with a duration of 1 year. To illustrate, the protocol fee for a loan with a 90 day tenor would therefore be at 0.2% of the collateral amount. Worthwhile to highlight that MYSO’s protocol fee is currently set at 0.00%.

MYSO v1 was deployed on Ethereum in January 2023. MYSO v2 was deployed on Mantle end of August 2023, on Ethereum end of September 2023 and on Arbitrum mid of October 2023. As of today, MYSO has a $1.25m TVL.

Other organizations that have successfully implemented MYSO’s lending protocol include:
* Olympus DAO ($500k pilot project for a gOHM/DAI lending market)
* Mantle (created a lending market for $MNT), Rocketpool (we launched the first RPL/rETH credit market for their community)
* Pendle (seeded a lending market for PT-sDAI Token), IndexCoop (to seed a lending market dsETH)


##### OVERALL COST 
$750,000 USD

In order to enable meaningful borrowing capacity, MYSO would recommend seeding $750k. It’s important to note that the GWG retains full control over their lender vault, as well as the credit markets and loans they underwrite. The GWG also has the flexibility to withdraw their funds at any time, excluding the portion currently being lent out, or add more funds to their lender vault if they wish to do so.

The Bored Ape Gazette is asking the ApeCoin DAO to fund the Bored Ape Gazette for another year to further amplify the DAO and Yugaverse, and enable the Gazette to add weekly Twitter spaces and daily short form animated video content to its output!

  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/2/2e53834df1adf8ccac5c8dbe82f06db0c35d659b_2_1380x784.jpeg)

Since June 1, 2021, the Bored Ape Gazette has been a part of the Yugaverse, providing daily coverage from the swamp and giving the community a go-to news source across the growing Yuga ecosystem. Over the last year, we have seen the community grow larger with several projects contributing to the Yugaverse such as Applied Primate, Mutant Cartel, and Mocaverse, among others. The Gazette is committed to continuing to build a trusted source of information for this ecosystem for years to come and would love for the paper to be powered by ApeCoin for another year!

  ![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/79a856ec594bb227ca43ac66d74cbdb5e33638b6.webp)

Thanks to the ApeCoin DAO’s support of AIP-70 last year, The Bored Ape Gazette was able to expand daily news coverage from 1.5 stories published per day to an average of 4 stories published per day and grow its Twitter audience from 10,000 Followers to nearly 30,000 followers. Today the Gazette averages over 500,000 monthly impressions on Twitter! Along with increased exposure on Twitter, the Gazette has also seen its website viewership go from a few thousand views a month to an average monthly viewership of 13,000! To date, the Gazette has published over 2,200 news articles, 52 weekly newsletter recaps, covered IRL events, live tweeted from important DAO meetings, and reported on important Twitter Space every week! In addition, with funds from last year’s approved AIP-70, the Gazette hired a website designer who has made the website more user-friendly, added a cryptocurrency ticker, an ApeCoin price chart page, and a new community calendar to reflect current and future events and Twitter Spaces!

With the funds requested in this proposal, the Gazette will continue to produce 3-5 Yugaverse/ ApeCoin stories per day, continue its two bi-weekly newsletters (Keeping Tabs On The Lab And The ApeCoin DAO-N Low), add daily animated news segments that will be shared across Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, start a Twitter Space series where the paper will interview builders, and add more amazing features to its website such as a language plug in, Yugaverse timeline, an “on this day in Bored history” section, additional ApeCoin metrics and numbers such as staking analytics, a new email blast campaign that will send subscribers a quick rundown on the swamp, the addition of dark mode, among other things!

With your continued support, the future of the Bored Ape Gazette will be very $Ape-ish and everyone inside and outside the Yugaverse will see a lot more $Ape content!

Here’s how much Ape and Yuga Labs content the Gazette will be putting out with this expansion every month!

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

The Bored Ape Gazette currently produces an average of four written articles per day, providing both those within and outside the Yugaverse with a go-to news source for information on all things $Ape! This AIP will empower the Gazette to maintain this level of written output while also enabling the addition of daily short-form video news content that will be shared on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. This new video content will reach new audiences who may not have the time to read the Gazette or be familiar with the ecosystem, giving them a chance to learn about all things $Ape and Yuga. This, in turn, will lead to increased exposure for the DAO, expand $Ape’s reach, and make the community better informed!

#### OVERALL COST

**Total: $150,000 USD worth of $Ape:**

* Cost Breakdown

**Content Creation For The Year: $120,000 USD. The Gazette will produce at least 1460 articles, 365 animated videos, 48 Twitter Spaces, 26 Keeping Tabs on The Lab Newsletters, and 26 ApeCoin DAO-N Low Newsletters, in the next year. That breaks down to $63.93 per article/video/ newsletter cost basis.

This proposal aims to establish a dominant presence for ApeCoin and ApeCoin DAO at the Non Fungible Conference (NFC) in Portugal, scheduled for May 28-29th, along with the wrap-up event on May 30th.

Planning involves securing a 20m² furnished networking lounge situated in a premium area of the conference. This lounge will include an interactive play-zone featuring stand-up arcade games designed to capture conference-attendee interest and generate opportunities to segue into ApeChain talks. The booth will also feature a large digital monitor playing ApeCoin-focused content, and a branded wall.

The conference’s primary WiFi network accessible for guests and other sponsors will be named ApeCoin. Attendee wristbands and staff t-shirts will display ApeCoin branding, and ApeCoin will be featured on various banners and screens during [Agoria’s](https://www.instagram.com/agoria/) final set of the opening night party, held at the event venue.

Two on-stage panels are being organized each with up to four speakers and a moderator. One discussion will focus on ApeChain, prioritizing members of the Special Council, Horizen Labs, and Layer Zero, while the other will cover ApeCoin DAO Working Groups.

ApeCoin will be announced as co-organizers alongside The Sandbox for the May 30th boat and beach wrap-up parties. The beach event will also serve as a pre-party for the [Moga Music Festival](https://www.instagram.com/mogafestival/) expected to draw between 10-12,000 jet-setters.

We will receive forty general access event tickets, access for forty general access allowlist spots, forty special-access boat tickets, and entry for up to forty people in the special-access area of the wrap-up event. Tickets will be distributed to community members in-person, and we will incentivize new Discourse signups with small amounts of APE.

The proposal also seeks approval to use the ApeCoin logo, and Powered by ApeCoin trademarks to be used for conference and wrap-up event marketing and physical conference-related branding. Provisions for promotional items include, but are not limited to, t-shirts, stickers, and educational materials have also been made. Any inventory produced under this allowance will be exclusive to conference attendees, on-stage panelists, and booth operators [not for sale].

Other conference features include a gaming startup competition with panelists Sebastien Borget (CEO Sandbox) and Robby Young (CEO Animoca Brands) helping judge, an AI Film and Fashion Festival, and a first-of-its-kind “Memecon” presented by OSF Rekt.

NFC speakers include Claire Silver, Punk6529, Deekay Motion, and John Knopf.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Participating in the NFC Conference offers ApeCoin, ApeChain, and the DAOs Working Group a prime opportunity for increased brand awareness and media exposure with over 200 Web3 speakers expected to attend.

Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of this plan compared to other events allows us to establish ApeCoin and ApeCoin DAO as one of the two dominant brand’s at the conference, alongside The Sandbox. Furthermore, Lisbon is known for its affordability in Western Europe, which helps business operations and travel.

Securing a 20m² area in a premium location with games and seating will enhance ApeCoin’s credibility, providing real-world exposure as a leading brand in the space. The conference also offers valuable networking and onboarding opportunities for ApeChain, serving as a platform for education regarding opportunities provided by the DAO.

##### OVERALL COST 
The proposal is requesting $155,000.00 USD denominated in APE with the full amount of funding required for conference and wrap-up sponsorship being provided in APE to the event.

If platinum-level sponsorships are unavailable when funding is provided, we will secure a gold-level booth in its place. Any difference in funding will either be not accepted or returned to the APE Foundation.

This proposal aims to request an increase in liquidity managed by our Liquidity Manager (Skynet Trading) in order to support the XVS/BNB trading pair on Binance. Specifically, we seek to allocate an additional $500,000 in XVS and $500,000 in BNB to ensure robust liquidity on the XVS/BNB Pair which is at risk of being delisted. This effort is crucial to maintain the listing of the BNB/XVS pair on Binance and to enhance trading efficiency and the market presence of Venus Protocol.

Objective

The primary objective is to secure and enhance liquidity for the XVS/BNB pair on Binance, Venus’s principal CEX partner. By increasing the liquidity, we aim to:

- Ensure Continuity: Prevent the delisting of the XVS/BNB pair on Binance.
- Enhance Trading Efficiency: Reduce slippage and improve the trading experience for users.
- Boost Market Confidence: Strengthen investor confidence in the stability and liquidity of XVS.
- Increase Visibility: Elevate Venus Protocol’s profile in the DeFi ecosystem.

Liquidity Strategy and Budget Allocation

The proposed liquidity allocation is as follows:

Binance: $500,000 in XVS and $500,000 in BNB

This allocation will support balanced liquidity and enable efficient trading and arbitrage opportunities on Binance, thus enhancing the overall market presence and stability of the XVS/BNB pair.

Governance and Control

To ensure the Venus community retains full control over the deployed assets, the following governance measures will be in place, as previously outlined in our forum, Snapshot, and VIP proposals:

Community Oversight

Liquidity will remain accessible by the Venus Treasury and can be withdrawn if a governance proposal requesting its return is submitted and approved.

Conclusion

This proposal seeks the approval of the Venus community to allocate an additional $500,000 in XVS and $500,000 in BNB to the XVS/BNB pair on Binance. By enhancing liquidity, we aim to ensure the pair remains listed, improve trading efficiency and boost investor confidence in Venus Protocol.

785,1852,1852,1852,2023-08-29 14:04:04+00:00,venus,"This vote is being submitted by the Venus Community on behalf of Polygon Labs in response to their proposal submitted to the Venus Community Forum on August 1st 2023. 

Introduction

The community of Venus Protocol has made significant strides since their inception in 2020, successfully lowering the entry barrier for millions of users worldwide and positioning themselves as one of the most widely utilized decentralized applications in web3.

To continue pushing the envelope of DeFi’s potential, we propose that the Venus Money Mark Protocol be deployed on Polygon zkEVM. This deployment will provide a synergy between Venus Protocol and Polygon zkEVM, a scalable Layer 2 protocol, potentially enhancing the user experience and risk management features for Venus’ growing community.

Additionally, given the close relationship between PancakeSwap and Venus, we’re excited to continue supporting one of the largest pairs of partners in DeFi.

Rationale

We believe this is the right moment for Venus to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons:

Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility.
Polygon zkEVM is an Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.

The Polygon ecosystem is aligned with Ethereum and its values.
LayerZero has deployed their endpoint on Polygon zkEVM, in line with the Omnichain Money Market 5 post for cross-chain expansion on Venus.
The migration to Polygon zkEVM would not only capitalize on the compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts but also benefit from the scalability features offered by Polygon’s zkEVM.

Polygon zkEVM, an open-source ZK-Rollup, delivers a hassle-free user experience withEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It flawlessly integrates with pre-existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets. Leveraging the strength of ZK proofs, Polygon zkEVM significantly reduces transaction expenses and substantially boosts transaction speed, while also adopting Ethereum’s robust security. The Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta was successfully launched on March 27, 2023.

Benefits

*Listing assets on Polygon zkEVM within Venus isolated pools to further enhance protocol and asset use-cases.

*Multi-chain expansion into the Polygon ecosystem introduces the successful Venus protocol to a completely new set of Ethereum-adjacent builders.

*Enhanced User Experience: Leveraging the Polygon zkEVM can minimize user and developer friction and provide a smoother, more seamless experience.

*Risk Management: Venus’s isolated pools feature and Polygon zkEVM’s verifiable zero-knowledge proofs can further bolster the protocol’s security and risk management capabilities.

Incentives

To help bootstrap Venus’ growth on Polygon zkEVM, we will provide a $100,000 MATIC grant, with the aim of user acquisition.

Additionally, we will provide additional incentives for Venus’ continued growth on Polygon zkEVM:

$50k at $10m TVL
$50k at $25m TVL

Finally, the core DeFi BD team at Polygon Labs will work closely with the Venus team to:

*Co-Market Venus’ launch on Polygon zkEVM

*Connect Venus to the large ecosystem of Polygon-based builders who are eager to work with the money market

*Work closely with Venus on any questions around launch across developer, business development, and project support.

Proposal:
Deploy Venus Protocol on Polygon zkEVM:
Deployment on Polygon zkEVM, Venus will also get the opportunity to get the added advantages of the Polygon Ecosystem, ranging from not only business development support of Polygon Labs, but also community expansion, marketing support, chance to participate in an ecosystem with more than 50000 dAPPs, and support from the best product and solutions engineering team in crypto industry.

Legal

The legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as “Polygon Labs”.

Conflict of Interest Declaration

There are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Venus's legal entities, including Venus, Venus tokens, nor investments of Venus.

Risk Profile

Deploying on Polygon zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer 2 protocol, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereum’s core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens.

A proposal was published on the Community Forum to add support for both stETH and wstETH but due to stETH being a rebasing token, that could increase the complexity and it would require a deep analysis to check implications on liquidations, rewards, etc and further delay deployment. 

For this reason, we are proposing to add support for Lido’s wstETH market only at this time on ETH mainnet.

Rationale

wstETH is a well-established and widely recognized token in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH. It’s more composable with DeFi protocols.

Motivations

By integrating wstETH into its markets, Venus Protocol would allow its users to earn lending APY on their staked ETH holdings, loop yield vs ETH and borrow other assets like stables for their daily operations. Furthermore, supporting these tokens would also enhance Venus Protocol’s overall liquidity and trading volume.

Conclusion

Adding support for wstETH tokens on Venus Protocol would provide users with access to a wider range of investment opportunities, enable them to earn lending APYs on top of staking rewards on Ethereum, and enhance the liquidity and trading volume on the platform.",bearish,11.97,2024-01-11 14:33:48+00:00,11.2,11.2,2024-01-12 00:00:00+00:00,6.432748538011699,11.655,-0.0263157894736843,0.9027189612388612,True," The text discusses a proposal to add support for wstETH, a wrapped version of stETH, in Venus Protocol's markets, instead of both stETH and wstETH due to the complexity of handling stETH as it is a rebasing token. This decision is based on wstETH's established status in the DeFi ecosystem and its compatibility with other DeFi protocols. Integrating wstETH would allow Venus Protocol users to earn lending APY on their staked ETH holdings, increase liquidity, and trading volume. In summary, the addition of wstETH is expected to provide a wider range of investment opportunities and enhance the platform's overall performance.",bearish

This proposal seeks to introduce ezETH as a supported asset on Venus Protocol on Ethereum Mainnet and BNB. It aims to leverage the innovative features of this reward bearing liquid restaking token to enhance the lending and borrowing ecosystem, provide further diversified collateral options, and foster greater liquidity and user engagement within the Venus Protocol.

Rationale

Renzo is a Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer. It is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs) and offering a higher yield than ETH staking.

$ezETH is the liquid restaking token representing a user’s restaked position at Renzo. Users can deposit native ETH or LSTs and receive $ezETH.

Our strategy has focused on distribution and abstraction broadly speaking. Our north star is abstracting away what is otherwise a complex, nuanced, and intensive process of restaking and delegating with operators, making it as easy as possible to restake.

$ezETH currently has $4b+ in TVL and 125+ integrations live across 8 supported networks where we’ve brought significant value, volume, and users to a variety of participating DeFi ecosystems. We believe a listing on Venus for both networks could be one of our more important integrations thus far, and will commit to providing supplemental incentive multipliers and growth activities to funnel users to the platform where they can find additional utility for their $ezETH holdings.

Website: https://www.renzoprotocol.com/ 

Conclusion

With the demand for LRTs as an asset class in the current DeFi landscape along with Renzo’s pioneering focus on integrations, distribution, and chain expansion, pursuing a listing for $ezETH on Venus for both networks is a no brainer and top priority for the protocol’s growth strategy. We take great care to foster and cultivate relationships with our partners and their communities. We view this as a significant long term collaboration and we expect Venus to be one of Renzo’s top integration partners on both networks moving forward.",bearish,6.48,2024-06-21 17:39:29+00:00,6.06,6.06,2024-06-23 00:00:00+00:00,6.48148148148149,6.220000000000001,-0.0401234567901234,0.8798249959945679,True," The text presents a proposal for listing ezETH, a liquid restaking token, on the Venus Protocol.

Given PancakeSwap’s positive market growth across our v3 deployments as well to keep our Farms’ APR competitive against other liquidity venues, this proposal aims to decrease CAKE emission to Farms across all chains.

The previous round of [**Adjustments to Farm Rewards**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0xc3c48f2e4de3916bb5ad4d54681658b4a3940525dd1bf23eadc82aa3f3fa8ae0) increased the overall CAKE burn by approximately **1,150 CAKE per day** with minimal impact to trading volumes. This proposal aims to decrease emissions and increase the overall CAKE burn by approximately **4,000 CAKE per day**.

As time passes, this optimization will help to 1) improve the overall efficiency and spend of CAKE across Farms and 2) continue to make CAKE deflationary.

#### Adjustment Details

With the above in mind, we are proposing to apply the following adjustments:
1. Reduce Farm emissions by 12.5% across all 8 chains (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Aptos, zkSync, Base, Arbitrum, Linea, and Polygon zkEVM)
2. BNB Chain’s core Farms will have their CAKE emissions reduced by 17.5% instead (including: BNB-USDT, BNB-BUSD, BUSD-USDT, USDC-USDT, USDC-BUSD, CAKE-BNB, CAKE-USDT, BTC-BUSD, BTC-USDT, ETH-USDT, BTC-BNB, ETH-BNB, and BTC-ETH)
3. Direct all the reduced CAKE emissions to increase our weekly burn

PancakeSwap is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), providing users with a wide range of DeFi services and trading options. PancakeSwap is community-driven and offers a highly efficient and secure platform for DeFi transactions. As part of our ongoing development, we seek to enable users to bridge tokens between PancakeSwap and Zora Network.

-Proposal-

Deploy the following pools and pathways for token bridging between PancakeSwap and Zora Network:
-BNB: PancakeSwap, Binance Smart Chain, Zora Network
-USDT: PancakeSwap, Binance Smart Chain, Zora Network
-CAKE: PancakeSwap, Binance Smart Chain, Zora Network

-User Incentives and Application Support-

Discussions regarding user incentives and application support will take place between the PancakeSwap Governance and the Zora Network Integration Team. Details will be documented and approved through a governance proposal.

-Liquidity incentives may be provided by PancakeSwap in the form of CAKE rewards, the exact amount to be determined based on community consensus and the Zora Network Integration Team's recommendations.

-Technical Integration and Maintenance-

PancakeSwap will ensure the technical integration of Zora Network's token bridging solution. The integration will be reviewed and maintained regularly to ensure the seamless operation of the bridging services.

1013,2670,2670,2670,2023-06-09 07:55:55+00:00,pankcakeswap,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

Firstly, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to the Trading Allocation (and therefore farms) – the per block allocation to the Trading Allocation will remain at [**1.93 CAKE/block**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics).

Importantly, the purpose of this proposal is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. 

By boosting APRs for higher-performing farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to adjust CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below. Rewards will be redistributed from farms with reduced multipliers to farms with increased multipliers, along with all other existing farms. This will give us increased capacity to establish Syrup Pool/Farm arrangements with more partner projects.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their relative performance on metrics such as their farm multiplier, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, etc.

1149,3103,3103,3103,2023-03-02 13:56:00+00:00,pankcakeswap,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Multipliers

This proposal will boost APRs for most of our popular pairs across PancakeSwap, and is part of our preparation for our v3 deployment.

Similar to previous proposals, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to the Trading Allocation – the per block allocation to the Trading Allocation will be unchanged at [**~3.11 CAKE/block**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics) as of proposal posting.

By redistributing farm rewards from the farms mentioned below, APRs for all other performing farms will be boosted, **enabling a more positive environment for increased trading**. 
 
This ultimately leads to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns, optimizing how the platform utilizes the Trading Allocation.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and optimal manner.**

#### Refresher

We recently streamlined our tokenomics – structuring our emissions by function, rather than product –, and Farm Rewards are part of the Trading Allocation now. Read more [**here**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x57e2865781344eb395f37e38a2c78a92ea9efc3413ef0d33438b2e331015e803).

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,

- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier was removed for the under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to redistribute CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below:

**Farm with Increased Multipliers**

| LP          | Current Weight | New Weight | Change |
|:--------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:------:|

| ETH-BNB   | 19 | 25  | +6   |

**Farm with Reduced Multipliers**

1. Increase rewards for farmers
2. Increase the utility of staked CAKE
3. Increase the protocol revenue 
4. Reduce CAKE emissions
5. Get closer to ultrasound money

Every few weeks we vote to change the rewards for each farm, reducing some and increaing others.  This method should be scraped and replaced with a ""ve"" type voting gauge. 

Staked CAKE holders could then vote on how the CAKE rewards should be split between the farms. 
If a farm get 5% of the vote then they get 5% of the CAKE rewards. 

Once a vote deadline has been hit, them reward amounts are locked in for 2 weeks and then votes are recounted every 2 weeks. 

On top of the Gauge voting system we build a UI for bribes, where farmers and 3rd party protocols can offer a payment to staked CAKE holders in exchange for their votes. 

As the bribe UI builds up and the bribes start coming in, we can start reducing the CAKE emissions being paid to the staked CAKE holders.  Replacing CAKE emissions with income from other protocols. 
The reduction of emissions to the staked CAKE pool should be at a slow and steady rate of 1 CAKE per block per month until the rewards are 0 CAKE emissions. 

After the first reduction in emissions to the staked CAKE pool the protocol will redirect 5% of the trading fees (from the 0.01% and 0.05% farms) to rewarding the staked CAKE pool.  

To kickstart the system the rewards to farmers should be increased by 0.25 CAKE per block per month over a 6 month time frame, increasing the emissions by 1.5 CAKE per block.  Once the ecosystem is up and running we can look at reducing these emissions. 



The expected outcome.

1. Emissions reduced by 0.75 CAKE per block a month with a total reduction of 5.15 CAKE per block after 7 months. a 55% reduction in emissions. 
2. Staked CAKE holders rewards switch from emissions to bribes + trading fees, avoiding a massive overnight cut in rewards. 
3. Farmers see an steady increase in the overall rewards allocated to farming. 
4. 3rd party protocols have the option to buy voting power with bribes, which should increase the liquidity in their farms. 
5. 3rd party protocols now have a reason to buy and hold staked CAKE so they can vote for their own liquidity pools. 
6.

However, though the current appearance of pancakeswap is already outstanding, i would like to propose an additional feature to the pools for the convenience of investors and better experience with pancakeswap. Following is my proposal,

In the pools, i would like to propose to show 2 kinds of APY:

1. First is the APY with regards to the amount of CAKE staked (since i cannot find a good explanation of the exact calculation in the docs, i assume that this is the current method of calculating APY that is shown in the app).

2. Second is the APY with regards to the amount of the initial calculated USD staked (this helps the stakers to see how much their money, in USD, really grow). For example, if i staked $100 in cake and APY of 10% in cake, and the price of cake down by 5% the next day, i can still get an APY of about 4.5% according to my initial USD.

I hope that the community support this idea.

Technology advancement

new chain technology could would allow the CAKE DEX to do more, including cross chain etc. 

Fees go back to CAKE 

obvious advantages for the CAKE faithful bakers. 

DEX is the future 

this means more Bakers in CAKE more load on the already stressed BSC, it seems inevitable that either the BSC will need to evolve or CAKE needs to evolve a new chain perhaps a new common chain is the answer? however CAKE transactions should generate CAKE fees for CAKE bakers. 

Lower fees

CAKE chain would have the ability to generate fees for CAKE bakers however these fees should be lower than the present BSC chain based in current metrics this is because of both advancement in Bunny technology & the current market price ratio.

1307,3617,3617,3617,2022-01-18 10:07:06+00:00,pankcakeswap,"I have been in Cake since the first week it was launched. I invested when few people knew about it and considered it a joke. Now Pancake swap is the #1 decentralized exchange based on users and volume. The Pancake swap team deserves a huge amount of praise for their efforts for how they have evolved the platform. But its time to evolve again.

Pancake swap has done an incredible job of creating a deflationary token system. It has redefined ICOs and made them safe for everyone. Just a few years ago ICOs were riddled with scams as you had to send your crypto blindly to an address hoping you would get something back. Now all you have to do is hold the Cake token. Major projects like Coin 98, Trust Wallet, Axie Infinity and hundreds more were given to Cake holders just for holding the token. Now EVERY other Dex is trying to copy this model. But the projects they give pale in comparison to what Pancake provides. 

In an effort to reduce Cake inflation they have had to remove rewards for certain LPs. This caused people to remove their liquidity. It's important to note that Pancake did not remove these pools as some would suggest, they just removed the CAKE rewards for them. But there is a reward structure you receive for providing LP, and many LPs pay great rewards in the provided tokens. Few understand this. Instead they say ""Pancake removed our pool"" There are some pools that pay over 100% in fees with no Cake rewards (search for them). 


That said, the FUD of ""Cake removed our pool"" has resulted in less liquidity, and as a result higher fees when swapping many tokens. It's not about the fee that Pancake charges, that's still one of the lowest in the industry, rather its the PRICE IMPACT. If there isn't enough liquidity you can pay over 5% in some cases. But becuase the pool isn't incentivized enough people aren't providing liquidity to reduce the price impact.  You can't have an efficient exchange without people providing liquidity. This is a problem for ALL decentralized exchanges. Not just Pancake Swap.

SOLUTION

1. Stop Cake emissions. 

The Cake reward structure was devised at a time when no one knew how big DEFI would become. Cake has grown bigger than anyone could have imagined. The old Cake reward structure no longer works for the future. There is however a fantastic deflationary mechanism in place. Cake would continued to be burned by these mechanisms. Cake would also still be used in IFOs and governance and voting. You also MUST own a minimum amount of Cake just for using the platform. There are too many people using the platform that dont own Cake. 

2. Create a New Reward Token.

This token will be used to incentivize LPs longterm. Rewards would never be removed from the LPs. The only way you would receive this token is by having Cake. The reward token could be incentivized in other ways. The team knows how to create deflationary models to keep the price stable. 

3. Replace many of the BNB LPs with Cake. 

BNB has many deflationary mechanisms in place and no one can use BSC without BNB. But again we're giving away too much Cake to non Cake holders. 

4. Increase the fees to providers. 

0.17% to providers is not enough. This needs to be at least 0.3 or higher. This means the total fee needs to be at least 0.43% to continue to burn Cake at the same rate. Although with NO inflation, we dont need to burn Cake at the same rate. If this seems high to you...you're wrong. With stock brokerages it is typical to pay over 1% in fees for transactions. Forex the lowest fee you pay on the most liquid pairs is 1.2%
Even Coinbase charges almost 2% on exchanges. They do this by manipulating their exchange price vs the real price. 

In reality in most cases you are paying more than 0.43% because of the price impact. If your price impact is 0.3% that means your TOTAL fee is 0.6% 0.3% is a VERY LOW price impact but thats still higher than it should be. If we all provide enough liquidity then we can get the price impact on ALL pairs to less than 0.1%

The exchange then becomes more efficient. Which is what we all want.",bearish,10.9,2022-01-18 10:07:06+00:00,10.25,10.25,2022-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,5.96330275229358,10.42,-0.0440366972477064,0.9440548419952391,True," The text expresses high praise for Pancake Swap, a decentralized exchange, noting its success and innovative deflationary token system.

Advantages: 

1: The platform will be more dynamic and great ideas can be implentende when they are needed. 

2: Our community will become more active and thuse attracting more participation, AKA growth. 

3: With a flexible DAO we can handle market changes basically in the moment!

1: The team will be overloaded, at least in the short term. But this can be balanced out with the growth that will follow. More growth = the team can easily expand.

For the ones who doesn't know what's Binance Launchpad, it's a Binance platform designed for launching & farming new tokens.

Recently, the Mobox team allocated 3 million of their native tokens to be farmed by Binance users for a small period of time. Among this movement, Binance listed their token in several pairs. As consequence from the launchpad offering and the listing, MBOX gained a 150% in less than 4 hours.

PancakeSwap team are great friends with Binance, but there has never been such an event in their launchpad platform, yet.

**The proposal:**

**Allocate 800,000 CAKE tokens** *(~16 M $USD)* substracted from the weekly burn to be launched on Binance Launchpad.

This will allow all Binance's users to farm CAKE tokens with BNB, BUSD and CAKE. It can't be a better marketing campaign than appear in the first page of Binance, seen by millions of users, to increase the CAKE adoption and keep building its real value.

# Current Situation:
* The Pool's APY for CAKE is continuously going down.
* We now have **very high supply of CAKE in Pool**.
* The best return you can get on your cake is from Pool.
* There are **only 3 farms that use CAKE** token.

# Now, the Idea is:
To use CAKE instead of BNB in farms (Current of upcoming Farm XXX-BNB can be replaced with XXX-CAKE).

* This **will not change CAKE emission** at all.

https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/144

## Background
We have been researching & developing TWAMMs built on top of Balancer as a custom pool. Balancer grants DAO has been extremely supportive of our endeavor and we're excited to launch next month. You can learn more about the project here: 
https://github.com/Cron-Finance/Cron-Finance

## Motivation

TWAMMs and Balancer pools in general are complicated to interact with in absence of a UX. We are building a dedicated relayer that abstracts the complexity from the end-user and provides safety in terms of slippage protection and error handling. 

We want to do this all from a smart contract thus maintaining the advantages of a fully on-chain protocol: *permissionless, composability, & decentralization*. Additionally, we don’t want our protocol to be restricted by hostile regulatory regimes that target Web UX.

## Interactions

Below are the two ways to interact with the core TWAMM contracts today via Gnosis Safe or Etherscan. Without a dedicated UX, the user would have to know how to set slippage, handle errors, etc themselves.

### Unsafe + complex: interact through Vault
A user would have to create `tuples` and be knowledgeable of Balancer’s Vault infrastructure. Furthermore, they would have to `abi.encode` data specific to TWAMM like **intervals, swap type**, etc. 

 
![cron1.png](ipfs://bafkreib2heo6avwev2fz7lreq73eoquxwlplamtpjmsvvay7pctolrjm4m)
    

### Safe + intuitive: relayer/periphery contract
Here the user would specify very simple inputs (similar to in a UX) in order to execute a long-term swap.

 
![cron2.png](ipfs://bafkreie76ezaoudccunczgtuv3hhjznnmknjblqei3q5hgyrnb7m57dxti)
    


## Development

We will create our Relayer, similar to Balancer Relayer ([https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/standalone-utils/contracts/relayer/BalancerRelayer.sol](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/standalone-utils/contracts/relayer/BalancerRelayer.sol)), but with added abstractions for the following functions:

- `function longTermSwap`
- `function shortTermSwap`
- `function partnerSwap`
- `function join`
- `function exit`
- `function withdraw`
- `function cancel`

 
![cron3.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidcqidhd6jreyh2bibonces3cfx3bhcckznhqjtws5l7n3dlyjm3u)
    


## Security

- The core contracts have been fully audited by SpearbitDAO: [https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/CronFinance-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/CronFinance-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf)
- The periphery contract will be audited by SpearbitDAO as well.
- Users of this relay will have to explicitly approve the relayer before using it.
- Relayer actions will be scoped to: `join, exit, swap`
- We will scope the relay to only interact with TWAMM pools recognized by our Factory contract:

## Tradeoffs

### Balancer
    
    ⛔️ Attack vectors: addressed in the security section
    ✅ Ease of use for a new pool type
    ✅ Expand Balancer pool interaction to fully on-chain
    ✅ Exploring & developing the Relayer ecosystem for other teams, integrators
   
### Cron
    
    ⛔️ Increase of attack surface
    ✅ Vastly improved on-chain UX
    ✅ Moat against copycats, vampire forks
    ✅ Simplified onboarding of different user personas: whales, protocols, 3rd party front-ends
    
### Users, integrators
    
    ⛔️ Additional gas costs of the periphery
    ✅ Interact directly without UX/3rd party
    ✅ Ease of use and integration    
    ✅ Safety and slippage checks are done by the periphery    
    ✅ Abstract TWAMM complexity
    

## Governance

We would like governance to approve this relayer so we can onboard users faster, improve user experience, and reduce the complexity to interact with TWAMMs.

### Relayer Information:
https://etherscan.io/address/0xE0Ca4DAc40d44D737f0d02B1F2B2D969731eCda9

Balancer’s architecture requires governance approval for `CronFi: Relayer` for these actions:

### Vault Actions:

1749,4762,4762,4762,2022-05-05 16:32:59+00:00,balancer,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-fund-the-integration-of-boosted-pools-in-the-1inch-aggregation-protocol/3069)

## Abstract

This proposal calls for funding the integration of [Balancer Boosted Pools](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/boosted-pools) into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol in accordance with the [proposal](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1ip-07-integrate-balancer-boosted-pools-in-the-1inch-aggregation-protocol/3096) put on the 1inch DAO forum.

## Motivation

Balancer Boosted Pools are a tremendous innovation in the AMM space. Many teams and protocols are eager to adapt the Boosted Pools and take advantage of their efficiency for their own unique use cases and needs. The bbaUSD pool currently sits at $350mm.

Boosted Pools have yet to be integrated by the aggregators and as such the liquidity in these pools is not being efficiently utilized by the market. This proposal aims to fund the integration of Boosted Pools in the 1inch aggregator.

Given that this is a new pool type and requires effort from 1inch Labs, BalancerDAO, through this proposal, would fund this integration via a payment of 20,000 BAL (or equivalent in stablecoins) to 1inch Labs.

### Specification

As outlined in the proposal on the [1inch Forum](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1ip-07-integrate-balancer-boosted-pools-in-the-1inch-aggregation-protocol/3096):

1. 1inch Labs shall integrate the Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API.
2. The integration shall be live on the Ethereum main-net no later than 3 weeks after this proposal passes the Phase-4 snapshot vote.
3. If both conditions 1 and 2 are met, Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will transfer 20k BAL or the equivalent in stablecoins (as determined by Balancer DAO) to 1inch Labs.

The integration of Boosted Pools requires support for linear pools math, order routing and support for BatchSwaps. 1inch’s support for BatchSwaps would generally benefit the Balancer protocol by decreasing the cost of multihop swaps even outside of Boosted Pools.

This grant is contingent on the same proposal passing through the 1inch DAO.

Upon satisfactory integration, 20,000 BAL shall be sent to 1inch Labs ETH address: 0x2DF104682A61241C79eBB3ce3b2C293578bF6A9D

As outlined on the adjacent proposal, satisfactory integration is defined as the 1inch Aggregation Protocol accurately forwarding trades through the bbaUSD and the bbfUSD pools, on Ethereum main-net, when those pools offer the optimal pricing for the end-user.

## Rationale

The vast majority of trade volume on the Balancer protocol is driven by DEX aggregators. Among the aggregators, 1inch drives a very significant portion of the volume. As such, adoption and integration of Boosted Pools by aggregators is imperative for the success of the Boosted Pools.

I encourage the DAO to ratify this grant and fund the integration of Boosted Pools in the 1inch aggregator.",bearish,13.51,2022-05-05 16:32:59+00:00,12.56,12.56,2022-05-07 00:00:00+00:00,7.03182827535158,13.3,-0.0155440414507771,0.8844544291496277,True," This text discusses a proposal to integrate Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol, with funding provided by the BalancerDAO.

Hi, Balancer community,

I’m Théo, core-contributor at mStable.

mStable is a Decentralised Stablecoin Ecosystem composed of a capital-efficient AMM and a high-yielding savings account product.
I am reaching out today to discuss a partnership opportunity arising from the upcoming launch of our Emission Controller.

## Context

mStable is about to release its version of the Gauge controller, inspired from Curve’s, which will dictate rewards distribution over the next 5 years (~35m MTA).

As we speak, two Balancer pools are receiving MTA rewards:

One on Mainet [MTA / WETH Balancer pool]
One on Polygon [MTA/WETH/WMATIC Balancer pool]
Balancer & mStable have been maintaining a long-standing relationship: mStable was one of the first user of Balancer in August 2020 and had the biggest pool at some point there.

## Opportunity

We thought it would be highly beneficial for Balancer to take on an MTA position and vote for those pools, thus directing higher rewards that will inevitably attract more liquidity to the pools.

This is an opportunity to go a step further with shared governance and treasury diversification while bringing significant extra TVL to Balancer. It is also a nice way to do a joint marketing campaign highlighting both protocols

## Specification

a) Swapped amounts and origination

-20k BAL against the equivalent USD value worth of MTA were agreed 
 upon for this swap
-MTA tokens would be sent from the mStable Treasury Asset 
 Management subDAO ( 
 0x67905d3e4fec0c85dce68195f66dc8eb32f59179 ) to the Balancer -Treasury DAO ( 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f )
-BAL tokens would be sent from the Balancer Treasury DAO ( 
 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f ) to the mStable 
 Treasury Asset Management subDAO ( 
 0x67905d3e4fec0c85dce68195f66dc8eb32f59179 )

b) Timeline and swap execution

This proposal will go to a Snapshot vote on the side of mStable on the 6th of December, and resolve on the 10th of December. Balancer voting will start at 7am EST Dec 6th, and resolve 7am EST Dec 10th so both protocols have the same voting window.

Swap execution: Tokens will be swapped on-chain if both votes are approved, and the 1 year holding time will begin at the time the tokens from the transfer enter the wallet of the corresponding DAO.

c) Pricing method and price feeds

It has been agreed to use a 30-days smooth average. The time window for the 30 days average would be from the 10th of November until the 10th of December 2021.

MTA Price feed: MTA/ USD (Chainlink) BAL Price feeds: BAL/USDT (Binance)",bearish,15.81,2021-12-05 23:30:54+00:00,14.35,14.35,2021-12-06 00:00:00+00:00,9.23466160657812,15.97,0.0101201771030992,0.8406834006309509,True," The text discusses a proposal for a partnership between Balancer and mStable, where mStable offers to swap 20k BAL tokens for an equivalent value in MTA tokens.

Good day Balancer governors 🙂

I would like to propose a Balancer deployment onto Mode Network. Mode is a new L2 in the Superchain that has been live for 8 weeks and has over 240m dollars of TVL on chain and growing rapidly. 165m is deployed into dApps which is a very productive ratio for an L2. Balancer live within Mode would allow for more efficient trading execution and liquidity provision for users within the ecosystem. We have a focus on yield bearing assets like ezETH and weETH and Balancer would be a great home for their liquidity as more and more users bridge over their assets. If the DAO chooses to deploy, Balancer will be a key pillar in our dApp ecosystem and we would love to have your unique protocol as part of the family on Mode.

**About Mode**

[DeFillama](https://defillama.com/chain/Mode)
[L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/mode)
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/modenetwork)
[Mode Docs](https://docs.mode.network/)

Mode is a DeFi focused L2 that is building out an ecosystem of quality dApps to create new onchain economies for users to engage with. We aim to be the yield hub of the Superchain. Mode is an optimistic roll up with the ability to have a modular approach to our technology stack. We are very quick to move onto new yield opportunities and will make sure Balancer is part of these campaigns as we grow together. Balancer provides a very efficient design for liquidity on some of our most important assets like liquid re-staking tokens. We are happy to support the bootstrapping period with liquidity and 2x Mode points to incentivize community engagement in providing liquidity.

**Goals**

* We propose Balancer deploy as soon as possible to be positioned as a key pillar within our ecosystem. 

* We will support your deployment with liquidity and incentives to support Balancer's deployment and growth as Mode grows. 

* We would also like to include Balancer as a core piece of technology in our accelerator to encourage developers to build innovative products on top of Balancers liquidity. 

* If deployed we will highlight Balancer on our ecosystem page so users can easily find the application.

* There are several dApps within our ecosystem that would like to integrate Balancer if you choose to deploy within our ecosystem and we would be happy to facilitate these integrations with haste.

**Conclusion**

Balancer is a key pillar in DeFi and has the opportunity to tap in to our rapidly growing ecosystem to continue its growth across L2s.

**Summary:**
> This is a proposal to enable Balancer Gauge for SYNO/wETH 80/20 pool on Arbitrum.
Synonym Finance launched in February of 2024, achieved a TVL in the protocol of $10M+ and achieved a liquidity of $1M+ in the governance token pool 80SYNO-20WETH on Balancer on Arbitrum. SYNO serves as a governance token for Synonym Finance. Much like many protocols in the DeFI space, providing liquidity on Balancer and locking it on the Synonym Dapp provides users with a boost towards emissions as well as share of fees. WIth the introduction of the Gauge, BAL/AURA emissions will now further fuel the incentive for liquidity provision, amplifying the pool’s attractiveness and increasing the size of the pool even further. 


**References/Useful links:**

Website: https://www.synonym.finance/
Documentation: Docs: https://synonym-finance.gitbook.io/synonym-finance/documentation/overview 
Github Page: https://github.com/SynonymFinance
Twitter: https://twitter.com/synonymfinance
Discord: https://discord.com/invite/synonymfinance


**Protocol Description:**

> Synonym Finance is a universal cross-chain money market built for busy DeFi Professionals. Users can lend, borrow and earn rewards across multiple chains without leaving our unified UI. Synonym is a truly cross-chain application powered by the Wormhole xChain technology stack and further enhanced by Circle CCTP. The goal of Synonym is to unify and take advantage of the liquidity fragmented across various chains. Synonym Finance launched on Arbitrum, Ethereum and Optimism Chains. 


**Motivation:**

> SYNO/wETH pool is highly important to Synonym as this pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity on Arbitrum. Additionally, users are incentivized to provide liquidity into this pool as they will be eligible for a boost towards $SYNO emissions as well as share of the revenue. This kicks off a flow where users get emissions - lock liquidity and get even more emissions. The proposed gauge will give the chance to incentivize even higher rewards for the pool, thus increasing the liquidity of SYNO token.
The current sustainable yield for providing liquidity to the pool is around 15%. We expect to significantly increase the APR with enabling Balancer Gauge, via Aura in future. After that, the pool would naturally grow and attract even further user base into the ecosystem. Additionally, we expect to facilitate even further incentivization with Aura or alternatively Hidden Hand, our partners through a connection via Redacted Finance.


**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Synonym Finance governance’s structure is provided [here](https://synonym-finance.gitbook.io/synonym-finance/documentation/governance).   

2. **Oracles:** Synonym Finance relies on Pyth Price Oracles.


3. **Audits:** Synonym Finance has been audited twice: by Runtime Verification and Ottersec. You can find audits [here](https://synonym-finance.gitbook.io/developer-docs/audits).

4. **Centralization vectors:** Due to our experience in the space, our governance is set in a decentralized manner and we are further looking to decentralize it even further. Forum - [here](https://forum.synonym.finance/overview). Due to the recent launch, the governance process is yet to be kicked off. The DAO is governed by the multisigs on Arbitrum and Ethereum. The smart contracts are verified, and any community member may propose changes or Improvements. There have already been proposals from the active members of the community. All contracts are available in the docs and are easily observed by members of the community.

5. **Market History:** Synonym Finance launched on 6th of February 2024. We have launched after a merger with New Order DAO and an additional raise of $1.5M from investors led by Borderless Capital. We have reached a TVL of $13M and now are expanding into new assets & chains. $SYNO has launched on the same date. Coingecko [link](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/synonym-finance).

6. **Value:** The SYNO/wETH pool would be the primary source of liquidity for SYNO governance token. In addition, the Synonym DAO sees a huge value of this gauge in growing the total liquidity locked in the pool to $10M+.

Across supporting the Balancer token has been a huge success. So much so that the Across LP is nearly maxed out. This proposal asks the Balancer treasury to deposit another 40,000 BAL tokens into the Across LP (same size as initial deposit). 

**Motivation**: 
Balancer has 80k tokens that are stuck on Multichain and not useable for bridging. BAL token is not enabled on any other of the main 3rd party bridges (not canonical) for a meaningful amount of routes. Balancer team is pushing for more cross chain uses of the token and Across is the dominant bridge in being able to provide this service.

Here is a graph of volume share between the canonical bridges (arbitrum, polygon, and base) and Across bridge over the last 100 days. You can see Across continues to gain share and it's currently 52% of the overall market vs canonical bridges!

**Summary**

Stader proposes adding a gauge for the Matic<>MaticX pool on Balancer. MaticX is a liquid token for Matic staking built by StaderLabs, a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider with ~770 mn $ in TVL. The incentivization of the Matic<>MaticX pool on Balancer will help:

1. Build deep liquidity would be a prerequisite to make staked Matic truly liquid in the Polygon Defi ecosystem and incentives would be an important mechanism to aid this
2. Establish Balancer as the prime DEX for Matic <> MaticX pool. Two reasons why this is important:
  1. $3 bn in assets locked in polygon staking currently that is set to be unlocked by liquid staking solutions like MaticX
  2. With its metastable pool technology, Balancer is best placed to serve Matic <> MaticX

**# References/Useful links**



* Website: https://staderlabs.com/

**Protocol description**

*Background on Staderlabs:*

StaderLabs is a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider. We are live on 4 blockchains including Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera.

Within a few months of launch, Stader has more than 770 Mn USD of total assets staking on the platform.

1. ~ $700 M+ Luna staked
2. ~$60 M+ HBAR staked
3. Over 40k+ users staking with Stader smart contracts

Stader Protocol’s native token is the SD Token, and we have incentivized liquidity pools on other DEXes by giving out rewards in SD tokens (listed on coin gecko). 

*About MaticX:*

MaticX is a liquid token that users get when they stake their Matic with Stader. The MaticX tokens are a representation of users’ staked Matic. They allow users to swap them at a later date for their staked Matic and accrued rewards with Stader. Meanwhile, they will be able to use it on multiple protocols on Polygon to participate in DeFi. MaticX is an ERC20 token.

Safety and security are paramount for Stader and we do multiple audits of our smart contracts to safeguard user’s funds. MaticX contracts have been audited successfully by two reputed audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes. 

**Motivation**

Adding incentivization to the Matic<>MaticX pool on Balancer will help unlock the large liquidity currently locked in staked Matic for the Polygon and Balancer community and in the process, bring significant liquidity and trading volumes to the Balancer ecosystem

* Liquid staking is large and MaticX aims to be the primary liquid staking token for Polygon:
  * Staking on polygon currently has ~3bn $ of assets staked. Liquid staking can help unlock a large part of this for use in the Defi ecosystem making this an asset class of interest to the Polygon and Balancer communities
  * Stader’s experience in building strong liquid staking solutions on multiple chains, especially Terra and Hedera, with ~770 mn$ in TVL makes it one of the leading candidates to help unlock this liquidity through MaticX
  * MaticX is off to a strong start within a few weeks of launch with staking TVL for Matic already at 2.5+ Million Matic. We also recently launched staking on the Polygon Mainnet directly (Polygon's staking protocol is native to Ethereum, so Stader Polygon v1 only supported staking Matic on Ethereum) and this will help increase staking penetration and in turn, MaticX
  * We will build deep liquidity for MaticX to truly enable users to unlock their staked assets and participate in Defi on Polygon. The MaticX <> Matic LP is already live on Quickswap and has a liquidity of around 5 million USD with average daily trading volume of $246,333 in the last 7 days (Apr 27-May 3)
  * We expect MaticX to continue to grow in demand as we integrate across more ecosystem partners and also increase overall staking participation in Polygon (currently only 14,000 wallets of total of 140m active wallets stake on Polygon)
* Balancer is best suited to provide deep liquidity for Matic<>MaticX given its unique metastable pool technology, a great fit for liquid staking assets

## Intro

Prior to Linea mainnet, [we proposed deploying](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-333-deploy-balancer-on-linea/4782) Balancer on the network. It was not the right time for a successful collaboration. However, since then, the Linea core team has been working on shipping new tech, onboard top partners, and growing the ecosystem.

Linea offers EVM equivalence, scalability, and reduced transaction costs while maintaining Ethereum's security guarantees through Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The network has seen consistent growth, with current TVL at ~$605.5 M on the network per[ L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/linea), and ~$334M in tracked protocols, according to [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/Linea).

Now is the perfect time to revisit this proposal on growing Balancers' presence on the network.
___

## Proposal Details

### Proposal

This proposal asks the Balancer community to support deployment on the Linea Network and exploration in enabling incentives.

### Motivation

Our motivation is threefold:

1. *Participation in the Surge, liquidity campaign*
2. *To support the growth of Key partners*
3. *Position Balancer as core network infrastructure and innovate on future product developments*

#### 1 | Participation in the Surge

The Surge program is a points based activation focused on growing liquidity and will go live in *1-2* *weeks*. It aims to bootstrap protocols like Balancer, enhancing the ecosystem by distributing points for active liquidity. This will ensure the expansion of available assets through DeFi use cases built on Linea.

Points, represented as non-transferable *ERC20* tokens, will help measure user contributions towards the network's decentralization. By encouraging additional liquidity, we anticipate creating a flywheel effect that bolsters both new use cases and overall network volume.

Linea is committed to including the Balncer protocol in the Surge program within the first 1-2 weeks of going live. *(deployment dependant)*

You can read more about the Surge below:
- [Overview](https://docs.linea.build/use-mainnet/linea-surge/linea-surge-overview)
- [Point Incentive Design](https://docs.linea.build/use-mainnet/linea-surge/linea-surge-model)

#### 2 | Supporting Key Partners

Linea is proud to partner with key protocols. The network's primary focus is expanding our liquid restaking token ecosystem. An example of this effort is our collaboration with RENZO, which has led to [ezETH](https://lineascan.build/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5) growth of over $100M USD. Although there are existing AMM solutions on the network, there's a notable demand for Balancer pools from prominent LRT firms, bridges, and stablecoin issuers.

This demand highlights a unique opportunity to establish significant liquidity on Balancer from the outset. Moreso, leveraging point incentives through the Surge program can catalyze growth across diverse use cases, amplifying the impact of this deployment.

#### 3 | Product Integrations

Linea's strategic positioning to the Consensys product suite, including the decentralized infrastructure network *(DIN)* and MetaMask, opens up various collaboration opportunities in the short term *(< 6 months)* and long term *(> 6 months)* ✨🦊🟧

**Short term,**  Given Balancer's critical role in MetaMask Swaps on other networks, we anticipate it will also emerge as a primary route for swaps on Linea. Further, we would like to keep Protocol Contributors up to date with our collaboration with the MetaMask Portfolio - as we aim to create a hub of Web3 activities for users.

**Long term,** the Linea growth team is committed to working closely with key stakeholders on integrating with upcoming Consensys products. While specifics are non-public, our goal is to bring new user experiences to the ecosystem, by leveraging our product suite.

They highlight the growth and benefits of their network, such as EVM equivalence, scalability, reduced transaction costs, and security guarantees. They mention a liquidity campaign called ""The Surge"" that aims to boost ecosystem growth by distributing points for active liquidity. The text also mentions supporting key partners, product integrations, and the demand for Balancer pools from prominent LRT firms, bridges, and stablecoin issuers. Overall, the sentiment is optimistic and collaborative.",bearish
1903,5289,5289,5289,2023-03-02 11:53:27+00:00,balancer,"### Motivation

There has long been a desire to see Balancer on Avalanche from many in the community. Over the last few months important projects like making it easier for the UI to support new chains and generalized boosted pool support have been completed which removes previous blockers for Balancer to expand to new chains.

In terms of top chains by TVL per Defillama, Avalanche sits between Polygon and Optimism. It’s weathered the bear market quite well, and other metrics like volume are also comparable to networks we’re already deployed on. Importantly, Aave has a large presence on Avalanche and I believe Aave v3 Boosted Pools would be a very popular new primitive for users and developers. Beyond that, there’s a growing market for liquid staked AVAX, in particular sAVAX by Benqi who have signaled an interest in seeing liquidity on Balancer if we were to come. Therefore, Balancer could bring value to Avalanche through its composable liquidity products.

When assessing whether a new chain makes sense I think three important factors are:

* Network size & growth trajectory
* Balancer’s competitive advantage (boosted pools & liquid staked tokens)
* 3rd party incentives

In this case Avalanche is of a similar size to networks we already support and seems at least on par with others in terms of growth/metrics lately. We have a strong partner in Aave for boosted pools and interest from new friends to grow liquid staked AVAX. The DAO has been in early discussions of bootstrapping AVAX incentives but no agreements have been made yet.

Another reason I think expansion is a good idea is because of how effective BIP-19 has been in growing Balancer’s position on networks beyond Ethereum. Before things got derailed with [the issue](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345) disclosed in January we had gained significant ground on Polygon to nearly become the top DEX by TVL. The imminent launch of Aave v3 boosted pools will be a major growth catalyst in key markets like Arbitrum & Polygon and combined with BIP-19 I’m optimistic on our multi-chain future.

### Specification

3. Strong partnership with Aave, particularly for boosted pools, and interest from other parties to grow liquid staked AVAX.
4. The success of BIP-19 in growing Balancer's position on networks beyond Ethereum.
5. The imminent launch of Aave v3 boosted pools being a major growth catalyst in key markets like Arbitrum & Polygon.

## Motivation

The competition between scaling solutions is heating up, and the options for cheap, fast, secure transactions are growing fast. In addition to the technical requirements for deploying Balancer on a Layer 2, it’s hugely beneficial to have strong liquidity pools as soon as possible.

A few months ago, [this vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmUS4xSkxLCyHzJmHruLcq4rfdm8tyJoXu2dvPpNEkDn6i) was passed to allow the Liquidity Mining Committee to allocate BAL rewards for the AAVE/WETH v1 pool. The BPT from this pool is staked in the [Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module) that secures the Aave Protocol. 

## Motivation

The pool currently [contains over $500M](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81) of liquidity. Fernando has been in touch with the Aave team and they have committed to migrating the pool to Balancer v2 later this year or January at latest. As a continued show of good faith in this important partnership, we should maintain the current rate of BAL rewards (12,500 BAL per week) until January 20th, 2022. Currently our commitment to this rate of rewards is set to expire on September 20th.

## Specification

If this proposal is approved, the liquidity mining committee will continue allocating 12,500 BAL per week to the AAVE/WETH v1 pool until January 20th, 2021 or until they complete their migration to v2.",bearish,25.83,2021-09-17 01:51:21+00:00,24.37,24.37,2021-09-19 00:00:00+00:00,5.65234223770808,25.25,-0.0224545102593882,0.8653268218040466,True," The text discusses a proposal to extend Balancer rewards for the AAVE/WETH liquidity pool, currently valued at over $500M, due to an upcoming migration to Balancer v2.
