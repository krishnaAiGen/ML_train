Set Borrow cap to 4.6 Million


Proposal: remove the borrow cap on the cCOMP market.

On last Wednesday’s Community Call (I tried and failed to record the call…next time) we discussed removing the cCOMP borrow cap of 100k COMP. The borrow cap was originally put into place to prohibit someone from using the market to borrow COMP, create a governance proposal, vote, and return the capital in seconds. After the upgrade to Governor Bravo and the installation of a review period, the governance process is significantly more cost-prohibitive for a borrower to obtain the necessary votes to meet the proposal threshold. As well, the review period gives users 48-hours to position their COMP holding for a vote, unlike Governor Alpha which used an instantaneous voting system. If a malicious user were to borrow the required COMP to meet the proposal threshold the community would have sufficient time to defeat their proposal.

Removing the borrow cap will help the COMP market develop. Trading firms (onchain and offchain) utilize money markets like Compound and Aave in their systems to borrow assets and particularly ones that are not abundant in supply in traditional borrow/lend services like BlockFi, Genesis, Nexo, and Celsius. It is helpful for everyone if spot and futures markets are efficient.

Next Steps: Changing the borrow cap does not require a traditional governance proposal since caps are controlled by the community multisig. The multisig holders follow the direction of the community. Below is a 7-day poll for removing the borrow cap on the cCOMP market. If you vote “YES” you think the borrow cap should be removed. If you vote “NO” you do not think the borrow cap should be removed. If the poll revolves to “YES” after the 7-day period the multisig holders will remove the borrow cap.",bullish,311.92,2021-06-28 22:36:58+00:00,330.0,330.0,2021-06-29 00:00:00+00:00,5.7963580405232005,324.53,0.0404270325724543,0.8461525440216064,True," The text discusses a proposal to remove the borrow cap on the cCOMP market in Compound, a decentralized finance platform. The original borrow cap was implemented to prevent manipulation of governance proposals, but with recent updates, it is less of a concern. Removing the cap could benefit trading firms and improve market efficiency. A 7-day poll has been initiated for community feedback on this proposal. If the majority votes ""YES,"" the community multisig will remove the borrow cap. The sentiment appears to be positive towards the potential removal of the borrow cap, with an emphasis on promoting market development and efficiency.",bullish,small

To facilitate community discussion and establish consensus regarding the next steps on Reserve Factors for Compound II, Gauntlet provides the following 3 options. Below, we outline the tradeoffs for each option in more detail. Gauntlet recommends that options 1 and 3 are the most prudent options. Since adjusting Reserve Factors is as much a matter of business strategy as it is of market risk, it is important for the community to find consensus. 


1. **Decrease Reserve Factors by 0.025 for USDT and DAI -** since reserves are currently high enough to cover the 95% tail scenarios showing $0 VaR for all collateral assets, and borrows have sharply declined on the protocol, reducing Reserve Factors is an opportunity to bring interest rates close to the market rate with the goal of driving borrow activity while also gathering data around borrower and supplier elasticity. These assets are also not part of the initial Compound III roll-out and, therefore, relatively isolated from that market. 
    
    ***Limitations and Tradeoffs***: Since we do not have data on borrower elasticity, we cannot model borrower behavior. If users are inelastic to interest rate changes, the reduced reserve factor might result in lost revenues for the protocol. This risk may be acceptable given the low borrow volume at the moment. 
    
2. **Increase Reserve Factors by** **0.025** **for USDT and DAI** - proponents of this option may assume user behavior is inelastic to interest rates, therefore allowing the protocol to capture a larger share of the revenue. Any change in reserve factor would enable the community to gather data on user elasticity to build better models in the future. 
    
    While we support either option to gather data and improve models, Gauntlet does not recommend this option since any user elasticity with respect to this change would push interest rates farther away from the market rate as liquidity leaves the protocol.
    
    ***Limitations and Tradeoffs***: same as above - since we do not have data on elasticity, we cannot model behavior. If users are elastic to this change, an increase in reserve factor could result in decreased revenues for the protocol, the extent to which is unknown given the limited data. 
    
3. **Wait until Compound III is live** - with the changing dynamics to be brought on by Compound III (reserve factor will no longer be set as a global parameter), the community may decide to wait to change reserve factors. 
    
    The **tradeoff** here is that we will collect no information on user elasticity.

Synapse DAO to provide a loan 1,250,000 USD (USDC or USDT) for 12 months to engage with Selini and DWF for market-making across various central exchanges.

Overview

Currently there are no active engagements with Market Makers (MM) for the SYN token on central exchanges (CEX). Previously, Synapse DAO engaged with Amber for market-making across multiple exchanges, but those engagements have concluded. Consequently, this has led to reduced liquidity on the CEXs, causing users to experience significant slippage during large-volume transactions.
This proposal is presented to Synapse DAO to outline the terms for engaging with market makers (MM) to enhance liquidity on centralized exchanges significantly. The objective is to foster a robust market environment where traders can enter and exit positions with minimal slippage and reduced price impact.

Context

Synapse is a prominent protocol in the cross-chain sector, having facilitated $50 billion in cross-chain volume to over 2 million addresses since its inception. With significant protocol upgrades on the horizon, Synapse stands to gain from enhanced liquidity on centralized exchanges (CEX). Currently, some exchanges listing the SYN token are experiencing liquidity shortages, leading to substantial slippage when users attempt to execute sizable trades.
Moreover, the absence of an active market maker may lead to the delisting of SYN from exchanges due to failure to meet volume and spread targets. Additionally, partnering with crypto-native market makers offers opportunities to pursue additional exchange listings and subsequently enhance liquidity provision. An expansion would broaden the trading landscape for SYN, potentially attracting new users who exclusively engage with centralized exchanges.
Various market makers were approached to formulate this proposal and after careful consideration, we believe that engaging with two market makers, Selini and DWF, aligns best for the Synapse DAO.

Terms

Globally the terms are as followed, note that engagements differ in both the finer details and the loaned amount per market maker.

The Synapse DAO, through Synapse Foundation would engage with both Selini and DWF;
The Synapse DAO would provide a 1,250,000 USD loan (USDC/USDT) for 12 months for market making purposes;
In the event not enough liquidity is available to meet the terms set forth, Synapse DAO may swap non-$SYN assets held in treasury to meet obligations;
At the end of the term the market makers can exercise a call option on the loan at 110% of the first 7-day TWAP price and repay the loan in stables or in $SYN;
Exchanges covered by the MM are: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Gate, KuCoin, Phemex, Crypto.com, Bitget and MEXC;
Subject to 95% uptime.

Synopsis:

With the introduction of Kanpai and a Treasury Payout Ratio, this proposal is a modification of the previously set payout ratio from 10% to 100% of the Sushi fees to the Treasury. Payout Ratio to the Treasury will stay in place for one year or until new tokenomics are implemented. 

Premise of the proposal is roughly the same from the signal vote, but with clear guidelines set in place for the timeline of the enacted proposal. The proposal ensures that the 100% ratio of fees to the Treasury will only be in effect for a maximum of one year from when the signal vote passed on Dec 19th 2022. Thus, this means that a hard-stop will be in place for Dec 19th 2023 and the Kanpai payout ratio will revert back to 10% to Treasury and 100% to Sushi Bar. Also, implementation of new tokenomics will also be a cause for a hard stop on the fee re-direct and migrating to the new structure once it’s passed through governance/development and is ready to integrate.

Additionally, a governance dashboard will be developed to give full transparency & insights into the operations budget and the treasury’s assets. 

To summarize the proposal seeks to direct 100% of the revenue earned through fees to the Treasury, with two conditions causing a hard stop:

1. A year has passed with no tokenomics in place (Dec 19th 2023)
2. New tokenomics being implemented 

Revenue to the treasury will be in the form of 50% ETH and 50% USDC, with projection of ~$6m being earned over the next year if this proposal were to pass.

100% fees to the Treasury with a hard-stop in 1 year or when new tokenomics are implemented

Synopsis:
Restructuring Sushi’s token model will help cement its role in the protocol’s ongoing success and contribute to its growth. Since its launch, Sushi has been at the forefront of tokenomics with initiatives like MasterChef and xSushi. We aim to present a token model that sets us on a sustainable growth path and long-term strategy. In January, we published an initial draft, which, thankfully, generated meaningful feedback from the Sushi and DeFi community, and we believe this final draft represents the best model curated from that feedback.

As Kanpai expires in December of this year and Sushi’s current distribution model quickly approaches full distribution, our new proposal outlines our vision for a revised Sushi token model crafted to ensure stability and sustained value for all stakeholders. The model builds on three pillars: protocol sustainability, token utility enhancement, and treasury diversification. We invite you to review the proposed changes showcased in our paper, which will synergize to support a resilient token economy.

Below is a brief overview of the new model’s mechanics and goals.

Challenges and Solutions
We’ve identified several challenges through thorough analysis.
Here’s a brief on what we’ve found and our proposed solutions:
We aim to improve rewards efficiency, reducing the annual cost of Sushi emissions.
Establish a balanced approach to its emissions distribution. 
Currently, the emissions-to-Sushi-Bar income suggests a 1:1 ratio.
Financial Stability: Address the current emissions-to-income ratio.
LP Incentives: Sushi LP incentives need recalibrating to remain competitive.
Staking Mechanisms: Revise xSushi staking to serve high-conviction participants better.
xSushi Distribution: Align xSushi staking to provide fairer distribution among participants.

Economic Model
Our economic model scales strategically via innovation, such as:
Trading Fees: A primary revenue source from LP transactions
Routing Fees: Income from trade fees via aggregation
Staking Fees: Potential revenue from staking rewards
Partnerships: Strategic partnerships

Stakeholder Considerations
Align our tokenomics with the interests of our key stakeholders:
Liquidity Providers (LPs): Aimed at ensuring long-term incentives.
xSushi: Stable supply, non-dilutive rewards, and governance.
Traders: Offer an improved trading experience with low slippage.
Token Projects, DAOs: Building long-term partnerships.
Sushi Treasury: Ensure diversified and sustainable income.

Goals for a Redesigned Token Model
The revised proposal has several objectives:
Promote decentralized ownership.
Amplify liquidity.
Encourage sustainable growth.
Enhance the protocol’s sustainability.
Bolster $SUSHI utility.

Sushi Vesting :
Almost three months ago, we’ve agreed[1] 13 to vest ⅔ of newly minted Sushi for 6 months. There was no clear implementation of the vesting and its release, and it ended up being more of a workaround controlled by the multi-sig.

We’re slowly coming closer to the 6-month mark, which means that we start figuring out the distribution and its details.

Option #1: Airdrop the vested Sushi at the 6-month mark and get rid of the vesting. The transaction costs would be subtracted from the total airdrop amount, spreading the costs evenly between the receivers. The total number of vested Sushi at the 6-month mark should be ~47,040,732.

Option #1.1: Airdrop the vested Sushi monthly beginning at the 6-month mark (end of March) and get rid of the vesting. This would increase transaction costs a bit but at the same time would decrease the sudden inflation.

The Sushi would be airdropped beginning with the smallest balances, ending with the highest ones.

Option #2: Similar approach to Balancer’s claims - use a smart contract that would allow claiming every week. This would cost us almost nothing, but the receivers would have to bear much higher gas costs, possibly preventing smaller farmers from claiming their Sushi.

Option #1+2: Airdrop vested balances under 1000 Sushi, get rid of the vesting, use the smart contract approach for bigger balances.

All of these options are broken down in the forum post[2].

Team’s thoughts
Option 1 is preferred, primarily because it’s the lowest risk. This is $300M+ worth of SUSHI, so a mistake could be very costly. The simpler the code for this, the better.

The goal of option 1.1 may be to spread out the inflation, but I’m not convinced we understand the impact of a single release (ripping off the band-aid) vs. a prolonged period of increased inflation. So I’d prefer the simpler solution.

If the whales are ok with us charging them the tx costs, that’s ok, but the dev fund paying these works for me too.

Overall I don’t feel very strongly about this, option 2 feels unfair towards smaller balances, but option 1+2 fixes that. As long as we get some serious audits done on the code, certainly with option 2 or 1.1.

(There was talk about ‘withholding’ some drops from farms, etc. I assume that idea has been abandoned (I hope so)? Not to be confused with helping farms drop directly to their users, which seems like a great idea.)


Option 1 would be preferred for simplicity. I believe the market will price this in quickly, and it’s less prone to human error.

Option 2 is a better solution and the Sushi not claimed can go back in the treasury after x amount of weeks. I think withholding Sushi to specific smart contracts is also important since their sole purpose is to sell. We should make sure community members are rewarded instead of mercenary liquidity. If MarketMakers are aware of this change in fundamentals well in advance there won't be any impact on the price and everyone will be properly hedged out so the sudden release shouldn't have much impact similar to what happened with the recent SOL unlock.

Solana is a fast blockchain -- probably the fastest.  It can support over 50k tps without sharding, and costs about $0.00002 per transaction.

Serum is an on-chain DeFi ecosystem built on Solana.  The first core piece of it, an on-chain DEX, went live last week.

Notes: This is submitted on behalf of EcoSerum, a Serum node.  I am Sam Bankman-Fried.  I am involved in the development of Serum but have not been involved in the development of Sushi in any way.  This proposal is not on behalf of or related to FTX.  I have exposure to both SRM and SUSHI.


Proposal

The Sushi community builds out support for Sushiswap on Solana
Sushi rewards are paid to both Ethereum and Solana/Serum based Sushiswap
Proportional to the TLV in each
Or alternately fixed to each pool
The Sushi community composes this with the Serum orderbooks
Each Sushi pool has a curve, currently constant-product
The pool sends bids/offers into the associated Serum orderbook to simulate that curve
This allows the Sushi AMM to share liquidity and volume with the orderbook
FTX has a bridge from ERC20 <> SPL (Solana token) Sushi; in the next week, sollet.io will as well
Sushi will also be able to compose with a borrow/lending protocol on Serum to allow the pools to trade on margin, though that’s not necessary for V1

Rewards

EcoSerum, a Serum node that helps build out the community, will give the following rewards:
50k SRM for 1+2
1 locked MegaSerum for 1-5
One MegaSerum is 1 million Serum put together
This will allow the Sushi community to participate in Serum, run a node, receive yield, benefit from a buy/burn, and receive discounts
This will be locked (not sellable or transferable) for 1-7 years: fully locked until Aug 1 2021, and then unlocking linearly over the 6 years after that
These rewards are for the Sushi community, controlled by governance, to do what they want with
In addition, 20k SRM for 1+2 and another 10k for 1-5 to the team who builds it

There seems to be a general consensus that it would be good to reduce unlocked SUSHI emissions in favor of locked emissions.

The current consensus based on past polls seems to be that ⅔ of the SUSHI emissions should be locked and ⅓ should be unlocked.  Some also want to take down total emissions, others don’t.  In addition there has been discussion of a hard cap on Sushi supply.

This poll is to establish two things:

Should we move forward with that?
If so, which of two implementation paths should we follow?

One path is to fully implement this, and then release it; that will likely take a few weeks.

Another path is to first reduce emissions, and then implement the locked up parts and retroactively reward liquidity providers with the locked portion.

Taking emissions down can be done by pointing them at a dead pool.  Vesting can be done by pointing them at a pool controlled by a contract which implements vesting.  Temporary measures could be done by reducing total emissions if desired with a dead pool, and then pointing vesting emissions at a pool controlled by the multisig which would later redistribute, locked, to stakers.  There are other ways to do these as well.

So here is a poll.


Note: this will take a minimum of 300k total SUSHIPOWAH to pass

Option 1: ⅔ of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, ⅓ unlocked; wait to change anything until fully ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever

Option 2: ⅔ of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, ⅓ unlocked; immediately take emissions down by 66%, and then apply the locked portion (including retroactively) once the code is ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever

Option 3: Take total emissions down by 50%; ⅔ of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, ⅓ unlocked; wait to change anything until fully ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever

Option 4:Take total emissions down by 50%; ⅔ of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, ⅓ unlocked; immediately take emissions down by 83%, and then apply the locked portion (including retroactively) once the code is ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever

**TL;DR:**

- The current emissions are too aggressive and do not properly incentivize long term participation in the ecosystem.
- This proposal aims to change the output of new $SUSHI and add a lock-up period to encourage participants to stay in the ecosystem longer.
- I'm proposing:
-- Cutting the emissions after the migration from 100 $SUSHI per block to:
--- 50 $SUSHI per block in Year 1 & 2
--- 25 $SUSHI per block in Year 3 & 4
--- 10 $SUSHI per block in Year 5
-Additionally:
-- 2/3rds of new $SUSHI issued is locked for a one year vesting period.
-- Locked $SUSHI is still able to earn fee payments but cannot be sold or used in voting until it is unlocked.

Explanation:

Right now the rate of $SUSHI inflation is too high and over dilutes individuals contributing to the ecosystem.

This scaled design aims to lower the emission of $SUSHI while still rewarding liquidity providers.

By lowering the token emission over time, the expectation is that $SUSHI's price will be rising and so that LPs can expect the same payout rate but not overly dilute the total supply.

The lock up period also allows them to earn from the token without the constant downward pressure.

Comparing the two models:
![](https://i.imgur.com/y5txkRd.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/ACiXkFb.png)

The proposed model would leave us with around 600M tokens in Year 5 instead of the 1.5B currently planned.

**Pros:**
- Rewards early participants.
- Lowers the emission of the token.
- Removes the downward sell pressure by creating a lockup.
- The lockup still allows users to gain upside from the project.
- Promotes long term involvement.

**Cons:**
- If token price doesn't rise fast enough it could be not enough to support LPs.
- Will have a disproportionate impact on our dev fund which was drained during the early bonus period.",bullish,2.88,2020-09-09 03:37:52+00:00,3.145,3.145,2020-09-10 00:00:00+00:00,9.20138888888889,2.546,-0.1159722222222222,0.8388804495334625,True," The text proposes a change in SUSHI emissions rate and introduces a lock-up period to encourage long-term participation, reward early participants, lower token emission, and reduce downward sell pressure.

SushiHouse is a Set Token that was setup by Yam’s treasury management team to diversify into assets for bear market protection.

Redemption vote is straightforward and just requires the Treasury multisig to breakdown SushiHouse tokens and redeem funds back to the Treasury.

Sell-off of funds will require Treasury to look into whether OTC or on-chain settlements are the better option for selling off assets, and will go with w/e approach results in smaller amount of slippage from the swaps. Likely being that OTC is the better option for selling out of these tokens.

https://forum.sushi.com/t/kanpai-bear-market-protection-with-treasury-revenue/4310

Synopsis:
Introduce a governance-controlled ‘payout ratio’ parameter (initially set to 95% or 90%). This will divert a portion of trading fees (100% - payout ratio) from xSUSHI stakers to the Treasury as revenue denominated in ETH. For example at a payout ratio of 95%, xSUSHI holders are paid out 95% of the 5bps. Introducing retained earnings will offer valuable bear market protection as well as allow SUSHI holders to govern a new cash flow, which could be used to reinvest in growth or generate non-operating income.

Implementation is short and sweet with just a couple of lines of code added to SushiMakerV2 so that a ‘payout ratio’ can be set and diverted to the treasury. Payout ratio will be adjustable, and can go under further governance votes to increase or decrease the percentage taken for the treasury.

This is a 2 part proposal, with 1st part being the vote on executing the Implementation and 2nd part being the vote on the initial ‘payout ratio’ set.

TL;DR
The Treasury’s current near 100% SUSHI allocation could prove to be risky in the event a prolonged bear market occurs, so the Treasury is in need of expanding its ongoing diversification efforts. By diverting a portion of the fees to the Treasury, this would give Sushi enough revenue every year to cover operational expenses and also an ample surplus to invest in low-risk assets to further diversify the Treasury and bring in non-operating income (e.g. by yield farming, providing liquidity on SushiSwap, staking ETH).

The original proposal and community dialogue can be viewed here: https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/codename-bonsai-proposal-for-building-out-sushiswap-on-solana-and-serum/2653/25

We're really excited and humbled to see both the success of Raydium so far, and the general support of the idea of a partnership in the SushiSwap community to support the building out of many key Sushi features on Solana and Serum.

We’re also grateful for the feedback received on the initial proposal and during the recent conversation at the Sushi Forum on Discord. We’ve heard a lot about what the community would like to see and have worked out additional details on the partnership and what execution would look like.

Key areas are outlined below:
* Bonsai: The addition of SushiSwap pools on Solana
* SushiSwap and Raydium partnership
* Bonsai pool structure and incentives
* Fees, performance and protocol dynamics
* Platform integration

**Bonsai: The addition of SushiSwap pools on Solana:**

The purpose of this partnership is to allow Sushi to expand its reach and community to Solana and Serum, with the initial and primary feature of creating new SushiSwap liquidity pools (LPs) on these ecosystems *in addition* to existing Ethereum based LPs. 

The key point here is that LPs built out by Raydium will be an addition to Sushi’s current pools. This *is not* a liquidity migration, but a method for Sushi to create new pools which are able to leverage the speed and efficiency of Solana, interact with the liquidity of Serum’s central order book, and expand to reach a wider community and project base. Sushi’s Ethereum based pools will remain untouched and as is.

As the objective is to extend the reach of SushiSwap, Bonsai pools aim to focus on projects on Solana and Serum. Bonsai could be thought of similar to Onsen, as a way to branch out to Solana-native assets and grow along with the projects in the ecosystem.

For the SushiSwap user, these Solana based pools would appear as a new page on the SushiSwap UI, named Bonsai. This page would have similar front-end functionality and GUI to current Sushi Farms and Onsen pools, but would simply connect to Raydium’s backend for execution. A similar SushiSwap page would also be implemented on Raydium’s front-end. Mockups for proposed pages can be found on the original proposal


**SushiSwap and Raydium partnership**

With the objective of ensuring a long-term partnership where both teams are on the same path, it’s important to align incentives. In order to achieve this:

* Sushi and Raydium would agree to a token swap to ensure mutual commitment
* We propose an exchange of 1% of the total RAY supply (5.55m tokens) at a favorable price of $0.325 per RAY for an equivalent value ($1.8m) of SUSHI at market price. 
* At $0.325 per RAY, this indicates a FDV for Raydium at $180m, while the RAY would hold a current market price of approximately $55m at the time of writing
* These favorable terms are put forward in order to maintain the integrity and price of a previously discussed token swap with the Sushi team and to further show long term commitment to the relationship from Raydium.
* RAY tokens would come from Raydium’s Partnership & Ecosystem reserve.
* Tokens on both sides would be locked with a one year cliff and vesting linearly over the following 24 months.

**Bonsai pool structure and incentives**

The vision for Bonsai is a branch of SushiSwap that extends and focuses on key projects on Solana, and this would initially focus on Solana-native assets such as SOL, SRM, and FIDA for example. As the ecosystem grows, Bonsai would grow alongside it and incorporate additional relevant pools into Sushi’s offering which would otherwise be a challenge for Sushi to include.

1 - SUSHI incentives
We propose a SUSHI incentive structure for Bonsai similar to that of Onsen, which relies on 2,000 allocation points (AP) distributed to each pool relative to the project’s total market cap. 

However instead of a tiered system based on market cap, we propose tiers based on Total Value Locked (TVL) for Bonsai. This would mean that APs are allocated based on the pools’ TVL on the Bonsai platform, which then determines the SUSHI incentives distributed to LPs.

By using a TVL model for the AP tiers, this structure encourages greater liquidity on Bonsai and naturally selects for higher quality projects. 

2 - Expected Total and SUSHI TVL

While we expect Bonsai to start out with a smaller number of Solana focused pools, it’s important to set a maximum cap for the number of pools. We propose this to be capped at 40, a significantly smaller number than Onsen’s 58, to ensure that pools and SUSHI incentives are reserved for high quality projects. We also propose that 10 of the 40 pools be reserved as SUSHI pairs to further incentivize and lock SUSHI liquidity. This means that approximately 12.5% of all TVL on Bonsai will be in the form of SUSHI.

As a function of the tiered pool structure, the relative TVL, and the APs assigned, we estimate that overall TVL for Bonsai will amount to between $180M and $620M when the max pool cap of 40 is reached. This translates to between $22.5M and $77.5M of SUSHI TVL in the pools.

3 - RAY incentives (Double Yield)

With both SushiSwap and Raydium working together, Raydium would incentivize Bonsai pools with the native RAY token. Total RAY incentives would be equal to or greater than the total SUSHI rewards distributed to Bonsai LPs. This means attractive double yields for farms on Bonsai, similar to what is discussed in the SushiSwap MIRIN article for franchised pools. We see this as an immediate value add for the community and a strong competitive advantage which is likely to increase reach and liquidity for Sushi Bonsai pools. 

Raydium would work alongside the SushiSwap team to determine appropriate double yield rewards for specific pools that the community wishes to incentivize.

4 - Incentives for xSUSHI holders

In line with SushiSwap’s SUSHI staking rewards, 0.05% of fees will be collected from Bonsai trades as rewards for xSUSHI. These fees will be used to buy SUSHI from Bonsai pools and then that SUSHI will be sent over to SushiSwap on Ethereum to reward xSUSHI holders. This is a clear method for xSUSHI holders to benefit from the expansion of Sushi.

**Fees, performance and protocol dynamics**

Many questions were brought up about the numbers behind Raydium so we’ve covered the below questions in a reply to the original proposal. If you’d like to dive deeper, you can view that here: https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/codename-bonsai-proposal-for-building-out-sushiswap-on-solana-and-serum/2653/64?u=gamma
1)  How will fees be split between LPs, Sushi and Raydium?
2)  How do Serum fees work and how is Raydium able to earn 30bps per trade for Bonsai?
3)  So why trade on Bonsai or Raydium if the cost is the same?
4)  Won’t competition from other liquidity providers impact Raydium’s volume and profits?
5)  How do you deal with arbitrageurs in a fast moving and low fee environment?
6)  So if traders get better slippage, LPs capture more profits while arbitrageurs can still make their share, then who’s losing?
7)  What is this Fibonacci sequence you’re talking about?

**Platform Integration**

Upon passing of the proposal, Raydium will commit the majority of resources to working alongside the SushiSwap team to start building out support for Bonsai pools on Solana, with a proposed plan for estimated timing and resources as below:

* Raydium has all front-end JavaScript connections already prepared for use by Sushi. Ideally, Sushi would be able to provide a front-end developer and/or designer to connect these in line with Sushi UI standards. However, Raydium is also able to go ahead and produce this page within 4-5 days. 
* Raydium would need 3-4 days to make sure that all of Sushi’s functions are properly recreated
* At least another 3-4 days is recommended for comprehensive testing from both teams before launch.
* Setting up of a parallel page on Raydium for Sushi Bonsai pools could be done in 2-3 days.

The entire process could likely be completed within a couple of weeks, however communication, finalizing of details, and testing may add to that. Following the completion of the initial Bonsai pools, Raydium would continue to work closely with Sushi to provide full support on Bonsai as well as for additional features wherever it seems most valuable for the community.",bullish,17.931,2021-03-10 11:47:57+00:00,19.266,19.266,2021-03-11 00:00:00+00:00,7.44520662539734,19.008,0.0600635770453403,0.8519313931465149,True,"1. The proposed integration between SushiSwap and Raydium on Solana (Bonsai) aims to create a multi-chain DEX ecosystem that leverages the benefits of both platforms.

2. Approximately 12.5% of TVL on Bonsai will be in the form of SUSHI, translating to between $22.5M and $77.5M of SUSHI TVL in the pools when the max pool cap of 40 is reached.

3. Raydium will incentivize Bonsai pools with RAY token as part of a double yield farming strategy, with total RAY incentives equal to or greater than SUSHI rewards distributed to Bonsai LPs.

4. 0.05% of fees from Bonsai trades will be collected as rewards for xSUSHI holders, benefiting them from the expansion of Sushi on Solana.

5. The proposal addresses several questions about fees, performance, and protocol dynamics, providing explanations for how fees will be split, how Serum fees work, and how Raydium can earn 30bps per trade for Bonsai.

6. Upon passing the proposal, Raydium plans to dedicate resources to building out support for Bonsai pools on Solana, with an estimated timeline of a few weeks for completion. Following this, Raydium will continue to work closely with SushiSwap to provide full support and additional features for the community.",bullish,small

**TL;DR:**
- Right now, we are electing multisig holders who should sign transactions approved by the community.
- We need to clearly define community approval.
- This proposal is that signers should only sign transactions that have at least 3 voting days and pass with:

--  A 1% quorum at a 75% majority vote,
-- A 4% quorum at a 60% majority vote,
-- Or, a 6% quorum at a simple 51% majority vote.

- The exception being when user funds are at risk of exploit.


**Explanation:**

Right now, there is no minimums as to what constitutes a 'community decision' which means multisig signers would have to make a subjective judgement on if a vote has passed or not.

The only objective case right now would be if 100% voter turn out was met with a >51% majority vote.

Right now, if a vote received a 51% majority vote, but only had a 2k Sushi voting on it, or was only live for one hour of voting, it would be contested as to if the vote should pass or not.

For this sake, during the duration in which we have multisig signers, we should hold those multisig signers to an agreed standard.

From other examples we've seen with Compound, it is doable (although not easy) to get a 4% voter turnout on key issues.

We also know based on [The Law of Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) that the more voters who vote, the more representative of the actual population the voting choice is. Therefore we can create a sliding scale.

I am proposing that:

A) All votes are scheduled for no less than 3 days.
B) Votes 'passing' are on a rated schedule of:

--  A 1% quorum at a 75% majority vote,
-- A 4% quorum at a 60% majority vote,
-- Or, a 6% quorum at a simple 51% majority vote.

This means the more voters who show up, the easier it is to pass the vote, as we can be more confident that it represents a vast majority of the users.

This prevents manipulation from whales or colluding whales, as well as people trying to sneak through quick votes.

But, it also gives grounds for votes to pass if they have low voter turn out but are still very popular, as we should recognize it is hard to motivate users into governance.

**Pros:**
- Clear rules for when signers should sign or not sign from a vote.
- Community now recognizes the vote thresholds needed and can hold signers accountable.
- Prevents votes being pushed through by a single whale, or colluding whales.
- Prevents votes being snuck through in quick turn around times.
- Allows votes to pass based on a confidence curve, not penalizing something for a low voter turnout if it is representative of a majority interest.
- Enforces the default state of proposals being rejected unless they are strongly desired by the community.

**Cons:**
- Leans towards denying votes on small issues that cannot get excitement for larger voter turnout (although attempts to address with thresholds)
- Slightly harder to keep track of as % are different at different levels.",bullish,2.88,2020-09-09 00:25:37+00:00,3.145,3.145,2020-09-10 00:00:00+00:00,9.20138888888889,2.546,-0.1159722222222222,0.8897175490856171,True," The text proposes a new standard for community approval in multisig transactions, requiring a minimum of 3 days for votes and a varying majority vote percentage based on the quorum size.

This aims to provide clear rules for when signers should sign or not sign from a vote, and to hold signers accountable. The proposal also addresses the issue of small issues that may not garner large voter turnout by setting specific thresholds.",bullish,small

Introducing Onsen, our new liquidity mining incentivization program, a replacement of our Menu of the Week initiative intended to bring positive long-term liquidity changes as well as ensure stability of our platform.

Bringing new liquidity onto our exchange, decreasing slippage, expanding our pool offerings and creating exciting synergistic partnerships with other DeFi projects. Onsen allows tokens that are voted to become accredited to participate in our liquidity mining program.

58 tokens pairs will be eligible to receive accreditation. Every 60 days, the accredited list is re-evaluated to ensure that there is maximum capital efficiency for the SushiSwap ecosystem.

Onsen has 2000 allocation points (AP) set aside for it. These AP are what determine how much of our new token emissions (SUSHI minting) are awarded to incentivized Onsen pairs, the same way we allocate rewards to the permanent menu.

So how do we decide what token deserves what percentage of rewards? And how do we ensure that it benefits both the project in question and SushiSwap’s protocol as a whole?

By using a new weighting method to ensure that accredited tokens receive allocation points proportionate to their market cap!

Out of the 2000 AP, MISO (Minimal Initial Sushi Offering) projects get to take part of a 200 AP reserve that will initially be reserved for 3 months.

The remaining 1800 AP are divided based on the market cap size of the applicant token. To keep this manageable, we have created 3 categories according to market cap size average;

Midcap (25m-100m Market cap)

13 pairs maximum
100 AP per pair
Lowcap (25m-5m Market cap)

25 pairs maximum
20 AP per pair
Gems (5m-1m Market cap)

20 pairs maximum
10 AP per pair
We will make it easy for projects to contribute to a Joint Liquidity Mining contract in a few weeks by releasing a wrapped MasterChef contract where they will be able to distribute their own tokens in addition to Sushi. (Double the yield!)

As there are some projects already participating in a Joint Liquidity Mining initiative with us, or moving their liquidity to SushiSwap, we will accredit $AMPL, $zLOT and $SEEN tokens from the very beginning.

Applying to the Onsen program, applicants must send 1000 SUSHI or 2 ETH to be used in permanent, irrevocable liquidity provisioning in the SUSHI-ETH pool to ensure serious projects are partaking in the process.

This accounts for a total of 58 pairs, contributing a total of 58 000 SUSHI burned or 116 ETH locked in liquidity every 90 days (Note: For the first round the first 25 pairs to apply won’t have to contribute any fee), as specified per basic application requirements seen in the next section.

Community-Enabled Analytics (CEA) is proposed as a solution to develop a community of nearly 500 individuals that attack analytic challenges in real time for Sushi. The program is designed to drive on-demand data needs - as well as customer acquisition, ecosystem growth and token circulation.

The forum post describes CEO as a free solution with a bounty program to incentivize and reward community members for learning about, analyzing, and publishing blockchain data.

The proposal requests a grant of 1M USD annually in $SUSHI to fund the CEA program for Sushi, which may be renewed on an annual basis.

There seems to be a general consensus that it would be good to reduce unlocked SUSHI emissions in favor of locked emissions.

The current consensus based on past polls seems to be that ⅔ of the SUSHI emissions should be locked and ⅓ should be unlocked. Some also want to take down total emissions, others don’t. In addition there has been discussion of a hard cap on Sushi supply.

This poll is to establish two things:

Should we move forward with that?
If so, which of two implementation paths should we follow?

One path is to fully implement this, and then release it; that will likely take a few weeks.

Another path is to first reduce emissions, and then implement the locked up parts and retroactively reward liquidity providers with the locked portion.

Taking emissions down can be done by pointing them at a dead pool. Vesting can be done by pointing them at a pool controlled by a contract which implements vesting. Temporary measures could be done by reducing total emissions if desired with a dead pool, and then pointing vesting emissions at a pool controlled by the multisig which would later redistribute, locked, to stakers. There are other ways to do these as well.

So here is a poll.

Note: this will take a minimum of 300k total SUSHIPOWAH to pass

Option 1: ⅔ of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, ⅓ unlocked; wait to change anything until fully ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever

Option 2: ⅔ of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, ⅓ unlocked; immediately take emissions down by 66%, and then apply the locked portion (including retroactively) once the code is ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever

Option 3: Take total emissions down by 50%; ⅔ of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, ⅓ unlocked; wait to change anything until fully ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever

Option 4:Take total emissions down by 50%; ⅔ of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, ⅓ unlocked; immediately take emissions down by 83%, and then apply the locked portion (including retroactively) once the code is ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever

Synopsis:

SushiHouse is a Set Token that was setup by Yam’s treasury management team to diversify into assets for bear market protection.

Due to the management team to manage these funds not being in place anymore, this proposal is to determine if Sushi Treasury should redeem the funds that currently makeup the SushiHouse tokens back to the Treasury.

This is a 2-part proposal, with part 1 being the implementation vote on the redemption of SushiHouse funds to the treasury. While part 2 will determine if the funds redeemed should be fully sold for stables or not.

Redemption vote is straightforward and just requires the Treasury multisig to breakdown SushiHouse tokens and redeem funds back to the Treasury.

Sell-off of funds will require Treasury to look into whether OTC or on-chain settlements are the better option for selling off assets, and will go with w/e approach results in smaller amount of slippage from the swaps. Likely being that OTC is the better option for selling out of these tokens.

We are voting today to bring onboard 4 new core devs

-BoringCrypto
 -Clearwood 
-I’m Software 
 -Joseph Delong

I’ll do a small prompt for each candidates and why they were selected  (I’ve added “titles” but I believe they mean nothing in an org like SushiSwap):   -BoringCrypto (architect - core dev)  Any community members involved in the Discord or Forum knows him.   He is behind BentoBox and crucial in our development cycle.   You can read more about him in this proposal : 
https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/hire-boringcrypto-me-as-lead-architect-for-sushi/1699  

 -Clearwood (core dev)  Clearwood joined Sushiswap a few months ago he has been involved in the QA and various other tasks of BentoBox and sushi-data. He is a very prolific contributor and has been selected because I believe he is essential to the continuity of the project.
 You can read a proposal he posted here : https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/team-proposal-clearwood/1591 

-I’m Software (core dev)   I’m Software has been involved in the amazing https://analytics.sushiswap.fi ,  and in a range of tasks that are deemed an extraordinary contribution by everyone in the core team.   He wrote a little more about himself here : https://hackmd.io/6g6GEMzPTMWlC6Dl77bM-A    -Joe Delong (CTO-core dev)  

Our last hire would be Joseph, he is our newest addition and less known by community members. He would join the core team as someone who can add a dimension of management and technical knowledge, which is key.  I am highly confident that his participation will be instrumental and his direction concerning our L2 decisions will highly profit us, from his deep knowledge of the Ethereum protocol. He is an ex-ConsenSys, Eth2 Core Developer, and previously Cruise Director of TXRX Ethereum 2.0 research team.   Compensation :  BoringCrypto would receive a different compensation considering a few factors.  - He has been involved since the beginning and we judged it was fair for him to be on the same playing field as the earlier core team members for this reason.   60k USD + 250k Sushi (identical to Levx contract)  75k Sushi (rest of the grant for BentoBox)   removal of the 1% dev share to BentoBox   9% -> 10% to xSushi holders   Vested 1 year via Sablier.finance   Clearwood - I’m Software - Joe  They will be entitled to the new hiring guidelines decided by the community.   From what surfaced so far :

- A variable base compensation of 0 USDC to 120k USDC (decided by the team member in line with their risk appetite)
- Rest of the compensation paid in Sushi with a cap to 300k in total remuneration the peg price for Sushi has been set at the 22 December when the negotiation for salary were started by 0xMaki.
- A signing bonus of 20k Sushi.
- Cliff of 1 month before starting the Sushi sablier in case the hire is unsuccessful or not a good fit  (the team reserve the right to terminate the hire if deemed necessary)
- Sushiswap will cover any legal fees if needed
- Sushiswap will cover up to 5000-10 000$ for taxes/accounting on presentation of invoice and verification made by 0xMaki
- Performance bonuses (decided by community e.g. if BentoBox does 50m$ in fees for xSushi holders etc. TBA)
  All of the candidates here are self-starters and top talent. In an industry where it takes months to find a suitable candidate, there is risk attached to taking this job opportunity. This is for 1 year and will be revisited at the end of the contract.   Sushiswap will make sure we can ship and stay relevant in this competitive space.   Delivering on our entire roadmap that will be published very.. soon 👀    (All current core devs will also be under the new hiring guidelines after their contract duration is over.)",bullish,3.951,2021-01-07 02:51:37+00:00,4.488,4.488,2021-01-08 00:00:00+00:00,13.59149582384207,4.4785,0.133510503669957,0.9093977808952332,True," The text discusses a vote to bring on four new core developers for SushiSwap, a decentralized finance platform.

Additionally to the these members being proposed to sit on the Treasury, the following will also be implemented:

- An ongoing list of potential Multisig signers in a queue in a post on the Forum in the event that a current member is inactive or wants to step down.
- Include a review process of 3 months for signers activity and engagement to ensure participation and involvement. 
- Include a process for offboarding signers and onboarding new ones through Multisig review process, and vote from Forum. 
- As there would be too much complexity with managing a USD Price range for tokens, it is proposed to simply do 10,000 USDC steamed via Furo to each of the Multisig signers. In the event of a signer leaving, Furo streams will be canceled and sent back to the Treasury.

\
This proposal aims to cover important smart contract upgrades that will allow for the rescue of user funds, improved pausing functionality and additional safeguards via blacklisting.

This proposal will not cover the **execution** of the proposed rescue function and unpausing. Those items will be addressed later via a future BIP.

Specifics:
-
\
**Upgrade all affected Setts with the following new functionality:**

* add **rescue function** to transfer sett tokens from attacker wallets to recovered.badgerdao.eth (one time use - patchBalance() function)
* add a ‘**global pause**’ feature that allows all Sett contracts to be paused and unpaused simultaneously with the same permissions as current pausing functionality
* add global **blacklist** to block actions, set to the attackers wallets listed below

**Blacklisted Attacker wallets:**

* 0x1FCdb04d0C5364FBd92C73cA8AF9BAA72c269107
* 0xa33B95ea28542Ada32117B60E4F5B4cB7D1Fc19B

**NOTE**: Approval to execute the following actions will be submitted via a future BIP that will undergo the Badger Governance Process:

* Execute the new patchBalances() function to rescue funds from the attacker to the recovery multisig
* Unpausing the Sett contract to resume normal operation

Why is this BIP being expedited?
-
\
Badger is committed to reopening smart contracts as soon as it is safe to do so. Given the timelock considerations, waiting for the standard timeframe before making these upgrades would add a minimum 3 day lag once the final BIP to execute the proposed actions to rescue funds and unpause is decided.

As such, this proposal uncouples the smart contract upgrades from the execution of the rescue action and unpausing so that the execution decision can follow Badger’s governance process, while also ensuring the resulting governance decision can be enacted promptly.

Amended requirements to pass expedited governance proposal:
-
\
Given this BIP will go directly to snapshot, it will require a supermajority of over 70% at a quorum of more than 200,000 votes in order to pass.

Supporting Parameter Changes:
-
\
Additionally, among the older contracts, 1 Sett and 8 Strategy contracts have the Timelock set as their governance address. In order to align them with the rest of the infrastructure, Badger will change their governance to the [devMultisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB65cef03b9B89f99517643226d76e286ee999e77).

This will give Badger the ability to handle unpausing and transferring tokens away from attacker wallets atomically and with agility, which is the preferred technical approach to the situation. Badger intends to propose using the timelock for all key parameter changes as part of the future governance 2.0 initiatives.

Note that the timelock is still needed for upgrades or adding new strategies which are the critical operations that involve handling of user funds.

This transaction will require going through the Timelock process. Once executed, the unpausing of the whole infrastructure will be handled by the devMultisig directly and no timelock will be required for it.

Also, option 4 is new. It was requested by the victims of the hack. 

## TL;DR
There is ~$300k left in an ibBTC multi-sig from the yields generated by assets used to mint ibBTC. These funds are user funds but the users themselves cannot be identified. This BIP proposes options for how to allocate these funds for the benefit of the DAO and its users.

## Option 1: Seed Initial eBTC Liquidity

Sell the assets and place them into a tightly bound wBTC / eBTC Uniswap v3 pool with 0.01% fees. This would be provide for great initial and perpetual liquidity, allowing for Badger to have an initial pool to swap in and out of for many users that we don’t need to incentivize with further Badger tokens. This plan assists in the vision of eBTC as a permissionless and perpetual option by providing initial liquidity without any drain on Badger emissions. Once eBTC is deployed, this option would see the LP launched by the treasury in support of eBTC.

## Option 2: Extraordinary Bootstrapping Yield for eBTC
This option would see the funds sold and then used on the launch of eBTC to provide for extraordinary yield for the launch of eBTC liquidity pools. This would provide for a bootstrapping phase for eBTC of approximately 10% APR on $3M of initial liquidity. Note that this plan would see those funds distributed in conjunction with any other sources of yield and incentives as provided for in the treasury controlled launch of the eBTC token.

## Option 3: Community Council Controlled Yield Assets

This option seeks to place the funds at the discretion of the community council with the purpose of investing and stacking more yield assets. The Community council would decide on what assets to keep and what to sell and then seek to use those yield assets across de-fi to build out a larger control of governance tokens and positions. This idea does not seek to emit the principal at all, but instead to invest the funds and then keep a portion of the earned yield to reinvest and emit a portion of the earned yield to vault depositors.

In this model, the council will attempt to adhere to the following;

1. Invest in a variety of yield bearing assets and stack them perpetually until the launch of eBTC. This may include the market purchase of Badger tokens for depositing in LPs at a rate not to exceed 50% of the total yield being generated.
2. The yield and governance stacking phase will last for 6 months to allow for an optimum investment of yield bearing assets after which time emissions will begin.
3. Once the emissions phase begins, the council will seek to emit 50% of the monthly yield to vault depositors and retain the other 50% for the stacking of more governance and yield bearing tokens.

In this option, the community council will decide on the investment of all funds but will need to draft a new BIP to decide on where emissions go once the initial 6 month period has elapsed.

## Option 4: Allocate Funds to Restitution
Badger BIP 80(a), 80(b) and 80(c) outlined the terms of restitution. BIP 80(a) voted to allocate 2mm BADGER over a 24 month period.

If this option is selected, the assets in question will be sold into BADGER and allocated to the restitution program in addition to the 2mm BADGER allocated in BIP 80(a).

Timing of the sale will be coordinated by the Badger Treasury Council to minimize slippage of the sold assets, optimize purchase price of the BADGER tokens while concluding the allocation of BADGER tokens to restitution before the restitution program is scheduled to mature.

- **DIGG / BTC Exchange Rate:** Transition to Free-Floating Exchange Rate
  - DIGG will be transitioned to a free-floating token and any peg to BTC will be driven completely by market forces.
  - All re-basing of DIGG will be stopped
  - Support for the wBTC/DIGG vault and all external LPs will end
- **remDIGG Exit Strategy:** Provide exit strategy for remDIGG holders
  - The treasury will mint enough DIGG to allow for the 1:1 exchange of remDIGG (~53) for DIGG
  - DIGG will be airdropped to remDIGG holders 1:1
  - After the airdrop, support/boost for remDIGG will end
- **DIGG Yield/Boost Strategy:** Replace DIGG emissions with extra BADGER boost
  - Stop all emissions of DIGG as yield
  - DIGG in a wallet, bDIGG in a wallet, and DIGG in a BADGER LP will count for Boost as defined below
  - remDIGG will not count for boost because it will receive a 1:1 airdrop of DIGG as explained in #2 above
  - DIGG will be valued at BTC peg for purposes of boost (# DIGG * BTC Price = DIGG Boost Value).
  - DIGG token contribution to boost will be limited to the total USD value of an addresses BADGER, remBADGER and BADGER NFT
  - Based on these changes, DIGG Boost Value = (BADGER/remBADGER/BADGER NFT Value + (# DIGG * BTC Price) up to the value of BADGER/remBADGER/BADGER NFT

A proposal by the Mechanism.Capital 13 team to create a Curve Metapool for Empty Set Dollar (ESD) and the 3Pool stablecoins (USDC, USDT, and DAI).

ESD has been one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins launched to date. Its market capitalization has grown to over $65 million in the ~2 months since its inception (peaked near $100 million).

The unique mechanism design of the protocol makes it a strong candidate to become one of the largest stable collateral assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

Creating an ESD metapool would attract more liquidity to the Curve platform and lead to increased trading fees.

Learn more about metapools here: https://resources.curve.fi/faq/base-and-metapools 1

**Abstract:**

Empty Set Dollar (ESD) is a new algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin that utilizes fixed protocol rules on supply expansion as well as a unique coupon creation + redemption model to incentivize trustless coordination between selfish participants that maintain ESD’s synthetic peg 1:1 with the US dollar all on-chain. Unlike other algorithmic stable coins like AMPL, ESD does not rebase all balances using non-standard functions, but instead adjusts supply through other mechanisms, allowing ESD to have the same composability as other standard ERC20 tokens.

Currently, crypto lacks a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoin. While DAI and sUSD come close, they currently have vulnerabilities in their architecture. The goal of ESD is to create a truly permissionless, scaleable, stable store of value, that can be used as superfluid collateral in DeFi.

Note: ESD currently only incentivizes the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool. In order to motivate more liquidity to flow to this Curve metapool, ESD holders would have to vote to upgrade ESD to incentivize this new pool. However, various ESD community members have already expressed their support for such a prospective proposal to reward Curve LPs.

*Liquidity:*

Total Uniswap Liquidity as of 11/3/2020: $1.52 million

Avg. Daily Trading Volume (Last 14 Days ended 11/3/2020): $3.75 million

*Token Holder Distribution:*

As of 11/4/2020 there are currently over 853 unique addresses holding ESD. This includes 668 staked addresses.

Over 90% of ESD tokens were staked to the DAO as of 11/3/2020.

**Motivation:**

This is an opportunity for Curve to attract more liquidity to its platform and increase trading fees. It would also benefit the ESD community by increasing the efficiency of ESD turnover and accelerating ESD contraction & expansion cycles to further stabilize the price of the token around $1. Finally, accelerating the growth of ESD would enhance the antifragility of the entire DeFi ecosystem due to ESD’s unique characteristics relative to other stable assets.

**Specification:**

This metapool would include ESD, USDC, USDT, and DAI. It is likely that the ESD protocol community would vote to incentivize this Curve metapool. It already does this for the ESD/USDC pool on Uniswap: https://emptyset.finance/#/pool/

**For:**

This pool would bring more liquidity and fees to the Curve protocol.

It would also help accelerate and dampen the volatility ESD’s expansion/contraction cycles, which are currently delayed due to the limitations of slippage on the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool.

Successful passage of this proposal would show the Curve community’s willingness to support new, innovative protocols – specifically those focused on open and permissionless access to DeFi.

**Against:**

ESD is a relatively new and experimental protocol. There are both known and unknown risks to explore as the protocol matures. These include, but are not limited to:

ESD is expected to trade within a narrow band around US$1.00, but has experienced short periods of significant volatility

A downward spiral in the instance of zero demand for new coupons (though in the current contraction period, over 26m coupons have been purchased)

Smart contract bugs (code is currently under audit); and

A design flaw that leads to an economic attack (see the recent Harvest Finance attack 1).

Abstract
The transaction fee paid by users is composed of two parts, L2 fees and L1 fees, which together include the execution cost for running the transaction on Arbitrum alongside the cost of posting data to Ethereum (to learn more about this, read the deep dive on the subject 1).

Historically, the rollup fee market has been dominated by the L1 cost component. With the Dencun upgrade soon being enabled on Ethereum, the current pricing structure may no longer be optimal. The ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade is a step towards better consuming the new data availability affordances offered by Ethereum, but will also potentially require further adjustment once EIP-4844 has been deployed and tested.

There was an oversight during the ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade where two configuration should be updated for users when the Dencun upgrade occurs:

L1 surplus fee. Reduce the surplus fee per byte from 32 gwei to 0.
L2 base fee. Reduce the minimum from 0.1 gwei to 0.01 gwei.
In both cases, the configuration changes will match what is currently implemented in Arbitrum Nova. As evidenced by the recent surge of transactions in Arbitrum Nova, the network can handle the increased transaction throughput while offering lower fees for users in general under that configuration.

Impact on the ArbitrumDAO’s revenue
The L2 base fee change will impact the revenue received by the ArbitrumDAO. The potential impact based on the past 30 days of activity was calculated, which if the changes had been implemented (ignoring potential changes in demand based on lower fees), would have resulted in overall profit going from 816.13 ETH → 79.89 ETH

While the fee reduction will result in lower revenue for the ArbitrumDAO in the short term, it will ensure that the Arbitrum One network continues to offer competitive costs to its users and in turn it can lead to an increase in transaction traffic.

Since the parameter change affects the revenue generated, it is important to carry out a temperature check for the ArbitrumDAO to discuss and ultimately vote on the change. If it is approved by the ArbitrumDAO, then the Security Council will be requested to initiate a non-emergency action to execute the configuration change. The goal is to ensure the fees are changed as soon as possible in line with the Decun upgrade.

Implementation details
The following configured values will be changed in the ArbOwner smart contract that can be viewed in Contract Address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006b | Arbiscan.

The following governance action smart contracts will be used to initiate the action:

ArbOneSetAtlasL1PricingRewardAction | Address 0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d | Arbiscan
ArbOneSetAtlasMinBaseFeeAction | Address 0x849E360a247132F961c9CBE95Ba39106c72e1268 | Arbiscan
The security council will separate the two parameter change actions to enable the ArbitrumDAO to decide whether to accept one, both, or neither. The ability to decide will be reflected on Snapshot using a ranked voting with the following options:

Set L1 surplus fee and L2 minimum base fee.
Set only L1 surplus fee.
Set only L2 minimum base fee.
Set neither option and cancel security council action.
Timeline
The ArbOS v20 “Atlas” upgrade is due to be activated on the 14th of March, and the following schedule will be pursued to address the configuration issues in a timely manner:

5th March - Temperature Vote on Snapshot
5th March - Initiate non-emergency security council action
18th March - Activate configuration change to reduce fees
A non-emergency security council action is viewed as ideal as it exists primarily to approve and implement routine software upgrades, routine maintenance and other parameter adjustments in a non-emergency setting.

Temperature check: Snapshot 3
Security council transaction: [update shortly]

Taking this route will mean that Arbitrum One network will have higher than anticipated fees for 5 days.

The following governance calls will also enable the community to discuss the technical changes:

6th March - Wednesday at 6pm EST
7th March - Thursday at 9am EST
Both calls will be added to the governance call and more calls can be arranged if necessary.",bullish,1.9659,2024-03-05 16:31:56+00:00,2.1481,2.1481,2024-03-06 00:00:00+00:00,9.26801973650744,2.10915,0.0728673889821454,0.8352206349372864,True," The text discusses a proposed adjustment in transaction fees on the Arbitrum network, due to an upcoming Ethereum upgrade (Dencun). The changes aim to optimize costs for users by reducing L1 surplus fee per byte and L2 base fee minimum. This could potentially impact the revenue of the ArbitrumDAO but is seen as necessary to maintain competitive fees and increase transaction traffic. A temperature check vote will be conducted on Snapshot, followed by a non-emergency Security Council action to execute the configuration change. The adjustments may temporarily result in higher than anticipated fees for 5 days. Additional governance calls are planned for community discussion.",bullish,small

Multiple security proposals are being introduced piecemeal; the Arbitrum DAO should not rush into anything but work together on an inclusive RFP framework.

## Introduction
The security of smart contracts is of utmost importance in the Arbitrum ecosystem. To ensure the highest level of security, we propose implementing an RFP structure for smart contract security auditors. This proposal aims to establish a process for onboarding security service providers and then selecting them on a per-project basis in a transparent, fair, and efficient manner. The process will be open to all security engineers, researchers, and organizations.

## Proposal
The Arbitrum DAO shall issue an RFP for security services. The RFP will outline the requirements for security professionals, including their experience, qualifications, and methodology. The RFP will also specify the scope of the security services needed, the timeline, and the compensation rates for various project categories. [RFP Details TBD]

## Selection Process
The selection process will be based on the following criteria:

Experience and Qualifications: Security researchers must have a proven track record of conducting smart contract security audits and/or tooling development. They must have experience with the Arbitrum ecosystem and be familiar with its unique features.

Methodology: Security researchers must have a rigorous audit and tooling SDLC methodology. They must be able to identify vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation.

Price: Auditors must provide a competitive price for their services. [Standarized Metrics for rates TBD]

The selection process will be overseen by a committee of experts appointed by the Arbitrum DAO. The committee will review the proposals submitted by auditors and select the most qualified candidate based on the abovementioned criteria.

## A Call to Action
Implementing an RFP structure for security services will ensure the Arbitrum ecosystem remains secure and resilient. By establishing a transparent and fair service provider onboarding and project selection process, we can attract the best professionals and ensure they are compensated fairly for their services. We urge the Arbitrum DAO to consider this proposal and participate in the conversation, as the current state of the proposals is unmanageable, rushed, and exclusive.

### Voting
For: Yes, invite security orgs to collaborate with the DAO on a RFP.
Against: No, each security org should create its own proposal.

129,217,477,477,477,2024-05-22 21:20:20+00:00,arbitrum,"## Abstract
This proposal aims to streamline the LTIPP bounty process by allowing the LTIPP council more autonomy in choosing who completes each bounty. This will help create a faster-moving selection system with more accountability, allowing the DAO to gather more insights into the results of the incentive campaigns.
## Motivation
The LTIPP proposal included up to 200,000 ARB available for research on STIP, the Backfund, and the LTIP Pilot Program. The bounties guarantee the DAO will have multiple teams working on providing meaningful conclusions regarding the incentive programs. These conclusions will be essential to allow the DAO to possess all the information necessary to create the best possible long-term incentive framework.
However, in its current format, it will take multiple months and many DAO votes to decide who will complete each bounty. This proposal aims to streamline that process so that more teams can research Arbitrum Incentives programs in a timely manner. By allowing the LTIPP council more freedom in using the bounty funds, we can move faster to start the bounties the same week as the start incentives.
## Rationale
This new process not only speeds things up but also creates more accountability and can lead to more teams applying to fulfill bounties.
DAO-wide votes to select who completes each bounty can become a popularity contest. This discourages less well-connected or busy researchers from applying, as they don’t want to deal with the struggle of lobbying every delegate.
However, allowing the elected LTIPP council to choose the most qualified teams without the researchers worrying about lobbying and DAO politics will encourage more bounty applications. This will lead to more options to choose from and result in better overall research being done.
This new process for selecting bounties also adds accountability, as the decision is made by a small group instead of the entire DAO. The DAO delegates might not want to take the time or have the expertise to read and understand each application. Additionally, it is hard to assign accountability for decisions when they are made by large groups like DAOs.
However, with a smaller group making the decisions, more accountability and expertise will be placed in each decision, leading to better outcomes for the DAO. The LTIPP council comprises strong teams and individuals elected by the community who have the DAOs’ best interests in mind. The council has intimate knowledge of the incentives programs and understands what needs to be studied to create a new and improved incentives program.
## Specifications
The LTIPP proposal allocated a maximum of 200k ARB for research bounties. To streamline the process, this proposal allows the council to choose who fulfills each bounty. The proposed new bounty format is as follows.
#### Bounty Submission
Starting May 20th, researchers can apply for bounties by submitting applications on the forum. The council will put out a list of bounties they would like researched but researchers can also submit their own ideas for bounties.
####  Bounty Feedback
Applications for research bounties will be due June 3rd. The council and delegates will give feedback on the forum up until the 3rd to give feedback and allow people to alter their applications.
#### Bounty Selection
The LTIPP council will then select which bounties to fund on June 10th. Researchers whose bounty is selected would start their research immediately upon selection. This will align nicely with the start of LTIPP incentives beginning on June 3rd.
#### Bounty Payments
Researchers will be paid half of their bounty upon completing KYC and half of it upon completing their bounty. The LTIPP workstream will monitor the bounties throughout the program to ensure the bounties are completed and payments are made.
## Steps to Implement
* Complete Snapshot vote to give more autonomy to the LTIPP council.
* Have teams submit proposals for bounties
* The council selects which bounties to fund
* Research starts
* Researcher’s selected for bounties complete KYC
* Half of the bounty is paid once KYC is completed
* Half of the bounty is paid upon completion of the research
## Timeline
* Snapshot Vote: May 22 - May 29th
* Application Period: May 22 - June 3rd
* Selection Period: June 3rd - June 10th
* Research: June 10th - September
## Overall Cost
There is no additional cost to this proposal. The funding will come from the 200K arb budget from the LTIPP proposal.",bullish,1.1413,2024-05-22 21:20:20+00:00,1.26,1.26,2024-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,10.40042057303075,1.1805,0.0343467975116094,0.8276170790195465,True," This text presents a proposal aimed at streamlining the bounty process within the LTIPP council, allowing them more autonomy in selecting who completes each bounty. The motivation is to expedite research on Arbitrum Incentives programs and gather valuable insights for creating an optimal long-term incentive framework.

The rationale behind this proposal includes fostering speed, accountability, and encouraging more applications by reducing the need for lobbying and DAO politics. By delegating decision-making to a smaller group (the LTIPP council), it is expected that better outcomes will be achieved for the DAO due to increased expertise and accountability.

The new process involves researchers submitting bounty applications, feedback on applications, selection of funded bounties, and payments upon completion of KYC and research. The timeline includes a snapshot vote, application period, selection period, research phase, and a research period lasting from June to September. No additional costs are associated with this proposal as the funding will come from the LTIPP budget.",bullish,medium

### Submitted by: Lemma Ltd

### Abstract
This document (“**AIP-1**”) proposes the structure of a decentralized autonomous organization called the ArbitrumDAO that would be governed by holders of $ARB, the decentralized token that will serve as the primary token for fostering, developing, authorizing and/or governing the ArbitrumDAO-approved chains (as defined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution). The ArbitrumDAO Constitution, located at https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution is incorporated herein by reference.

### Motivation

The Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company, which will serve the ArbitrumDAO community and be governed by it, aims to foster the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

The ArbitrumDAO will have the ability to submit Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (“**AIPs**”), vote on them and make them a reality through The Arbitrum Foundation.

The guiding values of The Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO are described in Section 5 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution and are incorporated herein.

### Rationale

The Arbitrum Foundation serves the ArbitrumDAO by administering the wishes of the community and otherwise adhering to its guiding values. The Arbitrum Foundation and DAO governance are intended to serve as vehicles enabling impactful, transparent and fair decentralized governance by the broader Arbitrum community.

Through the submission of AIPs, the ArbitrumDAO will be able to collectively decide and effectuate changes ranging from core protocol technology to non-technical decisions that otherwise impact the community and $ARB tokenholders.


### Specifications

**Governance powers breakdown**

**1. $ARB Tokenholders**

* $ARB tokenholders, who make up the ArbitrumDAO, play the most critical role in the proper functioning of decentralized governance in the pursuit of a trustless, transparent and verifiable Arbitrum ecosystem. As Arbitrum is intended to be a public good, it is only right that governance over it should be governed by those for whom such public good is intended for.

* $ARB tokenholders have the ability to directly propose, vote on and effectuate on-chain AIPs with respect to the ArbitrumDAO-approved chains.


**2. Special Grants**

* The Arbitrum Foundation shall be permitted to issue grants out of the Administrative Budget Wallet without undergoing a full on-chain AIP process (such grants, “**Special Grants**”).

* The rationale behind the ability of The Arbitrum Foundation to issue Special Grants is to avoid inundating governance with grant applications, while at the same time alleviating voter fatigue.

* The Special Grants application process and criteria will be released at a later date by The Arbitrum Foundation.


**3. Directors**

As a Cayman Islands foundation, The Arbitrum Foundation is required to have at least 1 director responsible for the management and operation of The Arbitrum Foundation, in particular approving and entering into contractual arrangements on behalf of The Arbitrum Foundation (i.e., the parties actually approving and signing agreements).|

The directors are responsible for ensuring that AIPs do not:

* Compromise their fiduciary duties owed to The Arbitrum Foundation;
* Violate The Arbitrum Foundation’s Amended & Restated Memorandum of Association or bylaws, the ArbitrumDAO Constitution, the AIP Process or any other laws or regulations of applicable jurisdictions (including but not limited to Cayman Islands laws); and 
* Cause The Arbitrum Foundation to be in breach or violation of any contracts, agreements or any other arrangements.

The initial directors of The Arbitrum Foundation are: 
* Campbell Law, 
* Edward Noyons and 
* Ani Banerjee

The ArbitrumDAO may remove or elect The Arbitrum Foundation’s directors or expand or reduce the number of directors at any time pursuant to a Non-Constitutional AIP

**4.	Security Council**
The Security Council is a committee of 12 members of a multi-sig wallet which has the ability to perform both Emergency and Non-Emergency Actions, which are further detailed in Section 3 of the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), which is incorporated herein by reference.

Security Council Elections:
Section 4 of the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) describes the Security Council election process and is incorporated herein by reference.

**5. Data Availability Committee (Arbitrum Nova chain only)**

Transactions occurring on the Arbitrum Nova chain are settled on Ethereum mainnet, but, unlike transactions occurring on the Arbitrum One chain, the underlying transaction data batches are posted and stored by the members of the Data Availability Committee on a [Data Availability Server](https://developer.arbitrum.io/das/daserver-instructions) (and not on Ethereum mainnet).

The initial members of the Data Availability Committee are authorized representatives of the following parties:
* Reddit, Inc.
* ConsenSys Software Inc.
* QuikNode, Inc.
* P2P Business Technologies
* Google Cloud ( Google LLC.)
* Offchain Labs, Inc.
* Opensea Innovation Labs Private Limited


Data Availability Committee members can be appointed and removed at any time pursuant to a Constitutional AIP approved by the ArbitrumDAO. In the event that a Data Availability Committee member is removed (and not otherwise replaced) pursuant to a Constitutional AIP approved by the ArbitrumDAO, or in the event that a Data Availability Committee member resigns without a replacement, the Security Council may execute an emergency action (9-of-12 approval required) to appoint a replacement for such removed or resigned Data Availability Committee member.

### AIP Guidelines and Process Breakdown

Section 2 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution lays out the AIP process and voting procedures, as well as the various categories of AIPs, and is incorporated herein.

**Arbitrum Voting Protocol Procedure**

1. [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) will act as the initial on-chain voting platform for the ArbitrumDAO to submit and vote on AIPs

2. Tally will serve as a front-end user interface that allows DAO members to do several things, namely:
*   Create AIPs;
*   View delegates and their voting share;
*   Re-delegate votes to a different delegate;
*   View current and past AIPs;
*   Vote on AIPs on-chain, interacting with the on-chain governance contracts via the Tally front-end; and
*   View the status of AIP execution during all voting stages

Abstract
TLDR: This proposal funds a coalition led by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits in order to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 12 months.

The Arbitrum Coalition is an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.

Motivation
The Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition’s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.

The Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.

As a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO’s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.

Had the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it’s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.

Additionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.

The Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal’s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.

An example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.

The Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.

Rationale
One key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.

Arbitrum’s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can’t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.

Additionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.

Other DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.

Two additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.

The Coalition’s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.

Introduction to The Coalition
Trail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world’s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They’ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.

Gauntlet: Gauntlet 3’s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi’s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.

Blockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.

Key Terms
The Arbitrum Coalition (“the Coalition”): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.

DAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition’s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO’s best interests are met by the Coalition.

Coalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO’s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through
a Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.

Coalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.

Specifications
The advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO’s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO’s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.

The roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:

Trail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, … ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, …)

Gauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.

Blockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.

The Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO’s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.

We believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.

Projects
The Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority

Forum Proposal Review [BWR]
Will provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.
Review on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]
White box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties
Reviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)
Just-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]
Gauntlet’s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.
Arbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]
A public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.
Service Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]
Establish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.
The framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.
Following the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.
Project Management [BWR]
Will handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.
Once the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition’s work.

Tooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]

Develop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:
Specific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.
Develop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant
Visualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,
Visualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.
Educational material [Trail of Bits]

Provide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough
Research New Mechanisms [BWR]

Objectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.
Delegate Engagement [BWR]

Will create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.
Growth Initiatives [BWR]

Will produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research’s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition’s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Costs
The total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following ¾ starting 91 days from the AIP’s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal.

Please review the proposal forum post for a full proposal description: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-unlock-arb-utility-and-align-governance/25084/1
 
### Abstract

We propose the development of an ArbitrumDAO Governance Analytics Dashboard to support ongoing governance initiatives, enhance transparency, and provide comprehensive insights into governance data. The dashboard aims to track voting behavior, safeguard against potential governance attacks, and measure the success of initiatives like Redelegation Week. We are seeking comments and support from the Arbitrum community to develop this analytic dashboard.

### Motivation

The Arbitrum community needs a robust, user-friendly tool to simplify the understanding of complex governance dynamics, track the effectiveness of initiatives, and ensure transparency and accountability. This dashboard will foster inclusive, data-driven decision-making, enhancing community governance effectiveness.

**Differentiation from Existing Solutions:**

Our Arbitrum Governance Analytics Dashboard aims to fill the gaps in existing platforms by providing more detailed metrics for enhanced understanding and transparency:

**1. Concentration of Voting Power Metrics**: Our dashboard sheds light on the distribution of voting power among small and large holders, their engagement in delegation, and the source of delegates’ voting power. It identifies potential centralization of power and offers insights into each delegate’s influence.

**2. Proposal Metrics**: We offer a detailed view of proposal activities, including the ratio of unique proposers to total proposals and the distribution by type. We classify proposal results as contentious, generally accepted, or normal to help stakeholders understand voting dynamics.

**3. Participation Metrics**: Our focus is on delivering granular metrics on the participation of small and large holders. This comprehensive analysis identifies underrepresented groups and informs strategies for more balanced and inclusive participation.

Our dashboard is an analytical tool designed to provide a comprehensive view of Arbitrum’s governance process, highlighting underrepresented holders or delegates and the overall power structure. We are committed to iterative development, refining our dashboard based on community feedback to ensure it remains valuable and relevant for all stakeholders.

### Rationale

This proposal aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values by enhancing transparency, promoting data-driven decision-making, and supporting the effectiveness of governance processes. By providing near real-time monitoring and detailed analytics, the dashboard will help the community make informed decisions and maintain a secure governance framework.

### Example Uses of the Dashboard

1. Redelegation Week Success Tracking

To ensure the success of the Redelegation Week program, our dashboard will monitor delegate change in their voting power and track the overall votable supply.This user-friendly interface will display the number of delegates joining and the increase in delegations, providing clear insights into the program's success.

2. Optimizing Voting Schedule

Our dashboard will help optimize the voting schedule by identifying periods when delegates are most active. By aligning voting schedules with peak voting activity, we can support the predictability proposal from Entropy, adjusting dates based on these insights to enhance participation and predictability.

3. Safeguarding from Potential Governance Attacks

To safeguard against potential governance attacks, our dashboard will help monitor unusual delegation behavior, such as sudden changes in delegate voting power into their respective delegate’s voting activity for certain proposals, helping to maintain a secure and robust governance framework.

4. Supporting Tools for Current and Future Delegate Incentive Programs

Our dashboard will complement the auditing of the Delegate Incentive program's results. By providing comprehensive analytics and near real-time delegate participation tracking, it ensures transparency and accountability, allowing for accurate assessment and evaluation of the program's effectiveness.

### Steps to Implement

**1. Research & Ideation:**

* We started by identifying the metrics and gather community feedbacks

**2. Design & Mockups:**

* Based on our research, we created initial design mockups focusing on user experience and the presentation of key metrics. These were shared with the community for initial feedback.

**3. Development Phase 1:**

* We developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) featuring basic holder metrics and concentration of voting power metrics. This was released as a mid-development preview to gather community feedback.

**4. Development Phase 2:**

* We integrated additional metrics based on community feedback, including more detailed proposal and participation metrics.

**5. Testing & Iteration:**

* The dashboard underwent multiple rounds of testing for functionality, usability, and data accuracy. We also made iterative improvements based on ongoing community feedback.

**6. Launch & Maintenance:**

* After final testing and refinements, the dashboard was officially launched. We have committed to maintaining it, including daily updates and feature iterations based on community needs.

**7. Monthly Report:**

* Release of monthly governance analytics report

136,240,508,508,508,2023-09-11 03:58:28+00:00,arbitrum,"Note: This proposal has been posted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*

**Abstract**
This proposal outlines a one-time, community-created program to distribute up to 75,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through the January 31, 2024. It asks all participating grantees to self report data, and dashboards, summarizing grant performance.

**Motivation**
This provisional framework aims to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed (1 19, 2 7, 3 4, 4 5).
The goals of the program are to:
•	Support Network Growth: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.
•	Experiment with Incentive Grants: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.
•	Find new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.
•	Create Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.

**Rationale**
By incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.

Given that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.

**Specifications**
The Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 75,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.

**Steps to Implement**
 
![8b05a5d34faf8659a144f1d35081a89ae83e237e.png](ipfs://bafkreiaizvrpzwo5bn6lxl5ikdywhfakyphtdukgkywpuzpvlrokaaj2oe)
     
Following a successful Snapshot Temperature Check, the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.

The Snapshot Temperature Check will be designed to both achieve consensus and approve funding across four options, where each vote will distinguish support of up to X ARB through the end of January 31, 2024:
•	For up to **25M ARB** through January 31, 2024.
•	For up to **50M ARB** through January 31, 2024.
•	For up to **75M ARB** through January 31, 2024.
•	Against.

**Financial Proposal**
The Financial Proposal will comprise the following:
•	A ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and application template 37 as articulated in this document.
•	Approval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.
•	A 25,000,000, 50,000,000 or 75,000,000 ARB distribution to the program Multisig.
•	A 32,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.
o	20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:
	Draft and review of multiple iterations of incentive proposals.
	Moderation of community calls and working group telegram.
	Coordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.
o	12,000 ARB Multisig Signers (A new version of the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig 17 - 2K per signer).

**Multisig Setup**
A new multisig will be created with the signers from the original pl-ARB multisig, under the name of the Arbitrum DAO. The new multisig will include two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:

1.	Clawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.
2.	Streaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.

**What are the Eligibility Requirements?**

Grant Requirements:
•	Grantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.
•	Grantees must not farm their own incentive programs.
•	Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.
•	Grantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard or alternatively in a report.
•	Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.
•	Grantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.
•	Grantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.
•	Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.
•	Grantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.
•	Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.
•	Grantees must apply using the approved program application template 15.

By streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:

•	Any use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.
•	Failure to comply with data reporting standards.
o	Grantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.
•	•	Dashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.
•	•	More granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.
o	If dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.
In that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.

**Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines**
Grants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.
Protocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there’s no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.
As such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:

•	**Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)**
o	Recommendations:
	Live on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.
	Meets one of the following criteria:
	.> $1.5M TVL.
	.>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.

•	**Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)**
o	Recommendations:
	Live on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.
	Meets one of the following criteria:
	.> $4M TVL.
	.>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.

•	**Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)**
o	Recommendations:
	Live on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.
	Meets one of the following criteria:
	.> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.
	.> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.

•	**Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)**
o	Recommendations:
	Live on Arbitrum for at least 12 months
	Meets one of the following criteria
	.> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL
	.> $200M 30D cumulative volume

*Grants greater than $1M ARB will be asked to include milestone-based funding tranches in their application.

One could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.

**Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?**
Grants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.

Cycle 1
1.	Application Period (1 Week):
During the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the “Incentive Grant Applications” Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application Template 20.
Once posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.

2.	Review Period (1 Week):
Delegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.
Applicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.

3.	Voting Period (1 Week):
A delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.
To succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the PL-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.

Cycle 2
Repeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.

**Overall Cost**
Up to 75,032,000 ARB.

**Outstanding Questions and Concerns**

What happens if the budget is exceeded?
We do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 75M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.

What will happen to excess funds?
Following Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.

What is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?
The Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of allowing incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.
At the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.

What are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?
•	Community Support: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.
•	Network Activity: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.
•	Community Awareness: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.
•	Incentives Data: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.

## Abstract

This post proposes granting 1.5M ARB per month to Camelot DAO for the next 6 months to fund liquidity incentives for Arbitrum-focused projects on Camelot, including the onboarding of new and multi-chain protocols entering the ecosystem. Camelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to enable sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols. This proposal will therefore support deeper spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders, as well as supporting integration partners and the launch of new protocols, thereby enabling significant growth through an approach that prioritizes Arbitrum’s core values. Most importantly, this will further the adoption of ARB as a base asset within liquidity pools and partner integrations.

...

## Motivation

Camelot is not just a DEX - it’s the infrastructure that enables native protocols to build sustainable and efficient liquidity. As Arbitrum’s first major native DEX, Camelot strives to support the ecosystem with a long-term and collaborative approach that moves beyond the traditional role of DEXs as simple ‘yield farms’.

In just over 6 months of being live, Camelot has achieved over $2,500,000,000 total volume traded, highs of $100m TVL, and the successful onboarding of countless protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Round Table is the hub for Camelot’s official long-term partners, and the initial members consisted of the core Arbitrum protocols such as Vela, Jones, Pendle, Plutus, GMX, Sperax, and more. On average, Round Table partners have over 90% of their total DEX liquidity and volume on Camelot.

Since then, the Round Table now consists of over 25 official partner protocols, and through its launchpad Camelot has supported over 9 protocols to raise funds in a community-focused and decentralized way. Most importantly, Camelot is home to numerous community builders that leverage the custom-built features to manage their liquidity, with a combined reach of over 40 native protocols present on Camelot and over 15 integrations being built on top of its infrastructure. Camelot is one of the most used dapps in the ecosystem, with over 300,000 unique users since launch. Camelot is not a fork, and is custom-built code that has been thoroughly tested and audited by Paladin. In addition, Camelot has no private investors and was launched in a truly community-focused and decentralized way. The ownership of Camelot has been spread through the key Arbitrum players, thereby making the protocol truly part of the ecosystem and community.

This grant would have a significant impact on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem in several ways:

* Deep spot liquidity is the foundation for DeFi protocols to thrive, enabling further innovation and use cases for Arbitrum native protocols. For example, deeper spot liquidity unlocks the potential for tokens to be used in lending markets, options and perps protocols, structured products, and much more. Whilst other DEXs also tackle this for blue chip tokens, Camelot is uniquely positioned to most effectively support the native ecosystem builders. This proposal will specifically focus on Arbitrum protocols throughout their lifecycle, whilst leveraging the network and community of Camelot to generate sustainable growth with real users. Deepening pools that already have significant liquidity is not our only focus, as Camelot is positioned to ensure the distribution of ARB tokens materializes into a stronger ecosystem. Most importantly, Camelot can work with partners to pair their tokens with ARB as a base asset. This will advance ARB as a foundational asset of the ecosystem, providing it with direct value and utility.

* Camelot has a proven track record of effectively allocating rewards in a sustainable and economical way. Therefore, not only will this grant proposal deepen liquidity, it will also ensure that the most active and aligned builders on Arbitrum directly benefit from it too. As an ecosystem hub for native builders, Camelot will leverage this grant to support and incentivise new protocols launching in the ecosystem, further cementing Arbitrum’s position as the go-to layer 2 for innovation and DeFi. Through its launchpad and network of Round Table partners, Camelot additionally offers protocols marketing, BD, and general support.

* In addition to liquidity, Camelot is one of the largest Arbitrum governance delegates and has continued to foster collaboration in the ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal would also focus on integration partners that enable more efficient liquidity management and further use cases. These protocols also build on top of our partner liquidity pools, therefore multiplying the network effects of the allocated Arb incentives. Camelot currently has over 15 integration partners, ranging from advanced liquidity management apps, leveraged yield farming, derivatives, structured products, and more.

...

## Rationale

Camelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum’s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.

Since its inception in December 2022, Camelot has maintained a robust upward trajectory, steered by a long-term, sustainable incentives approach. We've avoided the common pitfalls of being a ‘yield-farm for mercenary capital,’ and our proven track record of allocating incentives effectively to yield maximum returns for our community, protocol, and ecosystem stands testament to our potential. We plan to harness the power of Arbitrum grant incentives to maintain this growth trajectory.

Though past performance doesn't necessarily predict future success, it does offer valuable insights into the potential of this proposal. Over the period from December 2022 to May 2023, Camelot experienced an impressive average monthly increase in volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) of 275% and 79% respectively. Even more noteworthy is that during this period, Camelot generated over $10m in protocol fees, with a significant proportion of these channelled back to our token holders. This strongly suggests that, with the additional Arbitrum incentives, we can stimulate significant growth and capture substantial long-term value across a large number of native protocols. Moreover, we can achieve this while ensuring a decentralized and sustainable token ownership distribution. Camelot also received an airdrop of over 2,000,000 ARB, which has so far been fully dedicated to being an active governance participant.

To allocate the Arbitrum incentives even more effectively we will distribute it across 4 different categories: Ecosystem Builders, Integration Partners, Core Pairs, and Liquid Staking Derivatives.

![image](ipfs://bafkreicjatrrpsk2u22lkmiqwklpmnk5jqkacc45odyf7npqib3hrgydse)    

### Ecosystem Builders

Camelot is home to many of Arbitrum’s favourite protocols, and this category will distribute incentives to builders that are fully aligned with Camelot’s approach to sustainable liquidity and long-term collaboration. As detailed in the ‘Specifications’ section below, Camelot is one of the most effective hubs to distribute incentives, due to the large and expansive network of long-term partners.

### Integration Partners

By providing incentives to partners that are building on top of Camelot’s infrastructure, we are diversifying the use of incentives to fuel even further innovation and growth that benefits all partners and the broader ecosystem, whilst also deepening the underlying liquidity at the same time. These partners would include concentrated liquidity managers, leveraged yield protocols, lending markets, liquidity management dapps and more.

### Core pairs

Whilst Camelot’s primary focus is on the native Arbitrum builders, ensuring Camelot can offer deep liquidity for the most actively traded tokens like ETH and USDC is also important as the native DEX. With the number of protocols actively building on Camelot, deep liquidity for core pairs will be an important piece to ensure we have a strong foundation that can expand to longer-tail tokens too.

### Liquid staked derivatives

Liquid staked derivatives are seeing rapid growth as they unlock significant liquidity on Ethereum whilst securing the network at the same time. The majority of LSD liquidity is currently on Ethereum, and we think it’s an important catalyst for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem to support LSD adoption natively too. Deeper LSD liquidity will allow Arbitrum native builders to tap into a highly productive asset to build on top of, leading to further growth, utility, and products for the ecosystem.

### Velodrome on Optimism as Precedent

While Arbitrum is a unique ecosystem which is difficult to compare to other networks, the effect of Optimism’s grant to Velodrome in July of 2022 supports that a similar grant to Camelot could have a positive effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Velodrome received a 3M OP grant from the Optimism Foundation in July of 2022 that was meant to last 4-5 months. As seen in the visual below, Velodrome had around $14M in TVL, generated around $3.3k in weekly fees, and had $2M in daily volume before the grant. In the last 3 months, Camelot has averaged over $80M in TVL, $450,000 in weekly fees, and $18M in daily volume. While TVL and volume numbers can be skewed by low fee-generating mercenary TVL, fees paid are less biased, and Camelot has been earning over 100x more fees than Velodrome before incentives.

Camelot has surpassed Velodrome by nearly every metric by using novel, long-term emission incentives. Thus, we’re asking for 1.5M ARB per month vs Velodrome’s 3M OP over 4-5 months. Because Camelot is currently in a much better position than pre-grant Velodrome, we expect that the ARB grant will increase liquidity depth on Camelot and the general ecosystem expansion even more, supercharging the network to a new level.

To provide additional perspective, the Arbitrum DAO treasury currently holds 3,527,046,084 ARB tokens. Assuming a hypothetical 10-year runway of treasury spending, this would be equivalent to 352m ARB tokens a year. Camelot’s grant proposal for a total of 9m ARB tokens would therefore represent 2.56% of the annual budget, with the expectation of significant ecosystem growth and expansion.

## Specifications

Camelot will distribute 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month as incentives across a broad range of Arbitrum liquidity pools and integrations. The distribution of these incentives will adhere to the Proposal Objectives, the proposal parameters, and the Transparency Report. 

The transparency report will ensure that Camelot has clearly documented where every $ARB token has been allocated, the relevant growth metrics achieved, and most importantly the progress for its broader Arbitrum objectives. You can see the objectives and parameters below and a template of the transparency report attached. This report will be provided at the latest 72 hrs before the following month’s incentives are to be distributed.

### Proposal Objectives
*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*

* To grow the liquidity of Arbitrum builders, bringing new users into the ecosystem and directly supporting the growth of ecosystem protocols
* To use the incentives to bring new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem
* To support the launch of native builders and their liquidity requirements
* To advance the adoption of ARB as a base asset in liquidity pools
* To advance the adoption of ARB within integration partner strategies
* To provide marketing and community support to the ecosystem builders included in the incentive programme

### Proposal Parameters
*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*

* Incentives will be distributed to a minimum of 30 partner pools, as documented in the transparency report. Any new pool or integration needs to be clearly documented beforehand in the transparency report.
* No single pool or partner (excluding core $ARB pools) can receive more than 5% of the total incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)
* No single pool or integration partner can receive more than 5% of its TVL in monthly incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)
* A pool must maintain a minimum trading volume of $1,000,000 annualized to be valid to receive rewards (as measured over a 30-day period).
* A minimum of 33% of the total incentives will be used on liquidity pools with $ARB as the base asset. On top of this minimum, Camelot will provide bonus incentives to teams that actively transition their liquidity to ARB as a base asset too. This will be included and measured within the aforementioned transparency report.
* The partner integration section has now been merged into the “Ecosystem Builders” section, with the relevant parameters above being applicable.
* If at any point the Arbitrum community or DAO is not satisfied with the performance or delivery, they can move forward with a governance vote to end the grant early.

Camelot will distribute the incentives across the following categories and pools detailed below. The distribution across these various pools will adhere to the Proposal Objectives and parameters, please reference the transparency report for a more in-depth breakdown:

[TRANSPARENCY REPORT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing)
 
![image](ipfs://bafkreifbxdwctnf335rkwqpw7k5dejulbgc3wbcmjxew45pkxxttyamhrq)

* Ecosystem Builders 75%
  * Liquidity incentives for partner pools such as Vela, Pendle, Plutus, Jones and a diverse range of Arbitrum protocols. This will include integration partners that build on top of Camelot liquidity pools, such as Gamma and DeFi Edge, following the same parameters and guidelines shared above.
  * The transparency report contains a broader breakdown of the ecosystem pools that this will be focused on. In addition, these incentives will be used to encourage the adoption of ARB as a base asset for ecosystem protocol liquidity pools.

* Core Pairs 15%
  * These represent the core liquidity pools such as ARB/ETH, ETH/USDC, and USDC/USDC. Further examples are included in the transparency report.

* Liquid Staking Derivatives 10%
  * Focusing on a diverse range of LSDs, most of which have little liquidity on Arbitrum. This will therefore target protocols such as unshETH, Lido, Rocket Pool, Swell, Stafi and more.

Camelot will utilize its Nitro Pools technology to release the granted ARB in combination with $GRAIL and $xGRAIL emissions to liquidity providers. Nitro Pools are custom-built permissionless solutions to distribute incentives to any liquidity pool, with the ability to add custom requirements also. Along with the rest of the protocol, Nitro Pools have been audited by Paladin, and used by Camelot and numerous partners over the previous 8 months.


...

## Steps to implement

Camelot will receive 1,5000,000 monthly over a period of 6 months, for a total of 9m ARB. In order to most transparently receive the tokens requested, Camelot will use a new multisig that will have several ecosystem players from other Arbitrum protocols. The makeup of this multisig, including the protocol affiliation(s) of each signer will be made public upon the creation of the multisig (before the proposal is moved to snapshot), and all changes to the makeup of the multisig will be announced in advance. This multisig will be governed by a multisig participation agreement wherein each signer will agree to use their signing authority only to further the interest of the wallet itself, using the ARB tokens to incentivise liquidity in approved nitro pools. By structuring the multi-sig with signers representative of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, Camelot will ensure that the ARB tokens granted by the Arbitrum DAO will be leveraged to support new protocols, DAOs, and projects that are broadly value additive for Arbitrum.

Camelot currently has [2,189,094 ARB tokens](https://debank.com/profile/0x03ff2d78afb69e0859ec6beb4cf107d3741e97ab) in its treasury, which it has used entirely for governance purposes. As an additional safeguard and sign of assurance, Camelot commits to placing its own ARB into the grant multisig for the duration of the 6 month proposal, therefore at any given time, Camelot will have “guaranteed” more ARB than it would receive from the Arbitrum DAO. Once the grant is over, Camelot will receive its own 2,189,094 ARB tokens back.

Once the ARB tokens have been distributed to the intended multisig wallet, Camelot will bear the full responsibility and workload to ensure the effective allocation of these tokens. Camelot will actively manage and continuously analyze the effectiveness of the incentives being used, following the aforementioned proposal objectives and parameters, and clearly documenting any changes or adjustments in the transparency report.

More information on the mechanics of Camelot’s nitro pools is available [here](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/nitro-pools). Once the ARB tokens have been distributed to the grant multisig, Camelot will then further distribute them to internal wallets where the tokens will be used as incentives for the pools and partner integrations mentioned above under ‘Specifications’.

* Camelot will receive 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month for 6 months, which it will distribute in accordance to the proposal objectives and parameters.
* Camelot will detail how every ARB token is allocated and the progress towards the proposal objectives within the [transparency report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing).
* The transparency report will be shared no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are distributed.
* Camelot will hold a bi-weekly public community call to discuss the performance and progress of the grant and the transparency report in further detail.

...

## Timeline

Camelot will begin the grant distribution from the date this proposal is passed and the ARB is delivered until 6 months after. The 1.5M ARB will be distributed monthly to the relevant ecosystem multisig mentioned above, for a total of 6 months.

Once the grant is active, Camelot will provide the subsequent transparency reports no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are to be distributed. The transparency report will follow the template that is attached and will include all relevant information. Following the conclusion of the grant, Camelot will provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the grant and its impact.

## Summary

This proposal establishes a Long Term Incentives Pilot Program for the DAO to test new incentive designs and answer the necessary questions to ensure we are ready to commit to the long-term program. This Pilot Program will distribute 25-45M ARB to protocols building on Arbitrum. The exact amount will be determined by the DAO via Snapshot vote and will be ratified via Tally vote. The program will distribute ARB to protocols for 12 weeks.

The specifications of the Pilot Program were designed to remedy the 3 largest complaints regarding STIP Round 1. The Pilot Program hopes to be a test run for these additions for the DAO to determine if they should also be included in the long-term framework.

#### Problem #1: Too large a burden placed on delegates

In the original STIP, delegates voted on each incentive proposal individually, with almost 100 snapshot votes. This was extremely tiring for delegates and left many feeling they could not make informed decisions on every proposal.

#### Solution #1

To remedy this problem, the Pilot Program will have a 5 person council elected by the DAO responsible for evaluating applications and selecting which protocols will advance to a snapshot vote to receive ARB. This will ensure all applications are thoughtfully evaluated with only the most deserving receiving incentives. Not only will this help to reduce the burden on delegates, but it will also help expedite the process and allow protocols to receive incentives quickly and efficiently.

#### Problem #2: Protocols did not receive adequate feedback on their proposals

A major gripe from protocols was they struggled to get feedback from delegates before the deadline. This left many feeling as though the better-connected protocols had an advantage as they were able to modify their proposals based on feedback to make them more competitive during the vote. Many protocols were willing to make changes to their applications to make them more appealing to the DAO but never received the proper feedback necessary to do so.

#### Solution #2

The Pilot Program introduces Application Advisors. This will be impartial organizations tasked with providing each applicant with detailed feedback and guidance on how to improve their applications. This ensures each applicant can iterate on their proposal so they can put forward the best possible incentive plan for the council.

#### Problem #3: Strict Limitations on Incentives Mechanisms

STIP Round 1 had strict limitations on how the ARB could be used as incentives. This was done to protect the DAO and prevent misuse of funds. However, the strict rules resulted in the stifling of many innovative incentive designs. Many protocols had interesting designs that used the ARB in ways that increased alignment, improved cost efficiency, or helped to limit the dumping of ARB. However, these designs were not permitted in Round 1 leading to almost all protocols resulting in generic liquidity incentive models.

#### Solution #3

The Pilot Program provides more flexibility to protocols to create innovative incentive structures. With the addition of the Council and Application Advisors, the Pilot Program does not require the rules to be as stringent. Malicious or inefficient designs will be first filtered out by the Application Advisors and then rejected by the council. Allowing protocols to innovate on incentive distribution mechanisms will allow Arbitrum protocols and community members to get a better idea of which designs work and which don’t work. This will help everyone as we prepare for a longer-term incentives program.

## Flow of V2

#### Application Period (2 week)

Protocols will have 2 weeks to apply using the Pilot Program application template. The application template will be created by the Council and the Application Advisors to ensure everyone has the same goals and make it easier for the council to process applications. Applications will be posted in the Pilot Program section of the Arbitrum forum. Protocols only need to post the initial draft of their application during this period. They will then have 2 additional weeks during the feedback period to edit their applications. No late submissions will be accepted.

#### Feedback Period (2 weeks)

During the feedback period, the Applications Advisors will provide feedback and guidance on all proposals. Protocols will be assigned an Application Advisor who will provide feedback and guidance on applications on a rolling basis. Protocols will then use this time to work with the Advisors to edit their proposals before applications lock at the end of the 2 weeks.

StableLab will also read all submissions during this period and highlight any rule violations to allow applicants to edit their submissions to ensure they comply with all program rules.

#### Screening Period (1 week)

During this period, the council will use the pre-determined rubric to grade each protocol and decide which protocols will advance to the voting period to receive ARB. The Council will use the rubric to select which applications will progress to a snapshot vote. The protocols that the council selects to advance to a snapshot vote must have a total funding amount that is equal to or lower than the incentives budget. This will ensure the DAO does not overspend should all Snapshot votes pass. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.

The rubric will be created by the Council and Application Advisors during the Tally voting period and will be publicly available by the time protocols begin to apply. The council will be required to publish a brief reasoning for all of their decisions on the forum to create transparency and accountability.

The council must judge applications as they are and cannot accept protocols at lower amounts than their application states. For example, if an application asks for 200,000 ARB the council can not fund them with 100,000 ARB

**EXAMPLE**: This is a hypothetical example using a budget of 10 ARB with 50 applicants that each request 1 ARB

50 protocols apply requesting 1 Arb Each -> Councils grades all 50 applications using the rubric and narrow the selection down to the top 10 applicants to not exceed the budget -> 10 snapshot votes are created to allow the DAO to confirm the council's decisions -> 9/10 Snapshot votes receive a majority of “fund” votes -> 9 protocols are funded with 1 ARB each and 1 Arb is returned to the DAO

#### Voting Period (1 Week)

Upon completion of the preliminary applicant screening process by the council, the selected applications will be formally presented for consideration. Each application will then be subject to a voting process via Snapshot, allowing Arbitrum delegates to vote on the allocation of funds. In the event that the Snapshot vote is favorably concluded, the respective protocol will commence receiving its funding through an Hedgey stream, facilitated by oSnap execution pending the protocol successfully passing KYC.

#### Incentives Period (12 weeks)

Selected protocols will receive their requested ARB using bi-weekly Hedgey streams for 12 weeks. During this time, protocols will be required to provide bi-weekly updates on the progress of their incentives using this [template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-bi-weekly-update-template/19436). Protocols will be required to finish their incentive distributions or return any unused funds two weeks after their final disbursement is available.

During this period Application Advisors will continue to work with the protocols to help them analyze and improve their distribution mechanisms. Protocols will be allowed to adjust their incentive plans as long as they do not violate any rules and provide their updated plans in their next bi-weekly update.

This Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) seeks to enhance user acquisition and engagement efficiency in the Arbitrum ecosystem following the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). The proposal aims to deploy 95 total quests across 62 unique applications. The goal is to provide a comprehensive onboarding, educational, and interaction model that results in sustained user commitment and thus solidifies Arbitrum’s position as a leading Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution.

Motivation

We propose an innovative solution to address an opportunity that has surfaced following the execution of the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) – the need for effectively onboarding, educating, and retaining new users on the Arbitrum platforms that received STIP. The STIP successfully provides incentive to perform onchain actions, but it does not address the user onboarding experience aspect of attracting new users. This proposal is viewed as the missing puzzle piece to STIP. In addition, the STIP had teams qualify, but not receive funding, providing a situation we aim to reconcile by running additional quests for those teams that will improve user retention and increase usage of their protocols.

Rationale

Our proposal aligns meticulously with Arbitrum’s mission to foster an inclusive, vibrant, and engaged community. By ensuring all users - existing and new ones - are carried along inclusively and effectively via well-designed quests, we will be creating an environment that promotes continued learning, interaction, and commitment. This “sticky factor” is critical for a sustainable and thriving ecosystem.

Key Terms

What are Quests?
Quests are guided learning activities, organized around specific crypto protocols and apps. They are designed to familiarize users with different protocols, their processes, and the potential benefits they offer within ecosystems like DeFi on Arbitrum.

Why are Quests Helpful?

Quests provide a hands-on learning experience which makes the understanding of complex protocols more enjoyable and interactive. They provide delightful step-by-step guidance which motivates users to explore and use these protocols, thereby increasing user adoption and contributing to the broader understanding of apps.

For instance, consider the quest on Layer3 called “Exploring Radiant”. It guides users through learning about onmichain money markets, swapping, and depositing on Radiant, breaking down each step into comprehensible segments.

By engaging with the quest, users not only learn how to use the Radiant platform, but also get practical experience which they can apply in real-world situations. Quests like these play a crucial role in demystifying DeFi protocols, making them more accessible, and bringing users to Arbitrum.

In the case of Exploring Radiant, it managed to attract 31,181 completions. This demonstrates the high engagement rate and efficiency of quests as interactive learning tools in the DeFi space. The large number of participants signifies that the quest was not only successful in providing valuable insights about the protocol but also in garnering interest from a wider community, thereby increasing the adoption rate of the whole Radiant platform.

But it isn’t just Radiant.

There is a whole library of Arbitrum quests available on Layer3. As part of the STIP Enhancement and Inclusion Quest Proposal, a whole new category will be created on Layer3 to display the quests included in the STIP Enhancement and Inclusion Quest Program

Why Layer3?
Layer3 has played a significant role in the growth of Arbitrum.

We’ve guided over 337,613 users to complete more than 5.9 million on-chain transactions on Arbitrum, all at no cost to the user or Arbitrum DAO. Our initiatives, particularly interactive quests, have already greatly increased user engagement and education on Arbitrum.

By transforming onchain operations into bite-sized, step-by-step quests, we have managed to make Arbitrum accessible to a wider audience. We have made it accessible and comprehensible to users, regardless of their technical proficiency level.

Specifications:
Teams:
Upon approval, we will embark on the design and execution of 95 quests structured strategically for the following protocols and teams in direct support of the STIP.

This includes one quest for each STIP-qualified protocol (29 projects, one quest each) and two quests for each recipient that received a greater than 50% majority in favor of their STIP proposal and more than 71.51 million ARB in support for their proposal (33 projects, two quests each). Each quest is meticulously designed to enhance user comprehension, interaction, and loyalty to the respective protocols.

The list of protocols and teams includes but is not limited to:

1	Camelot, Jones, Dopex, GMX, LODESTAR, Socket, Timeswap, RADIANT, Pendle Finance, MUX, Frax, Tally, Rysk, Silo Finance, Stella, Good Entry, Gamma, Umami, Abracadabra, KyberSwap, OpenOcean, Angle, Trader Joe, Dolomite, Premia, Vertex, Perennial Finance, Balancer, WINR

2	WOOFi, Gains Netowrk, DefiEdge, Synapse Protocol, PancakeSwap, Notional Finance, Rodeo, Magpie, Stargate, Savvy, Tales of Elleria, Thales, TIDE, Solv Protocol, Furucombo, dForce, Sanko GameCorp, RAMSES, Vela Exchange, Thetanuts, JOJO Exchange, Wormhole, Shell Protocol, REALM, unshETH, StakeDAO, Curve, iZUMi, Beefy Finance, Arrakis Finance, Florence Finance, CVI, Prime Protocol

Payment Terms:
The compensation for this proposal will encompass a real-time, continuous flow of 1 million ARB tokens, streamed via the Superfluid protocol. The stream will commence immediately post-approval and will run continuously up until May 19, 2024.

Should we fall short of fulfilling our obligations at any point within the specified period, a new proposal can be initiated to stop the stream of funds.

In the spirit of transparency, we commit to providing regular progress updates and upon completion of each of the 3 phases and maintaining Dune Analytics impact dashboards for the duration of the initiative, both at the application and ecosystem level. In a scenario where we fail to deliver our commitments, the community possesses the full right to propose halting the stream until the matter is adequately addressed and resolved.

Steps to Implement

Initiate a cooperative process with all STIP-qualified protocols to design a unique quest for each, and create two additional quests for the teams that met the criteria but weren’t granted STIP.

Implement the quests in month-long phases, during which we will monitor user engagement, quest completion rates, and user feedback, among other indicators.

Impact Analysis with Dune Dashboards: Post-sprint, we will analyze and present our impact utilizing detailed Dune dashboards. These dashboards will visually represent key metrics to paint a clear picture of the project’s success. Metrics categories include user engagement, unique user rates, and protocol specific metrics.

By confronting these steps, we can continuously refine our approach, ensuring that we provide mutually beneficial outcomes for both users and protocols involved in the STIP program.

Phase 1 - STIP Proposal Quests (November 2023 - January 2024): Quests specifically designed for all STIP-qualified protocols will be released in six groups, each running for a month. The intention is to boost user engagement with these protocols that have received official STIP funding and guide users on how to use STIP protocols.

Phase 2 - Non-STIP Proposal Quests 1 (February 2024 - April 2024): The second phase focuses on those teams that met the STIP criteria but did not receive funding. This stage ensures that these projects also get beneficial visibility and user engagement through their initial quests.

Phase 3 - Non-STIP Proposal Quests 2 (March 2024 - May 2024): The final phase continues the support for non-STIP funded projects, further providing engagement through a second quest for each team. This step is designed to maintain and enhance user interest and interaction, consolidating the engagement prompted in Phase 2.

Running two quests for non-STIP funded projects (Phase 2 and 3) is particularly beneficial as it contributes to user retention through a deeper experience with the protocol.

The first quest provides users with initial exposure to the protocol, its functions, and utility. It attracts & onboards new users and raises their curiosity, while also providing a sense of familiarity and comfort with the protocol.
The second quest aims to solidify this relationship. A user returns to reinforce their understanding and re-engage with the protocol – a follow-up to further strengthen the interaction between the user and protocol.
The aim is to attract users and provide a solid foundation for them to be engaged, active and aligned with the protocol over a longer period. This ultimately contributes to the longevity and sustainability of each protocol.

This phased approach allows us to target attention to each group of protocols, ensuring each has optimized quests and yields the best possible results for all involved.

Overall Cost Estimate:
The total cost to implement this AIP is 1M ARB where:

Recurring costs will entail updates and maintenance, community engagement efforts, partnerships, performance tracking, and reporting.

This proposal lends to Arbitrum’s goal to build an engaged and knowledgeable community committed to the platform’s longevity. By incorporating all users in a guided and rewarding learning journey, we act as a funnel for new Arbitrum users, rather than current participants dominating rewards. By also acknowledging and rewarding the efforts of teams that did not qualify for STIP, we foster a fairer and more inclusive community spirit, further underlining Arbitrum’s commitment to its members.

This dynamic, transparent, and comprehensive approach propels the strength and sustainability of the Arbitrum community.",bullish,0.9229,2023-10-25 12:31:28+00:00,0.9975,0.9975,2023-10-26 00:00:00+00:00,8.08321594972369,0.92605,0.0034131541878859,0.8839571475982666,True," This proposal outlines a plan to engage with various protocols on the Arbitrum network using a phased approach called ""Quests.""

### TL;DR
This proposal requests 3.971 million ARB (0.08% of the total treasury) to fund the first of three milestones in a comprehensive plan to build an Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program.

If successful, the project will further establish Arbitrum as the go to scaling solution for Ethereum.

Milestone 1 is the start of this journey with a funding request that breaks down as follows:
1. 2.6 million ARB (72%): Funding Arbitrum ecosystem development
2. 450k ARB (12.5%): Plurality Labs Services
3. 260k ARB (7.2%): Grant Program Managers
4. 300k ARB (8.3%): Matching Gitcoin funding pools using Arbitrum
5. 361k ARB project buffer*

*Representing 10% of funds requested. This will be used as a project buffer with funds either deployed in support of the program, recycled into ecosystem development or returned to Arbitrum DAO.

Successful completion of these deliverables will be a major value driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem. This success of this program will be assessed through metrics including, but not limited to:

* Number of active developers
* Dev Github quality
* Delegate engagement satisfaction
* Voter participation
* Capture-resistance

### Deliverables

At the end of Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will have delivered:

**Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops**

* Conduct Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values workshops
* Clearly define funding priorities in a bottom-up way
* Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program
* Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum
* Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program

**Design | Construct best in class Pluralistic Grants Program**

* Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)
* Design and process map the end to end grant funding flows
* Design approach, process and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas
* Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure
* Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria
* Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum
* Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence

**Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs**

* Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices
* Deploy 2.6 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers
* Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients
* Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse

**Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes**

* Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes and other relevant metrics requested by the community
* Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community
* Collate community feedback and input on grants programs efficacy and success
* Evaluate, review and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program

### Motivation

We are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow their ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum’s ability to actualize its full potential. It’s easy to say, “we can solve these problems later”, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today

The Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.

### Issues with fully Centralized and Decentralized Grants Programs

Within web3 we have seen three main vehicles by which Grants Funding can be allocated to builders. Below we have outlined why we believe Arbitrum DAO should take a pluralist approach to grants funding.

### Centralised Grants Program: Problems
 
![0311b2837f5d19e1de6302c085e0eb8b800963cf_2_624x345.png](ipfs://bafkreidp5ob5oiuy77fqrklknkgy2jujbdeavyhhxyxptnaar7txya4ybu)
    
* Limited transparency and auditability: A centrally managed grants program may lack transparency in decision-making processes, grant distribution, and fund allocation. This opacity can undermine trust and hinder the overall effectiveness of the program
* Limited community participation: Web3 communities thrive on active participation and collaboration. A centrally managed grants program may not effectively engage community members at all levels of the organization in the decision-making and codesign processes.
* Domain expertise and scale: Volume of grants requests may overwhelm capacity of small centralized team who may also lack domain specific expertise on programs requesting funding
* Bias and limited experimentation: Centralized Grants teams bring their standardized approach to grant vetting leading to a lack of experimentation which creates an inherent selection bias. The selection bias can even be non-malicious as they are biased by forces like being more likely to “open the door” for those who they know or have worked with before.h.

### Decentralised Grants Program: Problems

![b5cb3f790e8de949030775b29bba6030f6ef6421_2_624x287.png](ipfs://bafkreidqzewoyc2jyhr6a5mbqrcaml4cowvjqbp7bmtjgpzyfe2hqcwcbe)
    
* Lack of time: Delegates will stop engaging if the request is for more than is reasonable. Reviewing a grant, especially if it is a direct grant for larger amounts can be expected to take from 1-4 hours each. Delegates cannot take that much time.
* Inclusion and accessibility: Navigating the delegates and governance process of a large DAO represents a major lift for any prospective grants applicants. Those able to do so will likely have the best network and most capital, not necessarily the best grants ideas…
* Lack of coordination: With a decentralized grants program, decision-making and coordination are distributed among multiple stakeholders. This can lead to challenges in achieving consensus, coordinating efforts, and aligning priorities.
* Evaluation of impact: It is challenging for the DAO to assess the relative impact of different grants programs if no standardized reporting cadence, key metrics and evaluation criteria is maintained centrally.
* Mitigating risks and fraud: Decentralized grants programs are vulnerable to risks such as fraudulent proposals, mismanagement of funds, and malicious actors. Implementing mechanisms for due diligence, verification, reputation systems and Sybil defense can help mitigate these risks and protect the integrity of grants funding.
* Not fully developed: Even solutions like quadratic funding which lets users directly express their interest still require a program manager. They must shepherd the round and ensure quality fraud protection while making objective decisions about eligibility criteria, user and project appeals, and more. Until we design the open and permissionless protocol to handle these subjective components, the model still has single points of failure.

### Launching the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program

A Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the “best of both worlds.

At its core the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefits the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.

The programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.

Our approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.

Milestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.

![0e9c91acb14f197ac0396d79f28b7f530aedfd36_2_624x363.png](ipfs://bafkreiaumlf7kbilxwrxnx7hixajjiz5pzbpr73ciybkkgdnbqsjefqzru)
    
> 💡The Pluralist Grants Programs will be selected after the proposal passes governance and the Discovery Phase is completed.

During the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.

Once this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.

We have observed that many previous grants programs has struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:

* Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas
* Create a backlog of “high impact work to be done” be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO
* Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the “high impact work that needs to be done”
* Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community
* Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions

The selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:

* Previous experience delivering grants programs.
* Domain expertise and knowledge
* Ability to source innovate grants projects and support in the maintenance of a health pipeline of grants submission
* Maturity of program specific processes and tooling
* Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of mechanism
* Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values

This is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.

With this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

### The Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.

This is not payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to grant recipients in a Gitcoin Arbitrum round we intend to launch. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users which might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.

Funding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem, but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.

### Improved Accountability, Transparency and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model.

Web3 spends 100’s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spend. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.

By using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand alone grant environments.

By doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant-execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.

Grant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.

We know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects, while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.

### Multisig Management

All funds will be sent to a Grants Safety Multisig*. This multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program. The role of the grants multisig is to process the requests made by Plurality Labs while also being able to review issues. At no point will Plurality Labs hold the funds designated for grant funding. The final form of this proposal will either name the selected individual or state the electoral process.

> 💡 We also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.

### Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3

The overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.

Prior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures. They will provide a breakdown at that time based on how this project evolves.

Milestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. After Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for this whole process to run on chain.

If successful, Plurality Labs would no longer be needed as a project manager of the overall grants program. Onchain decisions of the community would allocate funding to the programs which have been proven useful. Plurality labs could then be an equal peer to any other program competing for a portion of continuous funding available to the ecosystem.

* Addressing councils reservations around Protocol Performance:

Since launching Buffer on Arbitrum in September 2022, the protocol has demonstrated significant market fit, initially generating an average of 5,000 USDC in fees daily. Buffer employs an AMM-based model similar to GMX, where the Buffer Liquidity Pool (BLP) facilitates market-making for exotic options trading. Buffer runs on a similar AMM based model as GMX - where the BLP (Buffer Liquidity Pool) provides market-making liquidity for exotic options trading.

Following our September 2023 launch of Buffer v2.5, we implemented stringent risk management strategies—including tighter open interest caps and spreads—to maintain positive expectancy for the AMMs and safeguard LP interests (a trajectory similar to that of GMX and GMX v2). During this time, due to market fluctuations and competitor activities influenced our trading volume and performance, leading to weeks of lower averages post-launch.

Recently, we initiated the Bull vs Bear Trading Competition, which, coupled with a relaxation of our conservative risk management policies, has reignited interest and activity within the protocol. Currently, the daily volume averages over 16,000 USDC.

* Measures to prevent Wash Trading:

Buffer’s League based competition makes gaming the system incredibly difficult. The competition is designed to reward consistent, ongoing performance instead of a single one-time score.

Pending rewards are accumulated based on rank on the leaderboard. Total rewards for each rank are calculated based on a geometric sequence - to ensure that each position on the leaderboard earns more than the place below it, rather than grouping leaderboard standings into equal reward buckets.

Trading leagues will have a cap on incentives based on fees earned to prevent any wash trading – this is further prevented by being focused on PnL, although volume may play a factor.

* Accountability and Implementation:

On top of our [Dashboard](https://app.buffer.finance/#/leaderboard/galxe?week=3) and [Stats](https://stats.buffer.finance/arbitrum) page, we set up Dune Dashboards for tracking metrics around the initiatives. We will commit to regular updates around the protocol performance, especially around metrics including:

* BLP TVL
* Trading Volume
* Trading Fee Generated
* User growth and retention
* Effective prevention of wash trading around competitions.

* Details on Social Features:

As the new incentive layer unfolds on Buffer, we will introduce several features to increase stickiness and drive trading activity:

1. Revamped Optopi Collection: Optopi is a collection of 8,888 unique PFP friendly NFTs on Arbitrum offering key utilities to traders. We plan to revamp the Optopi utility to offer exclusive features including: exclusive access to trading leagues (higher tier in trading leagues), discounts while buying payout boosts.

2. Chatting rooms: allowing users to engage directly with other users on the platform who are interested in that community or page.

3. Trading Challenges: allowing traders to engage into battle royale-styled PvP challenges to facilitate user onboarding and community building.

4. Low risk PVP trading: play tokens or virtual tokens that allow traders to trade risk free on Buffer.

## Constitutional / Non-Constitutional

Constitutional

## Abstract

We propose to unlock ARB utility and improve the governance and security of the Arbitrum protocol by implementing ARB staking, without yet turning on fee distribution to token holders. Through ARB staking, token holders who delegate to active governance participants will be able to capture value. The proposal will also implement a liquid staked ARB token (stARB) via the Tally Protocol that enables any future rewards to auto-compound, is (re)stakeable, and is compatible with DeFi. Separately, we will work with the Arbitrum DAO to decide whether and how to fund rewards and split rewards between token holders and delegates.

## Motivation

The ARB token is struggling to accrue value.

* Governance power is the only source of fundamental demand for ARB, while there are multiple sources of new supply (unlocks, treasury spending).
* The ability to restake ARB or use it on DeFi is not compatible with governance. Voting power breaks when ARB is deposited into smart contracts. [Less than 1%](https://dune.com/queries/3732998/6278607) of ARB tokens are used actively in the onchain ecosystem.
 
![image](ipfs://bafkreihwhaicuuh3c7t3zvpe3xtqy3djrcp3jrqwslcxu4bpzhcvf2iwmu)
    
The ARB token is struggling as a governance mechanism

* Only about 10% of the circulating supply of ARB is [actively used](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates) in governance
* Voter participation in the DAO has been [steadily declining](https://dune.com/queries/3829223/6440489) since DAO launch
 
![image](ipfs://bafkreidgp7nukhkti7w65mntaqfztqr6wrefiwfry7tgiuwhgqokyg36t4)
    
Meanwhile, the Arbitrum DAO treasury has accumulated over [16 Million $ETH](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/treasury) in surplus fees from Arbitrum One and Nova. As a result, it is becoming economically attractive for a malicious actor to launch a governance attack on the DAO treasury. The potential profit of attacking the DAO treasury is increasing as more ETH accumulates in the treasury, while the cost of attacking the DAO through purchasing ARB for its voting power is not increasing proportionally to defend against attacks. A more developed version of this dynamic exists in the ENS and Compound DAOs, both of which are actively fighting off governance attacks (ENS documented [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090/10)).

ARB staking unlocks utility and aligns governance by creating a mechanism to stream future rewards from DAO-generated sources like sequencer fees, MEV fees, validator fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification to token holders who are delegated to an active governance participant. ARB staking makes ARB usable in restaking and DeFi by returning voting power locked in contracts to the DAO.

## Rationale

This proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more sustainable and secure.

## Specifications and Steps to Implement

### System architecture

ARB staking enables ARB utility while allowing the DAO to retain governance power. It includes a few modular components that come together to power the system.

ARB staking via the Tally governance staking system

* Has the power to distribute fees proportionally to token holders who have delegated voting power to an active governance participant.

The DAO

* Has the power to turn on fee distribution and send fees to ARB staking
* Controls how voting power is distributed to delegates, including delegation strategies for unused voting power

stARB (Tally Protocol LST)

* Auto-compounds potential rewards if they are turned on in the future
* Provides token holders a liquid position
* Allows stARB holders to continue delegating directly to their preferred delegate. This can be accomplished through Flexible Voting, or by deploying surrogate contracts for each depositor. 
* Returns voting power to the DAO if stARB is deposited into restaking, DeFi, or centralized exchange smart contracts that do not maintain a 1:1 delegation relationship. The Arbitrum DAO exclusively has the ability to determine how this voting power is distributed/redelegated via a governance proposal. The DAO will decide how to set up the initial redelegation logic for stARB.

# Abstract

This proposal outlines a one-time backfund to all ""approved but not funded proposals’’ from Arbitrum STIP. The proposed AIP increases the total budget by 21.4M to 71.4M while increasing the total participating protocols by 26, for a total of 56 funded projects. The program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while leveraging distribution systems, consensus, and delegate diligence already created from STIP 1.

This program is designed to backfund approved protocols while maintaining the timelines and systems of STIP 1:

* Timeline: The program is scheduled to commence and conclude concurrently with STIP 1, or within a similar timeframe, starting from the first week of November and running through January 31, 2024.
* KYC: The program will utilize the same KYC system as STIP 1.
* Reporting: Participating grantees are required to self-report data, maintain dashboards, and regularly summarize grant performance

# Considerations

Before this proposal was drafted, a working group was formed to gauge sentiment, gather key data points, and outline the proposal's structure. The working group collaborated with delegates and projects affected by the STIP, engaging in multiple calls—including sessions with the creators of the STIP and the Incentive Working Group—to solicit feedback and refine the proposal accordingly.

Key concerns discussed include:

### Why not just push towards a round 2 and go through voting for all proposals again?

First and foremost, we believe that the successful execution of this Backfund proposal will, in time, serve as a crucial catalyst for future grant structures, including a successful STIP round 2. Why? This opportunity will unify the Arbitrum ecosystem by addressing key weaknesses in the original STIP 1 structure by quickly providing approved projects and other stakeholders with the resources/data needed to design and support future programs.

Key issues associated with delaying an immediate backfund and moving towards a round 2 include:

* Proper design and execution add considerable time delay to a highly competitive environment within Arbitrum and other L2s
* Requires teams with limited resources approved already for STIP 1 to spend significant time lobbying delegates
* Removes attention away from new Round 2 proposals
* Adds additional burden to delegates that should be focused on long-term design improvements and new STIP grants not yet approved
* Removes key data for STIP experiment analysis by skewing learnings towards larger, well-established projects
* Delays the alignment of the STIP with the Arbitrum constitution values of inclusivity and diversity
* Negatively impacts new builder sentiment towards Arbitrum at a critical time in the L2 Wars


### The budget set aside was 50M, and the DAO decided that was the acceptable spend for a short-term incentive.

While the budget was set at 50M, the original working group proposed 75M so that:

> ""The budget was raised to 75M ARB to accommodate larger protocols (Pinnacle Grants) without compromising smaller applications."" [tnorm, September 3rd 2023.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131/12)

Excess demand was a significant possibility due to the high interest in STIP and the absence of a cap for Pinnacle grants. Voters lacked the data to ascertain whether the initial 50M would be adequate to achieve the objectives of STIP.

Noteworthy is that, in the event of excess demand, measures including backfunding were already outlined as potential options.

Proper design and fulfillment of a Round 2 or similar future funding programs may take time to develop. Meanwhile, projects that received approval but no funding have immediate initiatives requiring support. Our opportunity is to fund these initiatives, level the competitive playing field, and enhance the data available for the STIP process.

### Voting behaviors for a 50M proposal shouldn’t carry over to a proposal that includes the additional backfunded amounts.

During our consultation process, we engaged in numerous discussions that brought forth questions about backfunding. Despite the criticisms, backfunding remains the most straightforward method to address the current STIP’s skewed sample size. We advocate that backfunding is the optimal approach to achieve the STIP’s intended outcomes—specifically, to examine the impact that incentives have on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem. 

Furthermore, if the STIP continues without rectifying the issues with its sample, the analysis will be compromised by a significant methodological flaw. Backfunding is not just the “best” option; it is essential for preserving the integrity of the STIP overall.

Voting behavior might have differed if the budget cap were set at 75M or 100M. The only way to determine this would be to repeat the experiment with a raised cap (an option that is unfeasible as time travel has not yet been realized).

It's helpful for us to remember the original objectives of the STIP:

* To provide incentives to a diverse and inclusive group of Arbitrum projects.
* To quickly establish an incentives program that is in harmony with Arbitrum's values and constitution.
* To generate robust, meaningful data to shape the future design of Arbitrum grants for projects of all types and sizes.


# Motivation

> Motivation - A statement on why the Arbitrum community should implement the AIP.

How can Arbitrum create an incentives structure to grow the ecosystem? STIP started when the community began investigating creative uses for incentives. A short-term program was devised to act quickly, collect data about how incentives are used by Arbitrum protocols, and learn from the results to design new programs and grow the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

An unexpected budget problem caused many successful STIP applications to receive no funding. The real-world consequence of this mistake caused the STIP sample to be cut in half - but not at random. To determine the final STIP cohort, the applications were sorted by approval, which inadvertently skewed the sample towards incumbent protocols. This sampling bias is most egregious for collecting data about the smallest protocols; over 70% of Beacon grants were rejected due to the sorting algorithm that was used. Consequently, STIP may not be collecting sufficient data about new builders on Arbitrum.

This AIP seeks to achieve STIP's original motivations by:

1) nearly doubling the sample size;
2) adding protocols across a broad array of industry categories; and
3) including protocols at different stages of development.

This AIP will ensure an important builder population is included in the study, while increasing the validity of the STIP results.

One of the most important questions facing Arbitrum today is how to grow the ecosystem and win the L2 Wars. STIP is a novel study on the impact of incentives for growing the Arbitrum ecosystem. In practice, the STIP excluded most new builders from the study, severely limiting the data that will be collected about the early stages of the builder pipeline. This AIP includes a broader range of protocols in the STIP study, ensuring that Arbitrum gets the data it needs about how incentives impact new builders in the Arbitrum ecosystem. It stands to reason that extending incentives to smaller projects could serve to incubate projects that grow into the high-usage dApps of tomorrow. Extending the STIP may not only increase the inclusivity of the program but also incentivize significant growth for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem at a lower cost per project, and this possibility is worth exploring.

# Rationale

`Rationale - An explanation of how the AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values`

Arbitrum's community values highlight the importance of diversity, which increases the fitness of the entire Arbitrum ecosystem by representing the needs of many kinds of participants. The original work to design STIP was careful to consider how both large and small protocols would fare under the framework. However, the unexpected budget cutoff caused the sample to skew towards large protocols, which is at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community. The cost of falling short of this ideal is that STIP systematically overlooks the possibility that incentives might be uniquely interesting to small and new protocols. By failing to incorporate protocols at the first stages of the builders onboarding pipeline, Arbitrum will be unsure about how incentives operate among this crucial group of protocols.

The Arbitrum community also values neutrality, which received careful consideration during the STIP design stages. It was well-understood that incumbent protocols were likely to prevail with their STIP applications - but it was hoped this would not preclude smaller participants from also being funded. Unfortunately, this wish for inclusion was not fulfilled and - unintentional though it may have been - funding was nevertheless distributed according to a ranking that was likely to favor incumbents. Again, despite the best efforts of the DAO and the STIP designers, the result was at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community.

Above all, Arbitrum seeks to create and nurture a thriving ecosystem - and the DAO's values are designed to provide guiding values that will always trend towards the health of the ecosystem. When the values aren't met - even unintentionally - it is possible the best interests of the ecosystem aren't met, either. In the case of STIP, accidentally excluding Beacon grants falls short of the community values - which, in all likelihood, is a critical oversight that Arbitrum would benefit from fixing.

150,286,587,587,587,2023-11-02 22:39:53+00:00,arbitrum,"## Abstract
Home to some of the best smart contract security researchers in the market and one of the strongest Developer Relations teams in the industry - professionals in Cyfrin come from backgrounds like Chainlink, Compound, Alchemy, Aragon, WorldCoin, Microsoft, Google, and other popular FinTech companies.

Through this proposal, Cyfrin would like to request $2M to improve and foster the security and longevity of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

We will do this through launching the Arbitrum Security Enhancement Fund dedicated to sponsoring audits for Arbitrum projects.

## Motivation
Blockchains solve global issues no other technology today has been able to solve: verifiable accountability, unbiased data exchange, trust without intermediaries, online ownership, permissionless transactions, global identities, to name a few…

Yet, until Web3 is safe, it is not scalable.

In July, total losses in the DeFi sector breached $77B according to a report from CryptoSlate. In 2022 alone, DeFi experienced hacks resulting in losses of over $3.1B. In 2023, a staggering $2.3B has already been stolen, indicating a trajectory higher than the previous year.

This is a security problem, a best practices problem, and a branding problem - rightfully keeping away institutions and users from a world-changing technology. Not solving this makes any effort of making web3 mainstream, vain.
 
![7dbb9b4b71e82d06bc9ed50d172fbd4f740875d5.png](ipfs://bafkreig3zhjhipa7wcbmrhahe3smkhj6ytridrczvc4gizwkkkliyordde)
    
Every time there is a hack on an Arbitrum project, both the Arbitrum ecosystem and the entire industry, suffer.

Getting this right increases adoption at scale. Value exchange technologies without developers capable of using them appropriately have a hard time succeeding. Value exchange technologies with developers and protocols lacking security best practices create an unsafe environment for everyone participating.

– The future of crypto hinders on projects prioritizing smart contract security.

Cyfrin commits to leveraging our team of industry experts to strengthen, support, and secure Arbitrum’s ecosystem and its developers.

## Rationale
Leveraging our auditing, engineering, and educational skill sets, the Cyfrin team will keep projects built on Arbitrum and its users safe. Through this proposal, Cyfrin aims to contribute to the long-term success of the Arbitrum ecosystem through attracting incoming TVL for the Arbitrum ecosystem, gain user trust, and show traction to potential future investors.

Laser-focused on Web3 security, Cyfrin is a market leader in smart contract audits. Cyfrin offers everything from private audits to competitive public and private audits, as well as a multi-phase auditing approach we’ve designed to ensure stronger security guarantees.

Additionally, you may find case studies for Oku Trade and SudoSwap to learn more about how Cyfrin works.

Some testimonials from clients:

“It was a pleasure to work with the Cyfrin team. Their approach to security and meticulous testing is exceptionally thorough. Additionally, their intimate knowledge of the Chainlink protocol made them particularly useful for our audit.” - Getty Hill, Oku Trade Founder

“Working with Cyfrin feels like a true partnership — they are just plain good at what they do and above all are as motivated as anyone to move our industry’s security practices forward” - Beanstalk

“Working with Cyfrin was a good experience, they kept in touch throughout the entire audit, and also followed up post-launch. Competitive with the best of the firms."" - 0xmons from Sudorandom Labs

Through this proposal, we’re asking Arbitrum to fund a Security Enhancement Fund to audit projects built on its infrastructure. The fund will allocate funds to private, competitive, or multi-phase audits for projects built on Arbitrum.

Cyfrin will power the long-term success of Arbitrum protocols, so protocols feel safer going to market and users more comfortable interacting with the Arbitrum chain.

## Key Terms
Audit: An audit is a service where a security researcher reviews a codebase in depth with the intent of finding potential vectors for exploitation. Once completed, a report is presented to the protocol to fix any potential vulnerabilities found.

Private audit: A team, consisting of usually 2-3 security researchers, spends weeks looking at a protocol’s codebase with the aim of finding the most critical exploit vectors in a codebase, as well as perform architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, etc.

Public Competitive Audit: An audit where hundreds, if not thousands, of security researchers review a codebase and compete for funds in a set reward pool based on the complexity of vulnerabilities found, its impact, and its uniqueness.

Private Competitive Audit: An invite-only audit where a protocol invites top-performing auditors to review their code and compete in community driven audit competition.

Multi-Phase Audit: a new, innovative model known as the Diverge-Converge Multi-Phase Model. Crafted to maximize the quality of audits, a critical aspect in the Web3 space, by strategically incentivizing auditors and ensuring that the protocol codebase goes through at least three comprehensive auditing phases, enhancing the protocol’s ultimate security.

## Specifications
The entirety of the funds will be allocated towards funding security reviews for protocols, including the costs to run the audits, hire auditors, promote contests, bring judges, do customer support, and competition moderation.

The Fund will match up to 60% for the audit requested. The remaining amount will have to be paid by the project itself requesting for funding. This is mostly to weed out projects just looking for a free audit, ensuring we’re truly enabling long-lasting impact for the ecosystem.

The one exception to this rule is projects who are already deployed on Arbitrum and who can prove a high number of active users, total value locked, or who provide user retention and stickiness across the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole. Establishing the details of what “high” means in this case will be a task of the Allocation Committee once formed.

These audits may come in the form of competitive audits, through our CodeHawks platform, private audits through our security research team, or through our multi-phased approach combining the above.

## Audit Types
Competitive Audits
CodeHawks, one of the leading competitive auditing platforms in the market and home to some of the top security experts in the industry, enhances the security of protocols through community-driven smart contract security reviews.

On CodeHawks, hundreds of auditors study, test, stress, and review the same protocol’s codebase for a defined amount of time - finding bugs and potential exploit vectors. Auditors then submit the findings to the platform for judge review and monetizing based on the vulnerabilities uncovered.

Private Audits
Private audits, an option tailored to yet-to-be deployed, and already-live protocols. A hand-in-hand relationship between protocol’s engineering team and our security research squad is formalized to uncover vulnerabilities and support developers with state-of-the-art best practices guidance.

Through constant communication, the protocol’s engineering team is able to revise vulnerabilities as soon as they’re found - ensuring the team can start working on fixes immediately. Auditors also provide architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, specific knowledge like formal verification, code smells, testing feedback, etc.

Multi-phase Audits
Designed for large and more complex protocols, the Multi-Phase audit approach has the stronger security guarantee of them all since it encourages the protocol to go through several audit phases before completing the final report.

To learn more about the Multi-Phase Audits, review here.

## Allocation Committee
The Allocation Committee is the group responsible for determining which projects should receive audit funding. Cyfrin will lead the charge of setting this Committee up within 2 weeks of proposal approval.

The multisig account for the Allocation Committee will contain 5 people (3 from Arbitrum’s side, 2 from Cyfrin). Each team (Cyfrin and Arbitrum) will select who from their organizations will represent them in the Allocation Committee within 10 days of proposal approval.

Once composed, the committee will determine any additional eligibility criteria and share them with the community before opening up the application funnel. The application funnel should open within a maximum of one month post proposal approval.

Additionally, the Allocation Committee is responsible for defining the appropriate application process and reviewing applications on a recurrent basis. The process for reviewing these applications, as well as how often the Committee meets will be determined by the members based on the amount of applications received and their complexity.

We saw the community gather together under the STIP proposal and would like the same community participatory process to guide the direction of how the fund allocates the distribution. It’s a discovery process that we will run, partnering with Arbitrum to validate findings and iterate repeatedly.

## Eligibility criteria for protocols applying to the Security Enhancement Fund
The Security Enhancement Fund aims at improving the security of all projects that have already deployed or will be deploying into the Arbitrum chain.

Any protocol that adds value to the Arbitrum ecosystem across DeFi, Gaming, DAOs, or social projects, real world assets tokenization, track and trace solutions, or any other track, bringing a healthy and sustainable contribution to the ecosystem, is welcomed to apply.

Projects should have already deployed to Arbitrum mainnet to apply, although exceptions can be made for:

Protocols who commit to deploying on Arbitrum within 6 months of the audit - if this is the case, the code being audited must be deployed exclusively on Arbitrum for 6 months before launching elsewhere. The Allocation Committee will determine when taking such a risk is worth the assessment.

Protocols who already have deployed and gained traction on other chains, looking to deploy to Arbitrum as well - if this is the case, information regarding the protocol’s TVL, active user base, and Arbitrum strategy should be shared in the application for review by the Allocation Committee.

## Ineligible Projects
In an effort to keep the Arbitrum ecosystem secure and sustainable, we comply and leverage Arbitrum’s guidelines 2 to determine which projects are ineligible to apply for the Security Enhancement Fund.

Additionally, the Allocation Committee may establish additional guidelines for ineligible projects.

## Security Enhancement Fund Distribution
The 100% of the funds from the Security Enhancement Fund will be used to audit Arbitrum projects.

The fund allocation per project will cover 60% of the protocol audit, expecting the protocol to cover the rest. The reasoning behind this is to ensure only protocols serious about their long-term growth get audited. However, an exception of sponsoring 80% of the audit could be made for unique situations as established by the Allocation Committee, like for a protocol amounting for large ecosystem growth or a large protocol deploying to Arbitrum.

This makes it extremely convenient for protocols built on Arbitrum to enhance the security of their codebase and protect users’ assets.

Audit prices are aligned with industry standards and calculated based on the complexity of the codebase under review.

For competitive audits, the prize pool is calculated as approximately $30 multiplied by the number of lines of code in the code base.

For private audits, the cost is calculated as $60,000 multiplied by the number of weeks required by the auditors to read, understand, and review the code base in scope. The time required for each audit is evaluated before the security review by the lead auditor assigned to the project and will be made publicly available to the community.

Protocols are permitted to undergo one or multiple smart contract security reviews per protocol update. The number of reviews is determined based on the codebase size, as indicated below:

For codebases or protocol updates with less than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 1 per type.

For codebases or protocol updates with more than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 2 per type.

nSloc is an objective measure and industry that stands for Normalized Source Code. Calculated reducing all multiline functions declarations to a single line, removing all comments and empty lines and counting the remaining number of lines of code.

Whatever allocation we don’t spend, at the end of the year we will return to the DAO for further use.

## Steps to implement
Within the next year, the Cyfrin team commits to:

1. Technical implementation of creating the Allocation Committee’s multisig and define its members
2. Allocation Committee details eligibility requirements and allocation criteria
3. Define and implement process for protocols to apply for audits alongside the Allocation Committee
4. Review applications and start distributing funds strategically for protocols who meet the criteria
5. Pair auditors with protocols
6. Kick-off auditing process
7. Amplify the Security Enhancement Fund as a great reason for projects to choose Arbitrum as their L2 of choice, as well as promotion of the protocols Cyfrin audits
8. Final report to protocols

– Keep in mind, this process may vary depending on whether the protocol is undergoing a private, competitive or multi-phase audit.

Audit Team: Our team of security researchers are experts across a variety of fields like DeFi, oracles, Web3 social, and more. They come from the industry’s top auditor leaderboard and are dedicated entirely to the private audits.

## Cost
The budget for this proposition totals $2 million.

The entirety of the funds is dedicated towards the sponsoring of audits for protocols deployed or deploying on Arbitrum.

The entirety of the funds will be expected upon proposal approval to maintain a rapid response to audit requests and safeguard protocol integrity.

Upon the onchain approval of the proposal, these funds will be transferred to the Allocation Committee’s multi-sig, as set up by Cyfrin containing the 2 Cyfrin Committee representatives. The multi-sig’s first transaction will then add the 3 Arbitrum representatives before transferring any funds to protocols.

Additionally, Cyfrin suggests the Allocation Committee reimburses the DAO quarterly in the event that the minimum expected capital for that quarter ($500,000) isn’t spent within that time period. This will also enable a tangible oversight mechanism for the DAO to ensure Cyfrin is doing the expected work.

## Why $2M?

At an average cost of $60,000, sponsored at 60%, $2M would cover anywhere from 20-25 audits in the span of a year.

Although the cost of an audit varies widely based on codebase size, complexity, and audit type, audit prices typically range between $30,000-$100,000, with an average audit being ~$60,000.

Assuming the Fund covers 60% of the audit, $2M are estimated to cover anywhere from 20-25 audits within the span of a year. Additionally, 70% of the fund will be used to cover existing protocols on Abitrum, with the remaining 30% used to cover new protocols launching on the chain.

– Important to note that in order to have the best possible security for a protocol, projects often go through 2 or more audits - including private and competitive audits. Particularly for complex projects already holding a high TVL, a multi-phase audit is highly advised to decrease the chances of an exploit to an absolute minimum.

Considering Arbitrum is believed to have 1.2M total commits and over 1,100 Arbitrum repositories, with over 450 active developers, this fund would cover ~10% of Arbitrum’s development.

   Description: This proposal outlines the establishment of a $2 million fund dedicated to sponsoring audits for protocols deployed or planning to deploy on Arbitrum. The fund aims to enhance security and integrity within the Arbitrum ecosystem by covering 60% of the audit costs, with the remaining 40% to be covered by the protocols themselves.

   Roles:
     1. Founder & Community Manager: To foster peer-to-peer relationships, manage technical support for students going through Arbitrum courses, and support CodeHawks auditors.
     2. Design Team: To create visually engaging and user-friendly materials for the Arbitrum developer community and CodeHawks auditors.
     3. CodeHawks Team: To run, promote, judge, support, and moderate competitions, onboard protocols, and manage the entire competition cycle from start to finish.
     4. Audit Team: A team of security researchers who will conduct private audits for protocols on Arbitrum.

   Budget: $2 million

   Explanation of Cost: At an average cost of $60,000, sponsored at 60%, $2M would cover approximately 20-25 audits in a year. The fund will prioritize existing protocols on Arbitrum (70%) and new protocols launching on the chain (30%). In order to ensure optimal security for a protocol, projects often go through multiple audits, including private and competitive audits.

   Framework on Payments, Reporting, and Oversight: Cyfrin pledges to publish financial reports every quarter outlining expenditure details, audits funded, decisions made, and progress updates. These reports will be posted in the Arbitrum DAO’s forum for periodic review. The funds will be transferred to the Allocation Committee’s multi-sig upon proposal approval, with the multi-sig containing representatives from Cyfrin and Arbitrum. In case the minimum expected capital for a quarter isn't spent within that time period, the DAO can reimburse Cyfrin quarterly to ensure accountability.

Executive Summary
As voted on in the ADPC proposal, one of the key tasks of the ADPC was to conceptualize and structure a subsidy fund for the Arbitrum DAO. This proposal intends to set up this subsidy fund, seeking up to $10 million worth of ARB to be administered and selected by the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as the ‘ADPC’) to facilitate the selection of projects that will benefit from the whitelisted security audit service providers selected via the ADPC’s procurement framework. The ultimate decision will be made by the ADPC based on the Means Test and the Application Process Terms 13.

Proposal Request
We propose the creation of a procurement subsidy fund allocating up to $10 million worth of ARB to provide financial assistance to both new and existing projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

These subsidies will be exclusive to a pre-approved whitelisted set of security audit service providers, selected by the ADPC, who will publicly display their fees. This approach eliminates the need for the ADPC to assess the reasonableness of funds requests.

The aim of the subsidy fund is to incentivise participation and growth among smaller projects helping them to overcome barriers to entry, such as challenges to acquire funding to pay for the cost of robust security audits.

The figure of up to $10 million worth of ARB has been determined via a benchmarking exercise conducted with various security audit service providers. This form 4 was shared with these service providers and based on the responses of 10 service providers (including the likes of Spearbit, Halborn, Nethermind, Three Sigma, Guardian, Zellic, etc.) on their scope of services and fees associated, we have estimated that each project will require a 2-month security audit at an average cost of $200K. This will enable the ADPC to potentially fund up to 50 projects; however, it should be noted that the average of $200K is an estimate and fees are usually specific to each project, each project requires a scoping exercise, and audit costs will vary based on the size of the codebase, complexity, etc.

We ask delegates delegates to choose between following options for the initial size of the fund and length of the program:
- Do not fund the program
- 1 cohort of 8 weeks (2 months) for a total fund size of $2.5 million
- 2 cohorts of 8 weeks each (4 months) for a total fund size of $5 million

Please review the proposal forum post for a full proposal description: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-unlock-arb-utility-and-align-governance/25084/1

### Abstract

We want to increase the transparency into the Orbit stack by aggregating important metrics on a chain level so that users, builders, and DAO members can make better data-driven decisions, including what revenue an Orbit chain generates. This allows to plan much better, for example around an Orbit liquidity plan or other discussions around Orbit chains and their current/future support, or even retroactive programs (through better historic and comparable data points). 

There is high likelyhood that the DAO will want to run an incentive program for Orbit Chains in the future. By having the data ready to go, we can avoid having a short-term program proposal which bootstraps data gathering. A 2% (low estimate) productivity increase on $50 million would have been $1 million. This proposal can likely pay for itself!

It will be in the form of a dedicated Arbitrum Orbit Stack page on [growthepie.xyz](http://growthepie.xyz/) having 20 chains listed with standardized metrics for each chain as well as an aggregated fundamental metrics view for the whole stack.

Brief background: This proposal has been created initially for the Arbitrum GovHack Brussels and was selected as one of the finalists. This version is an updated version, especially making sure that this proposal is understood as 
-	a start to have more usage analytics around Orbit chains
-	that the future process of data collection and onboarding of chains is streamlined
-	constantly iterated on to make the listings cheaper and more affordable/sustainable for upcoming (and potentially smaller, more niche) Orbit chains.

### Motivation

So far, there is no go-to place that provides an overview of Arbitrum Orbit. Standardized metrics allow a better idea of the performance and outlook of each chain being part of the Arbitrum Orbit. This results in greater transparency for all chains regarding their activity and how the usage of one chain compares to another.

Users can use this information to gather a quick overview of the Orbit ecosystem. Builders can use the different metrics to better track adoption, and DAO members can make more data-driven decisions on future initiatives (e.g., Orbit retrospective funding based on onchain contribution to the DAO).

Also, visibility for the overall Arbitrum Orbit stack is increased, and the whole Ethereum ecosystem can see what is going on in the Arbitrum ecosystem - where to be and interact, build, or allocate funding towards. Additionally, for DAO members and delegates, revenue and cost metrics provide future insight into how the Orbit approach should be developed to make it profitable for the DAO as well (includes more transparency into how much Orbit chains are paying to Arbitrum One).

This proposal is meant as a start for a long-term partnership to provide listing of Orbit chains long-term and on a recurring basis on growthepie. After the listing of the first setup and 20 initial chains, we would like to follow up with another AIP to enable listing of the 21st+ chain.

### Rationale

growthepie is an entirely public goods funded analytics platform for Ethereum scaling solutions. The AIP aligns closely with Arbitrum community’s mission and guiding values. At growthepie, Ethereum alignment is at the core of our existence, ensuring that our efforts contribute to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

We aim to enhance transparency, enabling data-driven decisions that are crucial for tracking outcomes and improving strategic decisions. All our code is open-source, allowing anyone to review and verify our metric logic. This openness fosters trust and ensures the integrity of our platform. We prioritize inclusivity by offering our platform and API completely free of charge, ensuring maximum accessibility for all users.

Our user-focused design philosophy centers on the needs of our diverse audience, making data easy to digest and actionable for all users. We uphold the values of neutrality and openness as we believe in the power of data to increase transparency and objectivity. All information on our platform is freely available, reinforcing our commitment to these principles.

### Specifications

growthepie has proven to be a platform for people wanting to understand the overall health, activity, and usage across the Ethereum scaling solutions ecosystem. Arbitrum One was listed as one of the first 5 chains from the beginning. Since then, Arbitrum members have used the platform to compare Arbitrum One with other Layer 2s, and we have provided reliable data and visualizations for Arbitrum’s community. Marketing has also used our charts to provide data-driven insights into the ecosystem and how Arbitrum One is growing, giving it more credibility.

Building on this, the Arbitrum Orbit should be given a dedicated place on growthepie with 20 chains listed in the beginning. This allows us to provide a mostly complete overview of the whole Arbitrum stack. This proposal is aimed at the start of a longer partnership. Hence, as part of this proposal, we will design and set up the initial pages and backend needed to onboard Orbit chains, aggregate fundamental metrics, and especially revenue metrics for each chain.

**Which Orbit chains will be considered among the 20 chains as part of this proposal?**
Every chain that is above $1 million TVL (Total Value Locked) at time of the listing decision, will be eligible to be listed as part of this proposal. Every chain that is below at the start of the listing process will not be considered. In case a chain falls below $1 million TVL in the future (after the listing decision had been made), the chain will stay on growthepie, however. The chain will not be delisted and available data will be presented as long as no official announcement by the chain's team has been made that the chain will be shut down. 

Each Orbit chain – as Arbitrum One and any other chain listed on growthepie – will have their own set of metrics (in the categories activity, value locked, economics, and convenience) and their own single chain page. Additionally, each chain will appear on each fundamental metrics page for which the specific metric is available.

**Stack view for an aggregated Arbitrum Orbit view**
On top of that, we will introduce a Stack view (new page) that provides a complete overview of the whole stack aggregated. This will be on a dedicated page which will enable users, builders, and DAO members solely interested in the Orbit to go to this place and learn more. See the prototype which includes:

* Leading chart that aggregates Layer 2s and/or Layer 3s together showing growth over time
* Table that lists all available Orbit chains on growthepie separated into Layer 2 and Layer 3
* Fundamental metrics section with the aggregated view of all chains combined in the Arbitrum Orbit

This set of views will make it possible to easily get an overview and see the growth of the whole Orbit ecosystem but also to compare certain Orbit chains against each other (or against other Layer 2s from other ecosystems).    

### Steps to Implement

Timeframe starting from the date of DAO proposal approval and weeks/months add up to each other. Total duration ~ 5 months. Chain listing time is also dependent on potential collaboration with an indexing provider and their speed of chain indexing.

### Overall Cost

The following cost are denominated in USD. The exact ARB amount will be determined closer to the onchain proposal date to reflect the US dollar ask. 

**Fix setup costs ($41,425.00 USD):**

* Design and implement general platform UX adjustments (more chains mean restructuring of UI elements and different filter logic)
* Designing and implementing frontend views: Orbit specific stack view, Single chain view (for each Orbit chain), Fundamentals view
* Data infra setup (RPCs, database execution)
* Metric aggregation & Logic: Activity (Transaction Count, Active Addresses – daily and monthly), Value locked (Stablecoin Market Cap, Total Value Locked), Economics (Revenue, Costs, Onchain Profit), plus Market Cap and Fully Diluted Valuation where applicable, Convenience metrics: Transaction Costs (median 1-day aggregation), DAO Contributions (how much back to ARB)

**Initial chain listings (20 Orbit chains in total) and maintenance for 1 year ($168,750.00 USD):**

* Integrate brand assets (icon, colors, etc.) for each chain
* Pull raw transaction data and store in our database
* Setup metric logic where applicable (e.g., bridge contracts for value locked, custom gas tokens, DA layer, settlement layer)
* Daily aggregation of all relevant datapoints
* Aggregated data / metrics available via API (for frontend and other data consumers)

**Requirement:** Arbitrum Foundation provides indexed data. If not, an additional cost for indexing will be added ($3,750.00 USD per chain)

**Recurring costs also cover:**

* Hosting frontend
* Maintenance backend / data pipelines
* Regular posts on social media about interesting developments (from data perspective)

**Total Costs: $210,175.00 USD**",bullish,0.5548,2024-08-08 22:30:50+00:00,0.5907,0.5907,2024-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,6.47080028839222,0.57735,0.0406452775775055,0.9015314280986786,True," The proposal considers 20 Orbit chains with a TVL of over $1 million at the time of listing decision. These chains will have their own set of metrics in categories like activity, value locked, economics, and convenience, and will appear on fundamental metrics pages where applicable. A new Stack view will be introduced for a complete overview of the whole Orbit ecosystem, including a leading chart that aggregates Layer 2s and/or Layer 3s, a table listing all available Orbit chains, and a fundamental metrics section with an aggregated view of all chains combined in the Arbitrum Orbit.

The implementation timeline is approximately 5 months from DAO proposal approval, with chain listing time dependent on collaboration with an indexing provider. The total cost for this project is estimated to be $210,175 USD, including fix setup costs of $41,425 USD and initial chain listings and maintenance for 1 year at $168,750 USD. Additional costs may apply if Arbitrum Foundation does not provide indexed data, in which case an additional cost of $3,750 USD per chain will be added. The recurring costs cover hosting frontend, maintenance backend/data pipelines, and regular social media posts about interesting developments from a data perspective.",bullish,small

155,299,603,603,603,2023-11-11 17:35:07+00:00,arbitrum,"Abstract:
This Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) is presented with the vision of further enhancing the Arbitrum ecosystem following the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). Acknowledging the STIP’s instrumental role in the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, this proposal seeks to extend its positive impact by introducing a gas rebate and trading incentive program created by Rage Trade, a native perp aggregator on Arbitrum. Through this initiative, we aspire to not only complement the milestones achieved by the STIP but also to significantly increase the influx of new traders into the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Motivation:
As the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) kicks off, it sets the stage for the Arbitrum ecosystem to experience amplified growth. The STIP is poised to play a pivotal role in promoting on-chain activities and reinforcing key protocols. However, there is plenty of opportunity to intensify user engagement and participation, especially when considering innovative platforms like Rage Trade.

This proposal is driven by the ambition to harness this potential, acting synergistically with the anticipated successes of the STIP. Through Rage Trade’s introduction of a gas rebate and trading incentive program, our objective is not just to elevate trading activity, but also to enhance the overall user experience, attracting and onboarding new traders to the ecosystem. This effort is geared towards empowering platforms that, in line with Arbitrum’s vision, are poised for growth but require additional support to maximize their contribution.

Rationale:

This proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s mission to foster a dynamic and engaged community. By allocating 100% of the grant funds to create a gas rebate and trading incentives program, Rage Trade’s platform aims to refine the user experience of traders while offering gas savings and trading incentives to stimulate a competitive yet cooperative environment.

Specifications: A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.
Rage Trade Platform:

As a prime broker and perpetual aggregator, Rage Trade unifies top decentralized perpetual exchanges across all EVM-compatible chains. It streamlines the trading experience by eliminating complexities associated with collateral and gas fund management, ensuring a faster, more efficient, and user-friendly environment for traders.

Gas Tank Mechanism:

The Gas Tank is a unique feature of Rage Trade that simplifies trading across different chains. Users deposit funds into their account, and a portion goes into the Gas Tank. This fund is then used to cover gas fees across various chains, eliminating the need for users to manage gas fees separately.

Session-Based Trading System:

Rage Trade employs a session-based trading system where users create a session that lasts for a specified duration (e.g., 7 days). This system reduces the need for manual transaction signing, making the trading experience smoother and more akin to centralized exchanges.

Multi-Leg Trading and Auto-Populating Bridge:

The platform allows users to create multiple trades from different chains and perps on Arbitrum, enabling them to spread risk and optimize execution. Additionally, Rage Trade handles all the bridging details, automatically selecting the best bridge or swap routes for seamless trade execution.

Custom Route Selection:

Users have the option to split their orders based on various criteria such as best execution price, lowest funding fees, or routes with bonuses like emissions or airdrops. This feature provides flexibility and optimization for trade execution.

Aggregated Referral & Competitions:

Rage Trade aggregates referrals and competitions across different perp protocols, allowing users to participate in various trading competitions and referral programs through a single platform.

Incentive Distribution:

The proposal involves the distribution of 1.5 million ARB tokens to incentivize trading volume on Rage Trade. The distribution will be structured to reward active traders and participants in trading competitions, fostering increased engagement and liquidity on the platform.

Trading Competitions:

A series of trading competitions will be organized, with ARB tokens allocated as prizes. These competitions aim to attract traders, boost trading volume, and create a vibrant trading community on Rage Trade.

User Engagement and Performance Metrics:
Rage Trade has successfully cultivated a dynamic user base, boasting 70,000 active traders who regularly engage with our platform. This robust participation is a testament to our platform’s appeal and functionality within the trading community.

In addition to our active traders, we have nurtured a strong Liquidity Provider (LP) community, with 26,000 LPs contributing to our ecosystem. This substantial number of LPs underscores our platform’s reliability and the trust placed in us by those who provide liquidity, further cementing our role as a pivotal player in the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Overall, our protocol’s historical performance not only demonstrates significant growth and adoption but also highlights our consistent delivery of value to our users, traders, and liquidity providers. These metrics are indicative of our integral position within the Arbitrum ecosystem and our potential to further enhance and expand our offerings with sustained support.

Rage’s Perpetual Performance:

Rage Trade v1 has experienced a remarkable market reception, evidenced by a staggering $735M in Total Trading Volume against Rage’s Total Value Locked (TVL). This impressive figure reflects the high demand and active engagement within our user base, showcasing the platform’s appeal and effectiveness.



962×642 21.9 KB
Rage’s Vaults Performance:

Our vault offerings, including the 80-20 Tricrypto Vault and GLP Vault, have achieved a notable peak TVL of approximately $19.87 million (at 100% max capacity since launch). This achievement highlights the trust and confidence users place in our vault products.

At its peak, Rage Trade accounted for about 1.4% of the entire Arbitrum TVL, marking our significant contribution to the overall ecosystem. This percentage represents our substantial impact and the value we add to the broader Arbitrum community.

The 80-20 Tricrypto vault, in particular, has demonstrated exceptional performance. Over its 10-month lifespan, it outperformed holding GLP by 8%. Specifically, from July 2022 to April 2023, the 80-20 Tricrypto vault yielded a 44% return compared to a 36% return from merely holding GLP, showcasing its effectiveness and profitability.

Steps to Implement: The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.
To implement this proposal, we will follow a structured approach, ensuring each phase contributes effectively to the overall goal. Here’s how we plan to proceed:

Data Reporting and Transparency: Rage Trade is committed to transparency and will implement Dune dashboards for real-time tracking of all relevant metrics. These dashboards will ensure community members have access to up-to-date data, reflecting our progress and adherence to the commitments outlined in this proposal. This approach emphasizes our dedication to transparency and accountability within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Incentive Allocation: We will begin by using a portion of the ARB tokens for our gas rebate program to offset gas fees for our users. This will serve as the initial spark to ignite trading activities on the Rage Trade platform.

Fee Offset & Trading Competitions: We will then allocate the remaining tokens to incentivize trading, including trade competitions and offsetting fees implemented by integrated perp protocols. The trading competitions will be strategically scheduled over time to ensure ongoing participation and interest.

Regular Updates and Reporting: Throughout the implementation, we will continuously monitor platform performance, trader engagement, and community feedback. This will allow us to make real-time adjustments and improvements where necessary. To maintain transparency, we will provide the community with regular updates and reports. These will include key performance metrics and insights gained from the implementation process.

Review and Analysis: At the end of the implementation phase, we will conduct a thorough review. This will involve analyzing successes, identifying areas for improvement, and extracting key learnings for future initiatives.

By following these steps, we aim to ensure not just the successful implementation of the proposal but also to contribute valuable insights for the continuous growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Timeline: Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.
The implementation of this proposal is structured into a 4-month period, with each month focusing on specific objectives and milestones:

Month 1 - Initiation and Setup (Immediately upon approval):

Allocation of ARB tokens to the designated multisig wallet to immediately initiate gas rebates and trading fee offsets. Setup of the Dune dashboard for tracking key metrics such as trading volume and unique traders. Announcement of the initiative and upcoming trading competitions to the community.

Month 2 - Launch of Trading Competitions:

Official launch of the first set of trading competitions.

Active monitoring of trading activities and engagement levels.

First monthly update provided to the community, highlighting early results and trader participation.

Month 3 - Mid-term Review and Adjustments:

Comprehensive review of the first two months, analyzing trader engagement and competition outcomes.

Adjustments made to competitions and incentives based on feedback and data analysis.

Second monthly update provided, including insights and any changes implemented.

Month 4 - Final Push and Comprehensive Analysis:

Continued incentivization and promotion of trading activities.

Final monthly update provided, leading up to the comprehensive quarterly report.

Preparation of the detailed analysis report, evaluating the proposal’s success based on predefined objectives.

Post-4-Month Period - Evaluation and Reporting:

Release of a comprehensive quarterly report, detailing the overall impact of the proposal on trading volume, trader engagement, and growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Evaluation of the initiative’s success and consideration of potential future actions based on the outcomes.

This timeline ensures a structured approach to implementing the proposal, with regular updates and transparency. It allows for adjustments based on real-time data and community feedback, ensuring the initiative remains aligned with its goal of driving growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

To measure the success of achieving the grant objectives, we will focus on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Daily Volume: Aiming for a 30-day moving average of $10M in daily volume.
Daily Traders: Targeting a 30-day moving average of 300 unique traders.
Integration: Committing to integrate 1 or more perpetual DEXes per 2 weeks (accounting for audit time).
These KPIs will serve as benchmarks to gauge our progress and effectiveness in utilizing the grant to drive growth and engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Grant Breakdown:
Rage Trade aims to leverage the grant to attract a substantial influx of users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, bolstering user interaction, transaction volume, TVL, and overall activity.

Strategically, Rage Trade will allocate ~ 33% of the grant to gas rebates, with the other ~ 66% of the grant being directed towards offsetting integrated perp protocols’ trading fees and various trading competitions. The endgame is to amplify user onboarding and trading enthusiasm, resonating with genuine market dynamics.

It’s crucial to clarify that rebate rates will be determined by the genuine fees incurred by users. If our partnering protocols grant separate rebates or rewards, Rage Trade commits to ensuring that the total sum of rebates will never surpass the fees accrued. Throughout this promotional phase, trade-to-earn schemes will not be entertained. Additionally, the Rage Trade team will vigilantly deter and counteract wash trading and Sybil-attack incidents. Offending addresses linked with such activities will be publicly disclosed and denied the associated rebates.

Gas Rebates Explained:
Once a week, traders will receive ARB tokens as a gas rebate, mirroring the gas fees they’ve incurred throughout the week. This rebate system ensures that users can trade more freely, knowing a portion of their gas fees will be returned. The gas rebate will be uniformly applied across all protocols integrated with Rage Trade on Arbitrum, ensuring fairness and consistency for all traders. The rebate amount a trader receives will be directly proportional to the actual gas fees they’ve paid, eliminating any potential for manipulative practices like trade-to-earn schemes.

Fee Rebates Explained:

ARB tokens will be rewarded as fee rebates to our traders every Friday, reflecting the fees they’ve accumulated over the week.

This fee waiver will be consistently applied across all collaborating protocols.

Traders’ rebate entitlements will strictly correlate with their actual trading fees, nullifying the chance for trade-to-earn practices. The rate of expenditure from the grant will be contingent on the volume of organic trading transpiring each week. The Rage Trade team pledges to continually identify and thwart wash trading and sybil-attack attempts.

To safeguard the integrity of the campaign, the specifics of the anti-wash-trading & anti-sybil-attack measures will be kept confidential and will be communicated post-event, mirroring best practices employed in protocol airdrop launches.

Example of Fee Structure Post-Reduction:

If additional perps trading mechanisms in the Arbitrum realm are incorporated with Rage Trade amidst this campaign, the fee waiver will extend to those as well.

Integrated protocol trading fee rates before and after reduction

GMX V1: 0.1% → 0%

GMX V2: 0.05% / 0.07% → 0%

Overall Cost: The total cost to implement the AIP.
The total cost to implement this AIP for Rage Trade is 1.5M ARB tokens. This cost is solely dedicated to funding trading competitions and volume incentives on the Rage Trade platform. The breakdown is as follows:

Gas Rebates: 500k ARB tokens will be allocated for offsetting gas fees when trading perps on Arbitrum.

Trading Fee Rebates & Competitions: The remaining 1m ARB will be used as trading fee offsets and trading competitions.

There are no additional costs involved in this proposal.

We introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*

## **Motivation**

This proposal represents an improved version compared to previous initiatives and requests for comments (RFCs):

- [[RFC-2] Delegate Incentive System for ArbitrumDAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-2-delegate-incentive-system-for-arbitrumdao/15720)
- [[DRAFT] Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/draft-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/16501)

We have developed this new proposal considering the comments and observations provided by other delegates. Our additional motivation lies in the recent increase in proposals and increased activity within ArbitrumDAO. We believe that delegates are the core base of the DAO and should be properly incentivized to maintain active participation, both in voting and feedback on proposals and in the ideation of governance processes.

# **Delegate Incentive System**

## **Before reading the proposal, note how we have decided to structure it**

This proposal is structured into four main sections:

* **Option 1:** This is our main proposal detailing all the specifications of the incentive system.
* **Option 2:** Introduces the implementation of ""Karma"" to automate certain processes. It's important to note that this option entails additional costs.
* **General Summary:** An overview of the proposed items.
* **Next Steps:** Voting deadline

# **Option 1 - Main Proposal**

# Specifications

## Duration of the Incentive System

We've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.

## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives

We have set the number at **50 delegates**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a reasonable starting point.

## Funding

- Incentives for delegates: 1,500,000 ARB
- Incentive Program Administrator: 25,000 ARB

## Delegate Selection Process

Based on the feedback received, we've opted for a single tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:

* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).
* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.
* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).
* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%

> **Note:**
> * So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated
> * The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.
> * Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:

### Incentive Program Application

Delegates matching the requirements must confirm their participation in the Incentive System in the forum (a dedicated channel will be established for this). They must post using the template provided below, within a 7-day application window.

**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**
* Forum Username (Link):
* Twitter Profile (Link):
* Snapshot Profile (Link):
* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):

> **Note:**
> * Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.
> * Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.

**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**

## Scoring and Framework

To determine which delegates will be paid on a monthly basis, we will use a point system and a framework that will be made public.

![scores.png](ipfs://bafybeieuu4yypwmkapdkznz4arvsci7t7ond4a7qh55us2fuz5ijjbhwsa)
    
[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)

### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas

We explain in detail the framework and points system:

* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives
* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power
* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment
* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.
  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. This parameter is extracted from Tally. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.
    * **PR% formula: (PR * 20) / 100**
  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.
    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.
    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.
    * **SV% formula: (SV(Tn) /SV(Fn)) * 15**
  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.
    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.
    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.
    * **TV% formula: (TV(Fn) - TV(Rn)) * 25**
  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.
    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.
    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.
    * **CR% formula: (CR(Fn) - CR(Rn)) * 25**
  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.
    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.
    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.
    * **CP% formula: (CP(Fn) - CP(Rn)) * 15**
  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month

* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.
  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**
* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.
  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 * TP% / 100))**

#### Parameter summary

* **Activity Weight (%):**
  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**
  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**
  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**
  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**
  * **Commenting on Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**
  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**
* **Total Participation (TP):**
  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**

### Weight and activity considerations

The activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.

We have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.

**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**

> **Note:**
> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.


### Total Participation (TP)

The 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.

Should more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.

If fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated

> **Note:**
> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.

### Bonus Point

Should a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.

We understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions

- Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?
- Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?
- Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?
- Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).
- Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no? 

When evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.

### Parameter Snapshot

When we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.

### Delegate Responsibilities

Delegates are responsible for keeping track of their actions. At the end of the month, they have until the 3rd of the following month to submit a forum post with the following requirements:

* A copy (Link) of the framework with their activity data for that month.
* Additionally, the post must have a summary with all the links including:
  * Snapshot voting link
  * Forum post link explaining the reasoning behind the snapshot vote
  * Tally voting link
  * Forum post link explaining the tally vote reasoning (if you have changed your vote)
  * Commenting on Proposals link (only those that went to snapshots)
* The summary should also include:
  * Delegate proposal links
  * Links to any significant contribution (discussion, questions, suggestions, etc.) made to a proposal.

> **Note:**
> * Delegates failing to post the requested information will not receive incentives.
> * To avoid forum spam and disarray, we will ask the facilitators to add a channel for the incentive system so delegates can input all their information there.

### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities

After the delegates post and present their results in the framework, the incentive system administrator has 10 days to gather all the information, review, verify, and unify it. Then, present all the unified data on the forum in the [framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862) and attach a summary explaining that month's final result.

Once the final result is presented, delegates have 2 days to file a claim in case of disagreement.

#### Dispute

Delegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.

To raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:

* Title: Dispute
* Username
* Reason for dispute (be detailed)

The system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.

#### Incentive System Ban

Should a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.

We must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success. 

### Payment Execution

If all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be sent as a proposal to Tally, with full details of the payments, between the 16th and 17th. This will be repeated for the 6 months, so that the DAO has control over the incentive program and can cut it off whenever it wants.

**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**

#### Considerations

Like every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).

Estimated schedule:

![schedule.png](ipfs://bafkreie7nlxyh7jx7myxgfj6eqogu6p7kfebmokq3v5fvxzskmmb7j2h64)
    
### Administrator Perspective

1. Start of the month: Track delegate participation in governance.
2. Last day of the month: Begin collecting delegate posts from the forum.
3. Review all the information, check for accuracy, and compile it into the framework.
4. Establish the results within the given timeframe.
5. If everyone agrees, send a proposal to Tally with the payment details, to be voted on.
6. Keep the DAO informed

## Incentive system administrator

Given the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the adminstration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.

However, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.

For the adminstration of said program the budget would be 25,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator.

# **Option 2 - Karma automation for delegate incentive program**

### Features summary

Karma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. The features that will be built include:

1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.
2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.
3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.
**Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**
4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.
5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.

**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**

### Timeline

- **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.
- **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features
- **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.
- **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.

### Payment Schedule

- **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.
- **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)
- **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)

**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**

### Cost

- 30000 ARB


## **SEED Latam Commitment**

Seed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.

As with Option 1, we are also open to having a group of delegates or potentially a third party administer Karma's progress and the program, in which case we would obviously provide all necessary assistance.

For the administration of the program for this option the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator. 

### Disclaimer

SEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.

The only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Related Discussion: Our proposal is similar to [Voltz Additional Use Grant](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/should-uniswap-provide-voltz-with-v3-additional-use-grant/15669)

### What is Rage Trade?

[Rage Trade](https://rage.trade) is a new perpetual swap  protocol built using Uniswap v3. Many on-chain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs. However, traders and LPs benefit from v3’s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp.

### Why do we need an additional use grant?

Our proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol. Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3’s code but instead we have built on top of it. Think of Uniswap as our matching engine, and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading. We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswap’s core: leverage trading, leverage LPing, cross-margin, liquidations, and real time funding rates. 

### What changes have we made that require additional use?

We have built libraries to enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates. Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswap’s BUSL protect code (that we require an additional grants use for):

- [SimulateSwap](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/SimulateSwap.sol): This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage. It makes use of Uniswap’s TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries.
- [TickBitmapExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickBitmapExtended.sol): This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswap's TickBitmap, required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract.
- [TickExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickExtended.sol): This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade. They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3.
- [LiquidityPosition](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/LiquidityPosition.sol#L5): This library enables leverage liquidity providing (and the accompanying margin logic). It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so.


 ### How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap?

1. Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3: Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 (not a fork) all additional TVL + trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3.

2. Rage Trade will spend significant R&D resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie: Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 80-20 strategy that composes with Curve’s tricrypto.

3. Liquid & composable on-chain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies: Using perps, Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging. Additionally multi-collateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market.

Rage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswap’s value as a protocol.

The proposal to deploy Uniswap on Redstone has completed the 7-day RFC phase. All contracts have been deployed and verified. This deployment has therefore been optimistically approved by the Uni DAO. We will now turn to a temperature check to vote on whether or not the DAO would like to employ the Uniswap Onboarding Package to help incentivize Uniswap pools on Redstone. This vote also includes a veto option, allowing any delegates who hold a dissenting opinion to veto this deployment altogether.

* Redstone will not be providing any incentive matching, nor will they be bootstrapping liquidity on their end.

## Onboarding Package:
The purpose of the Uniswap Onboarding Package is to allow new deployments of Uniswap v3 to get set up with three months’ worth of liquidity incentives, a frontend, and an incentive distribution tool like Merkl. These resources will help position Uniswap to have a formidable presence on new EVM chains.

### Criteria for Package Adoption:
This off-chain vote will be used to determine how much in incentives–if any–the DAO would like to allocate to this deployment. The options are as follows:

* Incentivize $250k
* Incentivize $500k
* Incentivize $750k
* Incentivize $1M
* Deploy without incentives
* Veto this deployment altogether

This temp check will be considered met as long as the total number of votes cast for the funding options is over >10M. If there isn't a clear winner for which level of incentives the chain should receive, a discussion can be had before the onchain proposal. All incentives will be distributed to LPs in terms of $UNI on the target chain.

## Further Details:

* Incentivized pools will primarily be blue chips like wETH-USDC–and any local pools if applicable. The onchain vote will include the final details for pool info.
* The Accountability Committee will escrow the inflight incentives.
* The DAO will not be using the funds from this vote for front-end integration and maintenance since Redstone has covered this cost.
* Angle Merkl will be paid for incentive distribution. The fixed integration cost going to Merkl for this deployment is €20k.
* Angle Merkl charges 3% on incentives distributed with their system. They have offered a 25% discount on their base 3% fee for incentives distributed between $2.5m-$5m, a 50% discount on incentives distributed between $5m-$10m, and a 75% discount on all incentives above $10m in a 365-day period. The Accountability Committee will be responsible for ensuring that the DAO attains properly discounted rates.
  * Example scenario: if $500k of incentives are voted in, and the Merkl take rate is 3%, then the grand total that’ll be requested from the DAO during the onchain vote will be $500k + $15k + €20k = ~536,664",bullish,7.003,2024-05-13 09:51:09+00:00,7.445,7.445,2024-05-15 00:00:00+00:00,6.3115807511066695,7.0755,0.01035270598315,0.922562301158905,True," The Uniswap deployment on Redstone has been approved and a vote is now being held to decide whether to employ the Uniswap Onboarding Package for liquidity incentives. The package includes three months of liquidity incentives, a frontend, and an incentive distribution tool like Merkl. The DAO can choose to allocate varying amounts of funds or veto the deployment altogether. If passed, the vote will determine the level of incentives, ranging from $250k to $1M, with no incentives as an option. The vote requires over 10M votes and will be considered valid if there is a clear winner for the level of incentives. Incentivized pools will primarily consist of blue chips like wETH-USDC. Merkl will handle incentive distribution and charge a fee, with potential discounts based on the amount of incentives distributed. The Accountability Committee will manage the funds and ensure proper discounted rates are obtained from Merkl.",bullish,small

We [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to initiate the deployment of Uniswap v3 onto the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), a programmable EMV-compatible environment built over the Filecoin blockchain and its robust system of decentrally stored data. Considering Filecoin is the de facto storage provider in the blockchain space, it is valuable for Uniswap to attain market share in its data economy early on. We therefore believe that an FVM deployment is an opportune manner by which Uniswap’s multichain vision is furthered.

One of the reasons that peer to peer storage systems like IPFS are difficult to maintain is because the parties involved in the network are not incentivized to expend resources to maintain the integrity of the stored data. Decentralization is not an inherent method for providing a superior storage product. That is why Filecoin was created. The Filecoin blockchain’s economic incentive structure between storage providers (SPs) and users creates a market for SPs to store and maintain data integrity over time. However, the robustness of that data economy must also be high for sustaining data storage in the long run. If SPs, for instance, do not have access to creatively expand their service provision business or efficiently put their capital to work, then their incentive to partake in the Filecoin/IPFS system is reduced. 

The FVM’s launch on March 14, 2023 effectively made Filecoin programmable through the introduction of smart contracts. Programmability allows for the creation of dapps that work in tandem with the stored data. If an ecosystem of, say, DeFi applications can be built on the FVM to supplement the efforts of SPs, then the data economy is strengthened many fold. Invariably, DEXs are a rudimentary building block of a crypto economy, and just as they enable higher degrees of liquidity for numerous L1s, they will be able to provide a similar facility for Filecoin’s data economy. Uniswap would, for instance, grant SPs the ability to swap between $FIL tokens that they earn as a reward for providing their services.

## A Primer on Filecoin

### Filecoin, IPFS, and Storage Helpers

Filecoin is the premier decentralized storage protocol built on top of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The two entities are distinct but often incorrectly conflated as one. Although Protocol Labs founded–and continues to aid in the development of–both Filecoin and IPFS, the two systems serve distinct purposes. IPFS is not a blockchain but a set of modular data addressing and networking protocols. Using IPFS, files are fragmented, hashed, and distributed amongst numerous nodes. Data distribution in a network of SPs around the world makes the system more secure than a centralized cloud storage system. Centralized servers reduce the control an individual has over their data and increases the surface area for information exploits. The hashed nature of the data allows for a secure manner of locating files using a technique known as content-addressing, which differs from the traditional location-addressing method (HTTP) used by most of the Internet. Even though data on IPFS are stored off-chain (i.e. on hardware devices), they are secure due to the combination of content-addressing and a verifiable zk-proof system present on Filecoin.

IPFS’ system allows for enterprise data centers to pledge their idle network resources like bandwidth and disk drive to secure others’ data. Such a storage system, however, does not function effectively without an incentive structure in place. Monetarily rewarding the entities involved in the file storage and retrieval processes enables the creation of a micro economy, where storage providers (SPs) are paid by users to store their data. Filecoin is the blockchain-based economic layer built on top of IPFS that allows for the exchange of $FIL tokens between SPs and users. Without Filecoin’s incentive structure, the storage provision capabilities of IPFS would not function or scale. Filecoin also allows for the development of a competitive data storage market, where storage prices are more attractive than those issued by incumbent centralized SPs like AWS or Microsoft Azure. By tapping the long tail of data centers, costs for storage, compute, and retrieval can be brought dramatically below the cloud incumbents.

Data storage and retrieval is also simplified through the help of third-party storage helpers. These entities aid in abstracting away much of the protocol’s dealmaking complexities between SPs and users. Instead of interacting directly with Filecoin and IPFS, developers can leverage storage helpers’ API services. Dapps can therefore receive decentralized storage benefits without much hassle. This is one of the reasons why the active number of deals, including those from [Filecoin Plus](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus/), rose from [~16M to ~33M](https://observablehq.com/@starboard/chart-daily-active-deal-count-statistics) in 2023 alone. A notable storage helper called NFT.storage allows anybody using NFTs to decentrally store and retrieve their NFT metadata and images on IPFS and Filecoin. Used by platforms like OpenSea and Magic Eden, the helper has experienced over [122M total uploads, accounting for 304.13 TB of data on Filecoin](https://nft.storage/stats/).

### Proof of Storage

SPs are only paid when they submit two types of cryptographic proofs to the Filecoin protocol: Proof of Replication (PoRep) & Proof of Spacetime (PoSt). Collectively, these two proofs can be thought of as a means by which storage is proved. PoRep is initially conducted upon the SP receiving the users data, and it requires the SP to generate a public proof signifying that the hashed data is securely stored and replicated on a hardware device. It is a way to make sure that SP does not lie about the fact that they are storing the given data. PoSt is a process that occurs every 24 hours–it requires SPs to prove that a designated parcel of data is still stored (space) and able to be retrieved by the user whenever they desire (time). Daily spacetime proofs allow for the protocol to ensure data continuity. Currently, the network maintains [12.11 EiBs](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/capacity-services) of storage space, provided by [over 4,000 SPs](https://medium.com/tldrfilecoin/state-and-direction-of-filecoin-summarized-4b90c59e3cca).

## The Filecoin Virtual Machine

### How the FVM is Enabling a Data Economy

Due to the V18 Hygge Filecoin network upgrade in March 2023, smart contract programmability was introduced to the Filecoin blockchain. The FVM is a WASM-based execution environment that has the potential to enable programmable markets for storage, retrieval, compute, and Filecoin subnets, each catering to a new custom service. Foreign runtimes like the EVM are able to function on top of the FVM, allowing for developers to seamlessly program applications on Filecoin. Over time, multiple runtime environments will be introduced to the FVM, but the primary runtime that is currently available is the EVM. Solidity programmers can therefore utilize familiar tools like Hardhat, Foundry, Truffle, and Metamask to create EVM-based dapps on Filecoin, with the Filecoin complexities being abstracted from the developers’ purview. And so, with the incorporation of smart contracts, Filecoin is addressing the L1 market from the vantage point of actually being able to store users’ data; most other blockchains simply do not have the simultaneous storage capabilities and programmability.

Support for numerous VMs will enable FVM to better interact with alternative L1s and increase liquidity transmission between previously siloed chains. Programs deployed on the EVM, MoveVM, JS/SES, or any other VMs will be able to fork onto the FVM. This proposal seeks to create a fork of the Uniswap v3 code and deploy it on the FEVM.

The FVM’s goal is to harbor a robust data economy, and this can be accomplished by launching various services, enabled by smart contract development. Below are some examples: 

***Perpetual Storage:*** Applications that allow for the automatic renewal of a deal between a client and the SPs, allowing for a continuous, long-term storage agreement that requires minimal manual intervention on behalf of the client. 

***Data DAOs:*** The FVM does not have direct access to the underlying data, but it does allow for that data to be governed. DAOs can be created around a dataset, accessible by a consortium of individuals as opposed to a single entity. Token-gated structures can also allow for better dataset access controls, like determining which entities can read, write, or read+write to a dataset. 

***Data Monetization:*** Data can also be tokenized, where certain tokens stand for a portion of a dataset, prescribing a market-determined value to the data underlying the respective tokens. This way, data itself can be collateralized and traded. Users of certain applications can also monetize their data by selling their profile NFTs, which give access to underlying consumer data, to marketing or analytics agencies.

***DeFi:*** A crypto economy is not complete without basic financial applications like DEXs and lending protocols. The “Proposal Motivation” section underscores why DEXs like Uniswap are important. Below are more examples of DeFi initiatives in the crypto data economy. Each of these has the ability to further enhance Uniswap’s position on Filecoin by routing liquidity between these various applications.

One example of a DeFi function is staking. Just like Lido and Rocket Pool allow ETH holders to secure the Ethereum blockchain without running a validator node with high computational and economic fixed costs, a similar model can be applied to Filecoin. A liquid staking protocol on FVM can therefore establish a profit-sharing system between SPs and $FIL holders. An alternative means for SPs to gather more $FIL for collateral purposes is by borrowing the $FIL from a lending protocol–of course, such dapps can also be built on the FVM. Token-gated features on lending dapps can also be enabled to allow for cost-effective $FIL borrowing. If an SP, for instance, has built a track record of reliable data storage with no slashing history, they can be issued an NFT by the lending protocol that gives the SP access to undercollateralized $FIL loans. Since larger amounts of data and longer storage periods require more $FIL, it is important to have seamless access to the token. This example illustrates the utilization of both DeFi and identity on the FVM.

Lending platforms and staking protocols are simply incomplete without a DEX like Uniswap. So, to provide actors in the Filecoin ecosystem with a place to easily swap between assets like $FIL and $stFIL (this asset doesn’t exist yet–just an example), there must be an AMM present. Other creative applications can also be built using Uniswap in the backend for automated asset swaps; the opportunities are very expansive.

### Ecosystem Development

Since storage is a vital part of every project, Filecoin has attracted clients of all colors from both the crypto native and web2 world. [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), a public repository of data from documents and websites to movies and songs, utilizes Filecoin to safeguard its information. The [USC Shoah Foundation](https://sfi.usc.edu/about) also leverages Filecoin to store important historical accounts about genocides like the Holocaust. As for other blockchains, Filecoin is used by various L1s and L2s for data storage, largely through storage helpers like NFT.storage.

As of Q1 2023, the Filecoin ecosystem has [484 projects](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q1-2023), with a trend of initiatives surpassing the initial project phase and into the accelerator stage and beyond. The Filecoin Foundation recently hosted a hackathon called [Space Warp](https://spacewarp.fvm.dev/#ie) containing over $400k of prizes and accelerator grants for promising projects building on the FVM. This was one of the initiatives to bootstrap the FVM ecosystem. Nearly two months after the FEVM’s launch, there have been [808 contracts deployed](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) with over [130k transactions](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) on the platform. Active contract users have also increased [184.5%](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) since April 1st. Such activity is revitalizing the condition of Filecoin from a stance of developer interest. Over the next few months smart contract deployment is projected to increase heavily, a large shift from the past two years, during which the Filecoin [active developer count fell by 11%](http://developerreport.com).

Overall, it is evident that the Filecoin Foundation, Protocols Labs, and their partners are aggregating resources to attract more users to the FVM. The growth thus far has been strong–but it is too early to call it a success. This Uniswap deployment, however, will certainly be another method to attract both developers and users to the FVM.

## Timeline

This proposal has passed the RFC phase without contention. The current temperature check is purposed for assessing the DAO’s desire to deploy on the FVM. If this Snapshot passes, we will commence the finalization of the relevant stakeholders mentioned in the RFC. The temp check is only measuring the community's desire to deploy on the FVM--it is not a vote on the stakeholder list. Stakeholder debates are to take place here on the Uniswap Forums. After the community is content with the stakeholders and has shown a desire to deploy on the FVM (decided by the temp check), the v3 contracts will be deployed on the destination chain. Thereafter, an onchain vote will commence as soon as the contracts have been audited.",bullish,4.3,2023-06-12 20:10:40+00:00,4.522,4.522,2023-06-13 00:00:00+00:00,5.16279069767442,4.347,0.0109302325581394,0.8433151543140411,True,"1. The article discusses the potential for a liquid staking protocol and DeFi applications on Filecoin's Future State Virtual Machine (FVM). This would allow FIL holders to participate in the network without running a full node, similar to Rocket Pool and Summair on Ethereum.

2. A profit-sharing system between Storage Providers (SPs) and FIL holders could be established through this liquid staking protocol. SPs could also borrow FIL from lending protocols for collateral purposes, with token-gated features allowing cost-effective FIL borrowing for reliable SPs.

3. An Automated Market Maker (AMM) like Uniswap would be crucial for easy asset swaps within the Filecoin ecosystem, enabling actors to swap between assets such as FIL and stFIL (hypothetical).

4. The article highlights several projects using Filecoin, including Internet Archive and the USC Shoah Foundation, for data storage. It also mentions that as of Q1 2023, there are 484 projects in the Filecoin ecosystem, with many moving beyond initial phases into accelerator stages.

5. The Filecoin Foundation hosted a hackathon called Space Warp to boost the FVM ecosystem. Since the FEVM's launch, there have been 808 contracts deployed and over 130k transactions on the platform, indicating growing developer interest.

6. The article concludes that the Filecoin Foundation, Protocol Labs, and their partners are working to attract more users to the FVM. A community temperature check is being conducted to gauge the desire to deploy on the FVM, with further discussions on relevant stakeholders taking place on the Uniswap Forums. If the community shows a desire to deploy on the FVM, v3 contracts will be deployed on the destination chain, followed by an on-chain vote after auditing.",bullish,small

Summary
In cooperation with DMA Labs (a major contributor to ICHI’s Uniswap v3 management protocols (https://www.ichi.org/)) and support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap 15, we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap v3 to Boba Network.
Boba Network is a blockchain Layer 2 scaling solution and Hybrid Compute (https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2022/07/boba-networks-hybrid-compute-why-it-will-unlock-blockchains-true-potential) platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees anywhere from 40-100x less than the respective Layer 1. Boba’s Hybrid Compute brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today.
In addition, Boba Network is the first and only multichain (https://www.theblock.co/post/149837/ethereum-layer-2-boba-network-integrates-with-fantom-and-moonbeam) Layer 2, deploying on leading Layer 1 chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and Moonbeam. Deploying on Boba will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Boba multichain ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.
The timeline for deployment will be approximately 3-4 weeks following the Governance Proposal, with contract deployment being handled by the Boba Network team.

Proposal
We believe there are many benefits for the Uniswap Protocol, some of which include:
Ethereum equivalence. Developer tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Boba Network. A trustless bridge architecture to bridge assets from Ethereum to the Boba Network L2 has been in place since mainnet launch, with many bridging partners extending our bridge capabilities, such as Across.to, Synapse, Multichain and Layerswap.

Low cost transactions with high security. As an Ethereum L2, Boba Network relies on Ethereum’s strong base layer security while providing very low cost transactions, with fees anywhere from 40-100x less than Ethereum.

Details for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3
Boba Network will provide $1M $BOBA tokens to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network. The tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet co-owned by the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Boba Network, who will work to deploy the funds as follows:
The incentives should be designed together with other projects which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as ICHI, Perpetual Protocol, Paraswap, or 1inch. The $BOBA can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3, should be supported. The goal is to deploy the $1M in the time period of one year. Funds not used after two years would go back to Boba. The spending is limited to $1M - the transferred amount of $BOBA as part of the proposal. Boba Network can decide to increase this amount based on the outcome of this initiative. In addition to this, Boba Network has already contributed more than $4M of liquidity on Uniswap v3 to bootstrap the initial success of Uniswap v3 on the Boba Network.

Security
Boba Network is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 and L1. Users can relay messages themselves. The security of the messages passed is secured within the rollup protocol. Bridging and sequencing transactions is based on Optimism’s Optimistic Rollup codebase. From L1 to L2, users need to trigger the CanonicalTransactionChain contract on L1 to create a new block on Boba Network. Our Sequencer is then forced to include the transaction on L2. From L2 to L1: Making provable statements about the state of Boba requires a cryptographic commitment in the form of the root of the Boba's state trie to a smart contract on L1 called the StateCommitmentChain. We regularly publish updates of the state trie. With Merkle tree proofs of the commitments, users can use these proofs to make verifiable statements about the data within the storage of any contract on Boba at a specific block height. This can then be used to enable contracts on Boba L2 to send messages to contracts on L1.
The bridge uses the security of the source chain (L1). In an Optimistic Rollup design, state commitments are published to L1 without any direct proof of the validity of these commitments. Instead, these commitments are considered pending for a period of time (called the “challenge window”). In the challenge window the commitment could be invalidated through a fraud proof. Fraud proof challenges are not enabled and there’s a single sequencer design currently in production. In the event of fraud, the malicious actor and the prover of fraud will (in the future) play out an interactive challenge game and the malicious actor will be slashed.
The Boba Network codebase and Optimism’s codebase have undergone multiple audits, with no outstanding vulnerabilities.
More details about Boba Network can be found on our engineering roadmap.

License Exemption
We are requesting an exemption that will allow Boba Network to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Boba Network, a Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.

Timeline
After passing the Temperature Check with 25k UNI voting yes to deploy to Boba Network, we are excited to move forward to the Consensus Check phase to collect further feedback in advance of an on-chain vote.
Following the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Boba Network.

Yes - Deploy Uniswap v3 to Boba
No - Make no Change

Conclusion
Boba Network is primed for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive developer acquisition program for projects building on not just our Ethereum L2, but also on top of Boba L2s for other chains like Avalanche, BNB, and Moonbeam. Our approach will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.

## Financial Incentives for Liquidity

We can consider a launch of Liquidity Farming and [Quadrat Protocol ](https://plasma.finance/quadrat) for Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain, to attract more liquidity and incentives from BNB protocols and users.

## Security and Governance Bridge

0xPlasma Labs would like to propose using [Celer Bridge](https://www.celer.network/) for the Governance cross-chain messaging.

Here is a piece of information about the Celer Bridge provided by @modong 

#### A quick introduction to Celer:

Celer is a generalized blockchain interoperability protocol enabling a one-click user experience accessing tokens, DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, governance, and more across multiple chains. Developers can build inter-chain-native dApps using the Celer Inter-chain Message (IM) SDK 1 to gain access to efficient liquidity utilization, coherent application logic, and shared states. There are 10+ cross-chain applications live today that are built with Celer IM on various use cases including governance and liquidity network protocols. cBridge, a cross-chain asset bridge solution, has processed $12.2b transaction volume across 31 chains for 200K users.

#### How to build Uniswap’s cross-chain governance (with a focus on security models)

Celer IM based cross-chain governance is already live in production with [FutureSwap](https://twitter.com/CelerNetwork/status/1518791556169306113) since the end of April 2022 and has been operating flawlessly since. The reference implementation of cross-chain governance is very straightforward and we describe the high level flow here based on the [application design pattern](https://im-docs.celer.network/developer/celer-im-design-patterns#cross-chain-logic-execution-without-fund-transfer).

When a governance decision is made on Ethereum, the governance contract will call [sendMessage](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-contracts/blob/d879d4cf1a3b69d8cc7c56bb9512a6a493c5be0d/contracts/message/framework/MessageSenderApp.sol#L24) of a “send box” contract which takes in the destination chain ids, message to be passed and destination contract addresses. The message will contain the serialized bytes of the governance decision.

This message will be synced with State Guardian Network, which is a Cosmos SDK based blockchain. Validators in SGN will witness the message and reach consensus on the Cosmos layer that this message indeeded exists and generate a stake-weighted multisignature attestation that is stored on the chain.

A message executor (can be run by Uniswap or run by validators of Celer Network) will collect this message and call [executeMessage](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-contracts/blob/d879d4cf1a3b69d8cc7c56bb9512a6a493c5be0d/contracts/message/framework/MessageReceiverApp.sol#L71) of a “receive box” contract. After necessary on-chain validation of the message, the message will be eventually relayed to the destination contract.

The validation, except for the generic checking of the validity of the signatures, also has two security models available to determine when the target contract will receive the message. The first security model is to directly pass the message on and rely fully on PoS security of the Cosmos chain.

However, in the case of low-frequency applications like cross-chain governance, we recommend using the **second security model**: an optimistic rollup-like security model. In this security model, every message that is passed onto the destination chain will be first put into a “quarantine zone” for a configurable period of time. During that quarantine period, every single validator in the SGN and the application executor (collectively, App Guardians) can monitor and cross-check the message arrived on the destination chain vs sent on the source chain. If there is any mismatch, the message path will be cut off immediately and the message will not be executed. This changes the security assumption from “trust majority stake” to “trust any” with app developers capable of running one of the “any” App Guardians themselves. This is how FutureSwap implemented their cross-chain governance module.

Once the quarantine clock times out, the message will be executed by calling a standard interface on the destination governance contract. This will complete the cross-chain governance process.

Next, we answer the questions raised in the post.

#### Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?

Of course, this is the core of Celer, and all the cross-chain applications are built on top of this functionality. Celer currently supports arbitrary message passing on all EVM-based chains. For non-EVM chains, Celer supports Aptos, Sui, Flow and Cosmos-based blockchains.

#### Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?

This is briefly discussed in the previous walkthrough. Here, we provide a more detailed description.

As discussed above, Celer’s generalized message cross-chain solution comes with two security models and we recommend using the optimistic rollup solution here. More context on Celer’s security models:

Celer comes with two security models that each app and users are free to choose from on a per-tx basis.

1. Cosmos-consensus Security Model

By default, inter-chain dApps rely on the security of the State Guardian Network (a Cosmos Chain) by processing messages routed from another chain without delay. The SGN offers L1-blockchain level security just like Cosmos or Polygon with it being a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built on Tendermint with CELR as the staking asset. If a guardian acts maliciously, its staked CELR will be slashed by the consensus protocol. This level of economic security is something that grows with the staked CELR’s value and is simply not available in simple Multi-signature or MPC/PoA-based solutions.

2. Optimistic-rollup-style delay buffer Security Model ( **what should be used in this case** )

![](upload://8uf1PmN8Xra57O4ORLU5SjzZ2AW)

So, what happens if more than two thirds (in staked value) of the validators behave maliciously in the State Guardian Network? Although this is highly unlikely given the economical security and distributed nature of the validators in Celer Network, Celer does have a second security model, inspired by the Optimistic Rollup design, that works securely even under this worst-case scenario.

Instead of instantly processing a message routed by the SGN, a two-phase commit-confirm pattern is used to process any inter-chain message. Before any application consumes the message, the message has to be “committed” to the blockchain by SGN into a “quarantine zone” for a period of time. Only after the delay has passed, can this message be “confirmed” and pushed to the final destination application.

During this delay buffer, a dApp can run an App Guardian service to double-validate the message on the source chain and check the authenticity of the message committed in the quarantine zone. If the App Guardian detects any inconsistency, it can prevent the message from being processed before the time buffer expires. For application developers who cannot run an App Guardian themselves, they can commission the SGN nodes to undertake the task of an App Guardian. In that case, the security model is strengthened to a trust-any model for the SGN. Therefore, even under the worst-case scenario of the SGN consensus failure, inter-chain dApps built on top of Celer’s construct will still maintain safety property without any concern.

#### Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity?

When operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, the security is dependent on the source chain and on the “trust-any” model as described in the security model section. It does not depend on any single third-party entity or a majority of decentralized parties. As long as one single app guardian is still working in a trustworthy way, the system is secure.

#### Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?

When operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, as long as there is still one app guardian that is trustworthy, it is not possible to have any fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain.

This is very different from other models where when a majority (often 2/3) of validators/MPC signers are compromised, a fraudulent message can be passed to the destination chain.

#### What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?

Their CELR stake will be slashed.

#### Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?

Celer was audited by Certik, Slowmist and Peckshield. No vulnerabilities were identified in any of the audits. We also have a $2M standing bug bounty on Immunefi that is not claimed yet. Celer is the only cross-chain system that has processed more than $1b with no vulnerability exploited or identified.

Dear Uniswap community,

About a week ago we (the Blockchain at Michigan in partnership with the [Celo Foundation](https://celo.org/) and the [Celo Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/)) submitted a proposal to deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo to launch “Green Asset” Liquidity Pools and expand access to Uniswap to the 6B smartphone users around the world.

We initiated the [Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x4fdc5d5c87669d3c99072541e1c775f8dee9b906241b2ce22203737b608c8e55) on Snapshot, where the proposal received strong support from the Uniswap community. 12M UNI (~100%) voted yes for the proposal.

We’re excited to initiate the Consensus Check phase. We’d love to receive your support in this proposal.

NOTE: Based on community feedback we’re also adding the following items to provide more information on a few items:

* Approximately one-third of the $10M of financial incentives to Uniswap users for green asset pools will be placed in a multisig with the Celo Foundation and 2-4 key members of the Uniswap community, including both individuals and institutions. This is to serve as a good faith deposit and demonstrate the Celo Foundation’s commitment to the Uniswap community, while also ensuring financial flexibility for the Celo Foundation. In the past, the Celo Foundation has ensured that promised rewards have been paid out (e.g. Sushi) and the plan is to continue doing so.
* Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Celo by the Celo community through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script).” contingent upon approval by the Uniswap community via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth).
* Governance at deployment will be facilitated by messaging bridge [Optics](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/optics)
* Robert Leifke and Kyle Scott, members of Blockchain at Michigan, are co-founders of Mobius, a Celo stableswap protocol. To avoid any conflicts of interest, they have had no involvement in this partnership between Blockchain at Michigan and the Celo Foundation.

### Updated Proposal discussion Topic:

Deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo to Launch “Green Asset” Liquidity Pools and expand access to Uniswap to the 6B smartphone users around the world

### Description:

In partnership with the Celo Foundation and the [Celo Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/), we propose to authorize the deployment of the Uniswap protocol to Celo on behalf of the community.

Celo is a mobile-first, carbon-negative, EVM-compatible blockchain. Specifically, we propose launching Uniswap on the Celo platform to:

* Increase Uniswap’s influence through $10M in financial incentives to Uniswap users, as well as additional grant funding provided by the Celo Foundation to utilize Uniswap as a financial building block
* Bring Uniswap V3’s increased capital efficiency to the 6B smartphone users around the world
* Create green asset liquidity pools with natural capital backed assets such as tokenized carbon credits (e.g. MCO2 and TCO2) and future nature backed assets issued on Celo like land and forests
* Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the Celo Reserve with nature backed assets rather than relying on centralized exchanges
* Foster pathways for future green use cases on Uniswap

Overall, we believe the Uniswap community’s mission of creating a trustless and decentralized financial infrastructure accessible to anyone aligns with Celo’s vision of tackling climate change and achieving prosperity for all.

### About Celo:

Celo’s mission is to build an open financial system that creates the conditions of prosperity for all. To execute this mission, Celo’s technology features include:

* A mobile-first EVM-compatible layer 1 blockchain that is accessible to anyone with a smartphone
* Carbon negative by allocating 0.1% of epoch rewards to offset carbon—to date, [2,942](https://www.wren.co/profile/celo) tons of carbon has been offset, [which is over 8 times Celo’s carbon footprint](https://medium.com/celoorg/a-carbon-negative-blockchain-its-here-and-it-s-celo-60228de36490)
* Algorithmic Celo stablecoins (currently cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL) with a smart-contract based expansion and contraction platform called Mento
* An overcollateralized basket of crypto assets called the [Celo reserve](https://celoreserve.org/), currently made up of CELO, the network’s native asset, as well as BTC, ETH, DAI, and MCO2

Celo is one of the fastest growing DeFi ecosystems with 2.6[M addresses, up to 1.1M daily transactions, and over 103M transactions](https://thecelo.com/). Additionally, Celo [has been chosen by Kickstarter](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/08/kickstarter-to-start-blockchain-based-crowdfunding-project-report/) for its upcoming decentralized product (to date, Kickstarter has successfully supported over[ 214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats)) which will attract new users to the ecosystem

The Celo Reserve includes almost $1M of MCO2 tokens, and Celo community members have proposed to add more natural capital assets moving forward as part of the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/). By including more natural capital assets, the Celo community has the vision of creating natural capital backed currencies. If, as a society, we were to denominate our economic activity in natural capital backed currencies, any economic growth—increase in money circulation—would lead to a growth in preserved natural resources. Celo aims to be the layer 1 blockchain for natural capital assets, and Uniswap can be the natural capital DEX for these assets on Celo.

### Proposal

Blockchain technology can help address limit greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable practices by tokenizing carbon-sequestering assets such as rainforests. Those tokenized assets can then be purchased by individuals and businesses to democratize carbon offsetting and increase funding for environmental protection projects. We believe that together, Uniswap and Celo can lead the path to growing natural capital assets.

Uniswap on the Celo platform will:

* Allow for the launch of green asset liquidity pools: With the launch of the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/), Celo community members proposed to allocate up to 40% of the reserve over time towards natural capital backed assets. A natural capital backed asset (also known as “green” or “regenerative finance” asset) is a tokenized representation of natural assets in the “real” world. An example of a green asset is a non-fungible carbon-negative initiative quantified in terms of fungible CO2 sequestered (e.g. tokenized carbon credits).
* Advance the use of natural capital backed currencies: The Celo Reserve grows as demand for Celo stable currencies grows. And as the reserve grows, so does the allocation towards green assets. This creates a feedback mechanism: with increased adoption of Celo stable currencies the reserve programmatically generates demand for additional green assets, preserving rainforests, and other carbon-sequestering assets.
* Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the reserve: The Celo reserve will not only need to rebalance its BTC, ETH, etc. holdings but also a variety of natural capital backed assets, such as tokenized land, forests, and carbon credits. If approved by Celo’s community governance, a 40% allocation at current reserve values would correspond to natural capital assets worth 200M USD held by the reserve alone, requiring an efficient and liquid trading counterpart. Currently, the reserve rebalances via centralized exchanges. Green assets are not held by centralized exchanges, and so a decentralized exchange is needed in order to rebalance the Celo reserve as demand for stable currencies increases.
* Increase capital efficiency: Uniswap v3’s concentrated liquidity mechanism will be especially important for Celo’s stablecoins that trade within a small price range.
* Create pathways for future green use cases: Market participants are actively exploring other use cases on Celo. A list of current projects is available on https://climatecollective.org/.

The Celo Foundation will commit $10M of CELO in Uniswap-specific user incentives & grants on Celo. The Celo Foundation has successfully delivered committed rewards in the past (e.g. Sushi) and intends to do so in this instance as well. As a good faith deposit, approximately one-third of the $10M of financial incentives to Uniswap users for green asset pools will be placed in a multisig with the Celo Foundation and 2-4 key members of the Uniswap community, including both individuals and institutions. The $10M of financial incentives to Uniswap users for green asset pools will be placed in a multisig with the Celo Foundation and 2-4 key and active members of the Uniswap community including both individuals and institutions. In addition to the $10M in financial incentives for Uniswap specifically, the Celo Foundation will also focus on broader adoption of natural capital backed currencies and link this to ongoing efforts to making DeFi and crypto more accessible to the 6B smartphone users around the world through the following:

* Promote the development of a mobile-first ecosystem through developer programs such as hackathons with Uniswap as a financial building block

* Lead pilots and users research to help make Uniswap more accessible, especially in markets that lack access to basic financial tools and services.
* Co-grant program to support projects that are launching and driving the growth of “green assets”

Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Celo by cLabs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script).” contingent upon approval by the Uniswap community via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth). Governance at deployment will be facilitated by the messaging bridge [Optics](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/optics).

We propose a transparent measurement of this project's success through the following success criteria and long-term goals:

* % of Celo Reserve allocated to green assets: 40% of the Celo Reserve (at current Celo Reserve levels this would correspond to $200M USD in green assets)
* $ total TVL and TVL of associated green assets: 10x of Celo Reserve green asset holdings in circulation as LP
* Impact of green assets in Celo Reserve: 17M tons of CO2 avoided or removed from the atmosphere (assuming an average price of $12 per ton and current Celo Reserve levels) , including all associated benefits (e.g. increase in biodiversity through protection of forests). This corresponds roughly to the annual absorption capacity of 1.7M hectares of forest area, or roughly the amount of [forest area lost in Brazil in 2020](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2020/).

### Conclusion

Celo and Uniswap together can serve as the foundation for the proliferation of natural capital assets across Web3. We believe that the vision to advance climate and regenerative finance on Celo aligns with the Uniswap community. Thank you for your consideration and we welcome questions and suggestions.

This proposal seeks to onboard Forse by StableLab as a data service provider, helping analyze the effectiveness of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program. The offchain vote (Snapshot) will be a weighted voting where each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices to help to assess three blockchain for Forse to analyze.

Motivation

In February 2024, the Uniswap DAO introduced the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program, which incentivizes users to participate in current and new deployments of Uniswap on different networks within the L2 space. The initial onboarding packages of this program cost the Uniswap DAO at least $3.5M worth of assets.

We propose that Uniswap DAO engage with Forse, our DAO intelligence and analytics platform, to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth program and assess if the current approach drives real growth.

By assessing the impacts of the Revitalization and Growth Program, the Uniswap DAO will have valuable insights to improve further iterations of the Revitalization and Growth Program or other incentive programs. Armed with this information, Uniswap DAO will be able to understand what was the most relevant user groups, and their acquisition cost, and evaluate if the Revitalization and Growth program effectively modified user behavior and led to increased stickiness of users, and therefore TVL and other top-level protocol metrics.

Recently, StableLab supported the Arbitrum DAO as the Program Manager for the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program, and we delivered a comprehensive analysis of the STIP to the Arbitrium DAO.

With Uniswap allocating over $3.5M worth of assets for the purpose of growing Uniswap’s market share, it is essential to ensure that the DAO analyses and reviews the impact of these incentives on an ongoing basis.

What is Forse?

Forse is a data and intelligence platform built by StableLab helping DAOs analyze the impact of governance decisions in protocol growth, top-line metrics, and governance operations, including its cost and effort structures. StableLab is the leading provider of governance products and solutions for decentralized protocols. We work with various projects, from the ones just starting their journey to decentralization to the most prominent DeFi protocols.

This service provider engagement grants the Uniswap DAO access to the services of the entire StableLab team. Specifically, three StableLab team members will be the primary points of contact.

Team

Christian Ziegler is the Tech Lead at StableLab. Previously, he worked as researcher at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he wrote his doctoral thesis on DAOs. In 2018, he co-founded Blockcurators GmbH. Christian has several published scientific articles, including: a Taxonomy of DAOs; scoring methodologies for DAOs; network analysis of DAOS; classification of DAO proposals using LLMs; among others.

Johannes Loewe is the Data Lead at StableLab, where he focuses on all stages of AI and ML development, from experimentation to deployment. Before joining StableLab, he was a Freelance AI & Blockchain Software Engineer. He also has experience with DAOs, being a founding member of PretzelDAO in Munich. He holds a Bachelor’s degree from Radboud University in the Netherlands and a Master’s degree in Machine Learning from NUI-Galway in Ireland.

Marcos Miranda is the Head of Product at StableLab. With over 5 years of experience in Product Management, with focus on Web3 and Analytics products, he is also experienced in building DeFi protocols, having previously worked for other protocols in the space.

Specification

By analyzing the impact of these incentives, Forse by StableLab hopes to identify the following:

Impact quantification of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program in top-line protocol metrics with the isolation of external factors influencing these metrics as far as permitted and reasonably possible.
User segmentation and analysis based on archetypes of users to determine the types of users attracted through the incentive program.
Post-Incentive user retention, reactivation, and user acquisition cost metrics.
Per-dollar value of incentives compared to other ways of incentivising users (e.g. Airdrops, LP rewards, grants, …).
User Retention and activity patterns over the time of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program.
To see Forse in action, explore our interactive dashboard showcasing the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program. This provides a great example of what our output could be for Uniswap’s Revitalization and Growth Program.

Budget Request

The proposal requests $70,000 worth of UNI to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program so far for 3 blockchains chosen by the Uniswap DAO, with 3 months of additional maintenance support and updates to analytics modules utilized in the live dashboard.

Three Blockchains Chosen by the Uniswap DAO

We believe it will be better for Uniswap to better understand the impacts of the Incentive program for protocols that are at least sizable. So the options will compose the top 6 blockchains by TVL.

Since its founding via a timely Uniswap Governance governance proposal in 2021, the [DeFi Education Fund ](https://www.defieducationfund.org/) (DEF) has fought to advance and protect the potential of DeFi in the public policy sphere. The threat that misguided policies and overreaching regulators pose to DeFi has never been clearer. This proposal is to provide DEF with one million UNI tokens in two tranches to support them in fulfilling their mission.

DeFi promises to revolutionize how people engage in economic activities. In particular, the openly accessible and decentralized characteristics of DeFi protocols means that anyone with an internet connection and a wallet can participate in the global economy in a way that would not be possible without DeFi. To do so, DeFi upends the structure of traditional financial services and related policy making approaches. That upending has brought with it intense interest, suspicion, and hostility from entrenched interests and regulatory bodies around the world.

DEF has defended DeFi from legislative threats that would require DeFi developers to implement protocol access restrictions or requirements designed for CeFi businesses; regulatory proposals that would mandate centralization if finalized; and in the courts against overzealous regulators. In late March, we sued the SEC over its policy on airdrops and its campaign of regulation by enforcement that is crippling DeFi and crypto development and participation in the United States.

Over the last few years, DeFi’s policy challenges have become more real, more imminent, and more numerous. For example, in the U.S. alone, there are at least half a dozen bills actively under consideration in Congress and two rulemakings pending finalization that would effectively prohibit DeFi development. Luckily, public policy education and advocacy has borne—and can continue to bear—fruit for DeFi.

Without doubt, building a public policy environment welcoming of DeFi and decentralized governance will be a long and arduous struggle, but we know that Uniswap Governance shares our commitment to winning that debate—and it is winnable—so that the benefits of DeFi can be felt and enjoyed by as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.

DEF is eager to continue leading the fight on behalf of DeFi. With additional resources, we can build out our team:

1. super charge our impact litigation efforts to reshape the legal landscape to DeFi and DAOs’ benefit;
2. expand our outreach to legislators and double down on our educational efforts;
3. more vigorously challenge the regulatory onslaught targeting DeFi; and
4. enhance our ability to engage in state-level debates and jurisdictions outside of the United States.

If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from the myriad policy risks it faces while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing and appreciate your consideration.

**Rationale**

DeFi’s policy challenges are immense and interest in DeFi has only grown since the DEF got to work in 2021. Following the collapse of FTX and with the return of the bull market, there is acute interest in DeFi on Capitol Hill and state legislatures, as well as inside federal and state government agencies. Providing meaningful educational outreach about DAOs and DeFi to lawmakers while also assisting in the legal defense of decentralized organizations is a role not played by anyone else in the US.

At this time, DAOs and DeFi protocols face several potentially catastrophic threats: a live IRS proposal would mandate the creation of intermediaries to conduct tax reporting (i.e., ban on disintermediated systems) and a live SEC rulemaking would define anyone loosely related to a DeFi protocol—including the underlying chain’s miners/validators—to be national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, bills written to regulate CeFi often inadvertently capture DeFi protocols and subject them to compliance obligations designed for CeFi businesses.

If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while laying the foundation for longterm proactive policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. There is a reason TradFi businesses collectively spend over $1 billion per year on U.S. lobbying and policy efforts: it works, and we’re making it work for DeFi.

DEF focuses specifically on fighting for policy outcomes favorable to decentralized finance developers and users on the ground in Washington, DC. A summary of our past work, which has included defending DAOs in court, as well as providing comment and consultation to regulators to avoid burdensome rules and regulations in the US and around the world, below. This proposal would expand our budget so that we can expand our legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy and education efforts on behalf of DeFi and DAO developers and users.

If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from policy risks while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing, and we appreciate your consideration.

**Conclusion**

The DeFi Education Fund is a nonprofit organization with a demonstrated history of being in the trenches fighting for DAOs and decentralized finance. Whether looking to provide legal assistance when DAOs and their members are targeted, providing educational resources, or fighting for policy changes, the DeFi Education Fund is the only major crypto advocate that focuses solely on decentralized web3.

**FAQs**

*Why are you raising money now if you have about two years of runway at your current burn?*

We are seeking Uniswap Governance’s further support now for three primary reasons.

First, we need a good sense of our longer term funding in order to expand our efforts and take on the long term projects that our work often requires, which can play out over several years. For example, our legal challenge of the patent covering oracle tech that is being used against DAOs will likely take a total of at least two years from start to finish. Our lawsuit against the SEC will probably last several years. If we did not have a good expectation of being able to operate two years after starting those efforts, we would not have been able to take them on at all. In addition, because we hold tokens long term, we are exposed to crypto market price fluctuations.

Second, unexpected, ad hoc projects that we are well-positioned to take on in defense of DeFi can be extremely expensive. For example, we expect the challenge to the oracle patent to cost nearly $500,000 over its entire course. A legal challenge to proposed rules that would de facto ban DeFi in the United States would cost well over $1m. We have no ability to predict with certainty when and if those expenditures will be necessary, and without a sense of our longer term funding situation, we can’t take on those types of unexpected, but critical, projects while also expanding our day to day efforts and team.

DeFi needs more dedicated advocates working on its behalf. With a larger budget, we can hire more people.

*When and how would you plan on selling this proposal’s tokens?*

It is important to us that DEF remains aligned with the DeFi community and our supporters over the long term. Upon passage, 500k $UNI tokens would be transferred to DEF’s on-chain Coinbase $UNI [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb39cb7Eb25CE07470Fb59F7548979Fae0Bb85824), and 500k would be locked up in a streaming contract that would “vest” linearly over 12 months. Governance could vote to stop the streaming of the remaining tokens at any time.

We will hold half of any tokens we receive for at least 12 months from the date we receive them, and we will pre-disclose all sales plans in writing.

*How are you going to keep Uniswap Governance up to date on your activities?*

The DEF team will host monthly community calls that Uniswap community members can join to hear updates on our work, learn about high priority policy and regulatory developers, and have questions answered. We’ll also keep a thread on the Uniswap governance forum up to date with our monthly updates.

*What about the tokens from the 2021 proposal?*

We received our initial grant of one million $UNI tokens from the Uniswap Governance in July 2021 and sold half of the tokens shortly thereafter. In February 2024, we began selling portions of the other half of the tokens according to an 18 month written [sales plan](https://www.defieducationfund.org/post/def-provides-update-on-our-funding). We will sell in July 2025 the last of the UNI tokens we received in July 2021.

*Why are you asking us for money and not other DAOs?*

We are, and we will definitely continue to “pass around the hat”! We seek Uni governance’s continued support as a community that is building for the long term. Uniswap Governance took a massive “leap of faith” in generously funding an organization that did not yet exist to do work that would benefit every DeFi project and DAO. We hope that our track record of work has proven valuable to DeFi projects and users such that Uni governance and other projects’ governance will continue to contribute to our work going forward.

Authors: @Doo_StableLab @PGov @AranaDigital

Summary
This proposal outlines the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 2, a compensation program designed to improve participation quality and dedication among Uniswap delegates following the conclusion of Cycle 1.

Background
In late February 2024, StableLab proposed the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative 9. After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702 3

Incorporating these findings, the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative–Cycle 1 was proposed 2 and launched 1 in June 2024.

Success of Cycle 1
The 12 delegates that were selected under Cycle 1 maintained 100% voting participation rate for both offchain and onchain votes during this period. In addition, the Delegate Reward Initiative discussion attracted several new delegates.

New Delegate Name	Delegate Join Date
SEEDGov	May 2024
Curia	June 2024
Tané	June 2024
Bobbay	July 2024
Whetstone	July 2024

Learnings from Cycle 1
While Cycle 1 was simple and effective, there were several suggestions to have a tier system to incorporate different participation levels of delegates. In addition, various suggestions were shared on how to make a points system to determine the top delegate applicants more fair and objective.

Cycle 2 Proposal Details

Application Eligibility

There will be a week-long period for delegate candidates to submit their applications. Top 15 delegates will be determined based on points.
Delegates from Cycle 1 must apply again for Cycle 2–they will not be automatically included.
Delegates that have joined less than 3 months can also apply for the Initiative.

Delegate Reward Eligibility

Once delegates have passed the application process, they must fulfill the following requirements to be eligible for up to $6,000 USD worth of $UNI reward per month.

Requirements

1.Maintain 80% onchain and offchain voting participation for the past 3 months. Achieving this will provide $3,000 USD worth of $UNI
Additional Rewards (the below are only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled)

2a. Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile.

2b. Attend Uniswap Community Calls.

Achieving these above will provide an additional up $3,000 USD worth of $UNI.For 2a and 2b, it allows proportional payment. For example, if there were 4 votings and 1 community call, and a delegate missed to write a rationale of 2 of the votings. The delegate would be eligible to receive $1800 [3/5 * $3000].

Uniswap Delegate Reward Cycle 2 Metrics
In case there are more than 15 eligible applicants, the top 15 will be chosen by the following objective metrics. The highest number of available point would be 10.

1. Voting Participation

-Considering one of the primary roles of the delegate is to receive voting power from their delegators to vote on behalf for the best of Uniswap, voting participation is crucial to ensure quorums are met and malicious proposals are prevented. The total point amount from this category is 6. The onchain part is weighted more heavily due to its usual frictions such as gas cost, as well as its ability to dictate governance contract alterations and movement of treasury funds. The voting rate is based on the past 6 months.

1. Offchain Voting (Snapshot)

80% and above : 2
70% till 80% : 1.5
60% till 70%: 1
50% or below but above 0%: 0.5
0% : 0
2. Onchain Voting

80% and above : 3
70% till 80% : 2.25
60% till 70%: 1.5
50% or below but above 0%: 0.75
0% : 0
3. The date of the first on chain vote is 3 months or more (this is to counterbalance very new applicants who have few votes and able to get full points on the voting)

Yes : 1
No : 0

2. Proposal Authorship

-Helping to write proposals for Uniswap DAO is important. However, we also want to prevent low-quality or malicious proposals. Therefore, only passed votes would count. The total points for this category is 3. The onchain part is weighted more heavily once again.

In case of non-binary proposals, if the choice equivalent to “No” was present, and the end voting result was another choice than “No”, then it would be considered as valid for below. For example, Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) Election wouldn’t be valid for the points as there’s no “No” vote . But [Temp] Uni Onboarding Package - BSC would be valid for the points as there was a choice of “Against”. And the voting result was “$1m”.

1. Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed offchain (snapshot) vote before.

Yes, 2 or more : 1
Yes, 1 : 0.5
No: 0
2.Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed onchain vote before

Yes, 2 or more : 2
Yes, 1 : 1
No: 0

3. Other Governance Participation

-The full point for this category is 1. This category is to recognize other ways one could contribute to discussion regarding Uniswap Governance. This can be achieved by either

1. Joined Uniswap Gov Workshop Before

Yes: 1
No: 0
Or

2. Joined Uniswap Community Call Before

Yes: 1
No: 0
Tie Breaker

-Ties will be decided by the date of the first on chain vote these applicants casted in order to reward those delegates that have been contributing to Uniswap governance for an extended period.

Budget

We are requesting 540,000 [6000 USD *6 Months *15 Delegates ] USD worth of UNI for the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative.

The total amount, once approved, will be sent to the Accountability Committee, which will be responsible for the monthly distribution of rewards to eligible delegates and the proposal authors. Since the total budget of the now disbanded Delegate Reward WG has not been fully used, administration of this reward program–including the creation of this proposal and the admin work behind verifying monthly delegate participation–will be paid for using the current balance of $41.6k. The monthly admin consumption will be communicated each month to the DAO.

Here is the governance forum thread debating this idea: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/moving-defs-assets-to-an-on-chain-custodial-wallet-to-bolster-security/14328

This is the right move for the organization for several reasons:
1. The governance proposal that funded the DEF envisioned the implementation of a security-enhancing product like Tally's Safeguard onto the multisig, but it's not ready for implementation. Safeguard would give UNI governance the ability to (i) stop any multisig transaction from taking place, and (ii) request funds sitting in the multisig to be sent back to the Community Treasury. These features would significantly enhance the security of the multisig against unauthorized/coerced/ etc. transactions.
2. Moving to a custodial wallet likely will present fewer risks to the fund's assets than relying on a four of seven multisig controlled by the committee's publicly-identified committee members, each being effectively 1/4 of a $22M bearer asset.
3. The DEF would only onboard with a custodian that would support an individual wallet for the DEF's assets, meaning it would offer the same level of transparency as a multisig. 

Other details: 
1. Custodian criteria: Security, transparency, and cost. How the custodial wallet would be visible on chain is probably the factor with the most variance across custodians. For example, some use omnibus wallets for multiple clients’ assets, some create a new wallet every time a transaction is completed, etc. A dedicated wallet would be an absolute must in order for the DEF’s funds to be viewable/verifiable on chain, and ideally the wallet wouldn’t change every time there was a transaction in and out of the wallet because that would make viewing/verifying the assets a hassle for the community. When moving assets to the centralized custodian, the DEF would incur a fee based on the dollar value of the assets, which is typically in the range of 25-50 basis points per year. If the DEF moves forward with this proposal, the hope is to work with a custodian sympathetic to the organization's mission who could offer the DEF a ""deal"" on cost. 
2. The DEF would directly on-board with a custodian, and the DEF would continue to pre-announce and explain withdrawals from the custodial wallet on its blog. The DEF would only use a custodian that wouldn’t move any of the assets unless four of the seven committee members validate a transaction to vindicate the four of seven requirement of the current multisig. In other words, only consensus among four of the seven committee members would have the power to validate an outgoing transaction.
3. There has been no security issue to date motivating this proposal.

Enable a 1bp, 1tick fee tier on optimism (L2).

The rationale and initial temperature check for this proposal can be found here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-a-1bp-fee-tier-to-uniswapv3-on-optimism/16930

**Process**:

The complete process is described in Uniswap’s Governance Reference here 4 and can be summarized as:

• A proposal is posted in GovernorBravo on Mainnet (GovernorAlpha for Kovan)

• The proposal is voted, queued and executed via Timelock.

• When all the conditions are meet and is executed, Timelock contract, which is authorized to execute administrative actions on the protected contracts, will execute 
the requested actions in the proposal.

Since this proposal needs to be executed on a different network, in this case L2 Optimism, the executing action needs to be forwarded to the proper target. In order to do that, Timelock will send the transaction to OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger (Optimism mechanism to forward transactions from L1 to L2).

The transaction will then be sent via Optimism contracts to Uniswap’s CrossChainAccount, that is the privileged contract that can execute administrative tasks on protected contracts on L2 Optimism, and CrossChainAccount will forward the transaction, if it has the right origin, to the target Contract, in this case to UniswapV3Factory.
The sequence of contract interactions is the following:

• GovernorBravo.propose(targets, values, signatures, calldatas, description)
    ◦ where targets are the address of the contracts to interact with,
    ◦ calldatas the calldatas to execute on those contracts, and
    ◦ description, the description of the proposal (or name)

• OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(target, calldata, gas)
    ◦ where target is the address of the contracts to interact with on L2,
    ◦ calldata the calldata to execute on that contract, and
    ◦ gas, the gas to be used on that transaction

• CrossChainAccount.forward(target, calldata)
    ◦ where target is the address of the Uniswap contracts to interact with on L2, and
    ◦ calldata the calldata to execute on that contract

• UniswapV3Factory.enableFeeAmount(fee,tickSpacing)
    ◦ where fee is the fee to enable (in hundredths of a bip), and
    ◦ tickSpacing the spacing between ticks

Compiling all the calls together it can be seen as:

GovernorBravo.propose(
[OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger address],
[ 0 ],
[ “” ],
[ encodedCalldata(
OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(
CrossChainAccount address,
encodedCalldata(CrossChainAccount.forward(
UniswapV3Factory address,
encodedCalldata(
UniswapV3Factory.enableFeeAmount(

**Napkin Math**
 
$oneUNI is currently minted with 98% $USDC and 2% $UNI. The goal of this proposal is to loan $UNI to the $oneUNI contract so that the minting ratio may be lowered from 98% to 80%. This means users will begin depositing $0.20 of $UNI and $0.80 of $USDC to mint each $oneUNI.

**Proposal: How much $UNI will be used to mint Stable UNI ($oneUNI) by 11/30/2021?**

If you don’t want Uniswap to loan any $UNI, pick option 1 ‘Make no change’.
If you want Uniswap to support this effort, pick options 2-7. The actual requested loan amount will be the $UNI-weighted average of these selections. Every $UNI counts!
Why isn’t this a single yes vote? Vitalik proposed a ‘skin in the game’ solution to break the ‘tragedy of commons’ problem in token voting.

To date, Uniswap has four deployments: Ethereum, Abritrum, Optimism, and Polygon. In addition to these deployments, there are proposals to deploy Uniswap on Harmony, Celo, and more chains expected soon. The protocol should continue to deploy to new markets, but as the protocol continues to grow, it is vital the protocol learns to manage each of the deployments. With each new chain, there is new infrastructure that needs to be adapted to so that UNI on Ethereum can govern all of these deployments.

GFX Labs has been researching the various deployments and has prepared the first Uniswap cross-chain proposal to demonstrate how mainnet UNI can manage deployments on other chains.

Polygon has a messaging mechanism between Ethereum and Polygon called the [Fx-Portal](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/l1-l2-communication/fx-portal/). The portal functions via three contracts: FxRoot, State Sender, & FxChild. Messages can be sent from Ethereum to Polygon by calling the sendMessageToChild(address, bytes) at the FxRoot contract on Ethereum, which calls the State Sender contract. The [validators](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/validate/polygon-basics/who-is-validator/) monitor the State Sender contract and relay messages to the FxChild on Polygon. Upon successful relay to the FxChild, the message is executed on Polygon by the validators.

The owner of the Uniswap v3 contracts on Polygon is the [Ethereum Proxy contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8a1b966ac46f42275860f905dbc75efbfdc12374#code). The proxy contract will only process transactions that originate from the [Timelock contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc#code) on Ethereum and are delivered by the [FxChild](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8397259c983751daf40400790063935a11afa28a). Every governance proposal targeting a change on Polygon should set the [FxRoot](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe5e5d361b2ad62c541bab87c45a0b9b018389a2#code) on Ethereum as the target and send the message (parameter change) via the contract. The message passed through the FxRoot must contain the target(s) contract on Polygon, the function(s) to call, the call data(s), similar to the proposal system.

For the pilot of cross-chain governance, we are implementing the 1 basis point/1 tick fee tier on Polygon. The 1bp pools on Ethereum have been incredibly successful and increased Uniswap’s market share significantly since GFX Labs’ successful proposal in November 2021.

[Blockchain at Berkeley](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu) is creating this proposal in partnership with [Nomad](https://www.docs.nomad.xyz/) to Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam.

## Summary

In support of furthering the vision of [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.

Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.

Moonbeam is a reputable chain which has enjoyed high stability and considerable activity since its launch in January, making it a great fit for Uniswap’s trusted brand.

## About Moonbeam

Moonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by [Polkadot’s XCM](https://polkadot.network/blog/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format/), allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way.

Moonbeam was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the [100+ projects](https://moonbeam.network/community/projects/) building DApps and protocols on the network.

## Expanding Uniswap to Moonbeam

We believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. 

Uniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s. However, Uniswap has not yet expanded beyond the greater Ethereum ecosystem.

Unlike the other deployment targets, Moonbeam represents a much larger target market — Polkadot users. The growth potential of the Polkadot ecosystem is reflected in part by the fact that Polkadot consistently ranks in the top ecosystems for developer activity, despite having just enabled parachains auctions in December 2021. The Polkadot community has grown in parallel with the Ethereum community, and shares many of the same values — decentralization, censorship resistance, open access to finance, to name a few. However, the two communities have largely been discrete, and deploying Uniswap on Moonbeam brings them together in a meaningful way.

Moonbeam is the de facto DeFi hub for Polkadot. Blue chip DeFi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to Moonbeam, including Sushiswap, Lido, Curve, Chainlink and Covalent. As the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying Uniswap V3 will position it to become a premier AMM on Moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. This represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for LPs and UNI token holders.

The Nomad team has worked on this proposal because [Nomad and Connext](https://medium.com/connext/connext-has-partnered-with-nomad-e20cd8e62e31) have already been deployed as Moonbeam’s main bridging solutions, and have begun to drive cross-chain liquidity from Ethereum into Moonbeam. By deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, Nomad would be able to route even more liquidity into Uniswap pools and additionally facilitate cross-chain communication for Uniswap governance.

## Trust-Minimized Bridging and Cross-Chain Governance

Decentralized cross-chain governance is a topic we are excited about working on within the Uniswap ecosystem. As Uniswap Labs highlighted in their post about [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of Uniswap. The Moonbeam community already uses [Nomad](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) and [Connext](https://www.connext.network/) to bridge ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum; despite Moonbeam having only been live for two months, $35M TVL is currently bridged to Moonbeam via Nomad, with over $250M in total volume since deployment. However, Nomad is more than just a protocol for token bridging; at its core, Nomad is a protocol for trust-minimized arbitrary message passing, and Uniswap V3 deployed on Moonbeam can leverage Nomad for governance.

We have worked with developers at Uniswap Labs to research, understand, and document the current state of [cross-chain governance for Uniswap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQWXCXdA5to7RKfVPozI8vEcw_QJrRQMP9HiQ8nbOu0/edit#heading=h.708hyjg41wlu) deployments. It became clear that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. This problem will multiply as Uniswap is deployed to more chains.

Nomad can provide an out-of-the-box solution for this problem. Nomad’s own contracts are governed by a decentralized cross-chain [governance app](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/blob/main/packages/contracts-core/contracts/governance/GovernanceRouter.sol) built on its arbitrary message passing rails. This application can be [tailored](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/pull/95) for the purpose of governing Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum mainnet. Rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once, however, we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de-risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment, Moonbeam.


## Rewards and Grants

As part of this proposal, Nomad, via a grant from the Moonbeam Foundation, will commit $2,500,000 to the Uniswap Grants Program to help grow the Multichain Uniswap ecosystem.

Through collaborative discussions with members of the Uniswap community, we learned that there were likely higher-leverage ways to enrich the Uniswap community than just providing liquidity mining rewards. As Uniswap develops into a multi-chain ecosystem, we want to support developers working to create high-quality multichain apps building on-top of Uniswap, and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users. These grants will promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation towards this goal.

To borrow language from the [Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/blog/case-study-uniswap-grants/#:~:text=Uniswap%20Grants%20gained%20access%20to,Gitcoin%20was%20founded%20in%202017) announcement, we hope for this initiative to fund “bounties, hackathons, and grants” for “developers, designers, community organizers and other web3 builders” working on multi-chain projects which improve, extend, promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross-chain manner.


Examples of projects that could be funded with this grant include: 
- Building a cross-chain application which allows Uniswap LPs to close a position on Ethereum and open one atomically on Moonbeam
- Improving open-source wallet softwares to create better multi-chain user experiences for Uniswap users
- Building a frontend application which allows governance participants to more easily construct cross-chain governance proposals for Uniswap
- Leveraging Substrate’s native interoperability protocol, XCM, to build an application which composes Uniswap on Moonbeam with another substrate chain
Funding office hours to educate new users about multichain crypto experiences

We are so excited to see what members of the Uniswap community come up with to leverage this grant!

## Conclusion

We are excited about the possibility of the Uniswap community entering the Polkadot ecosystem via a V3 deployment on Moonbeam. To reiterate, we feel that this is a fantastic opportunity for the following reasons:

- **Expansion into Polkadot**: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam’s EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeam’s position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot. 
- **Trust-minimized Governance**: Per Uniswap’s goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomad’s trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future.
- **Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program**: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap. We will commit $2.5M to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the Uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand Uniswap’s multi-chain presence.

We are excited to engage with the Uniswap community and governance process to discuss more around bringing Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam.

### Background: 
Uniswap’s [genesis liquidity incentive program](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) ended on Nov 17. The program distributed 20 million UNI to LPs over 2 months, split evenly between the WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, and DAI/ETH pools. This worked out to 2.5 million UNI per pool, per month.

#### Benefits of UNI distribution to LPs:
Ongoing incentives allows UNI to be distributed to those providing value in the form of liquidity
The incentivized pools are likely to remain the most liquid DEX pair on Ethereum, providing a venue to trade against ETH at virtually any size with zero slippage.
Reduced incentives prevents UNI from being distributed ‘too fast’, marked by all tokens being distributed before the Foundation’s four year vesting has passed.

#### Drawbacks of UNI distribution to LPs:
Ongoing incentives result in UNI largely being ‘farmed and dumped’ to earn yield. See ETH USD Yield Farm, Pickle, Harvest and Alpha.
Reduced incentives means UNI is distributed slower.
Incentivizing the same pools can be seen as choosing ‘winners’ by selecting WBTC as THE Bitcoin on Ethereum and favoring certain stablecoins over others.

### Proposed new distribution: 
Distribute UNI for an additional 2 months from the time this proposal is adopted and executed by governance, but at half the rate of the previous distribution (5 million UNI per month instead of 10 million UNI per month). 

**Note that pool distributions were adjusted slightly from the previous [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-distribute-uni-to-liquidity-providers/8591) process**. Reasoning behind this adjustment can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590/68). 

UNI will be distributed to the following 4 pools:
WBTC/ETH - 1.67 million UNI per month, ⅓ of total
USDC/ETH - 1.25 million UNI per month, ¼ of total
USDT/ETH - 1.25 million UNI per month, ¼ of total
DAI/ETH - 0.83 million UNI per month, ⅙ of total

Please see the liquidity incentive [governance plan document](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590) for full details and timelines. 

### Consensus check question:

Should Uniswap distribute UNI to liquidity providers per the specifications outlined above?

### Next steps:
The previous [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-distribute-uni-to-liquidity-providers/8591) process passed with sufficient support of UNI voters. The following consensus check poll is the second phase of Uniswap’s [governance process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732).

The snapshot poll will be live for 5 days. If the poll passes with a minimum of 50,000 UNI in support, this initiative will move forward as a formal governance proposal.

They propose a new distribution plan with reduced incentives, adjusting the allocation among the same four pools. This new proposal is subject to a consensus check and will move forward as a formal governance proposal if it receives sufficient support from UNI voters.

## Problem

Uniswap's governance treasury will retain 43% of $UNI supply vested over 4 years, currently allocated 113 million in $UNI. Current value ~ ****$2.724 Billion USD. Max drawdown starting on May 3 2021, in 20 days $UNI lost 71% of it's value, a loss of ~ **$3.616 Billion USD.**
We need to manage this systemic risk and volatility for the long term success of the community treasury. 

## Solution

Partial divestment of Uniswap governance treasury by using UMA Synthetic KPI Options to create a win for the treasury, a win for the protocol and a win for the stakeholders. Long term goal would be to put together an actively managed portfolio for the treasury aka uniHOUSE.

# Background

## Yam.Finance

[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has been leading the charge on treasury management for DAOs via our project DAO House: [https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a](https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a)

We've realized that there are significant systemic risks for DAO's treasuries. During the bear market of 2017 multiple projects were forced to sell their treasury at historically low values, which ultimately caused many of them to disband and shutter. 

Treasury management is mission critical for DAOs, yet the challenges and complexities are formidable. Sushi realized this systemic issue and collaborated with [Yam.Finance](http://yam.Finance) to build a custom treasury management solution called sushiHOUSE: [https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106)

The most difficult part of a treasury management solution for a DAO as large as UNI, is the first part, the treasury protocol token divestment. I present a novel solution that will benefit the treasury, the long term success of the protocol and also all stakeholders. 

## UMA Synthetics

A quick primer on UMA: [https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works)

By using UMA's platform, we are able to use battle tested UMA financial contracts to create KPI options. Here are some examples of current KPI options that are already deployed and distributed.

# KPI Options

## How do KPI Options work?

KPI options can be created by using UMA's battle tested UMA financial contracts. 

1. Determine KPI metric for the synthetic. For example, KPI metric is Total Value Locked (TVL), currently ~$1.5b. KPI Metric could be many different things like volume, total fees generated over 30 days ect. 
2. Determine target for KPI, value and expiry date. For example, we want to target 2x TVL start, $3b and want the option to expire end of 2021.
3. Mint KPI option by depositing collateral to be used at settlement. For example, collateralize 1 $UNI token for 1 KPI option. 
4. For our example above:
    1. TVL option starts at a value of .5 $UNI because current TVL is $1.5b
    2. If TVL > $3b before the end of 2021, the TVL option can be settled for 1 $UNI after it expires at the end of 2021. 
    3. If TVL < $3b at expiry it will be worth a fraction of 1 $UNI. For example at expiry TVL is $2b, the value of the synth expires to 2/3 $UNI = .667 $UNI.
    4. Synth is unliquidatable and fully collateralized. 

## How do KPI Options divest UNI's community treasury?

From example above, KPI Option is created by:

1. Collateralizing 1 $UNI token 
2. KPI metric tracked is TVL, starting at $1.5b
3. Target is $3b TVL by the end of the year. If it reaches $3b TVL anytime before expiry  

UNI's community treasury is able to utilize its treasury full of UNI tokens to create these KPI options. 

1. KPI Options would be minted by treasury and sold for stable coins via a gnosis auction or by various other means. Implied value of the option is .5 UNI (current TVL is $1.5b with target of $3b). 
2. The sale would fund the treasury with stablecoins which could then be used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options by using Uniswap's AMM pools. 
3. At expiry all KPI options could be settled and stablecoins withdrawn from LP positions. 
4. Treasury now has stable coins = WIN!
5. UNI stake holders have incentives to increase TVL = WIN!
6. Stablecoins are the cornerstone of long term success for UNI protocol = WIN!

Win - Win - Win

Managing Systemic Risk in Uniswap's Community Treasury using KPI Options",bullish,25.875,2021-05-28 20:43:21+00:00,27.531,27.531,2021-05-29 00:00:00+00:00,6.399999999999991,24.442500000000003,-0.0553623188405796,0.9224668443202972,True," The proposal suggests utilizing KPI Options to divest UNI tokens from the community treasury. Here's a summary of how it works:

1. Collateralize 1 $UNI token to create a KPI Option, with the KPI metric being TVL (Total Value Locked).
2. Set a target for TVL growth, such as $3b by the end of the year.
3. If the TVL reaches the target before expiry, the KPI Option is worth more than the collateralized UNI token. For example, if the target was $3b and the current TVL was $1.5b, the implied value of the option would be .5 UNI.
4. The treasury can sell these options for stablecoins via a Gnosis auction or other means.
5. The treasury now has stablecoins which could then be used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options by using Uniswap's AMM pools.
6. At expiry, all KPI options can be settled and stablecoins withdrawn from LP positions.
7. The treasury now has stable coins = WIN!
8. UNI stakeholders have incentives to increase TVL = WIN!
9. Stablecoins are the cornerstone of long-term success for UNI protocol = WIN!

This strategy allows the treasury to benefit from TVL growth while minimizing risks associated with volatile assets like $UNI. The proposal is based on Yam Finance's experience in building synthetics on UMA's platform and managing DAO treasuries.

This snapshot vote is to determine community sentiment toward a 3 month trial period to compensate active delegate governance participation.

*Current Bootstrap Delegates and self-nominated candidates should abstain in this snapshot vote to avoid any potential conflict of interest.*

## Scope

The forum post on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549) and is a follow-up vote to the previous snapshot vote at [https://snapshot.org/#/0xgov.eth/proposal/0x525061665f30d6e2e4441a1b90e7dda55fc45c289ee7cd7526a5ca9bdb70b628](https://snapshot.org/#/0xgov.eth/proposal/0x525061665f30d6e2e4441a1b90e7dda55fc45c289ee7cd7526a5ca9bdb70b628).

In summary, the goal of the proposed experiment is to reactivate inactive voting power in response to the drop in overall voting participation over the past 18 months which has made it difficult to put treasury funds to productive use.

Beyond reallocating voting power, an additional component to the proposed experiment is compensating active governance participation. Being an active voting member requires time and effort and anecdotally, other communities/projects have seen that compensation is a successful method of attracting participation from representatives with diverse domain knowledge, skillsets, experiences, and points of view.

## Structure of Trial Compensation

The trial will last 3 months and require a budget of ~$15k. This budget will be used to compensate the 5 current active bootstrap delegates (Nikita, Joao, SHA, Gabrigo, Polygon Foundation) and 7 new delegates at a rate of $715/month and $205/month respectively. The difference in compensation rate is to account for the relative difference in voting power (1.5M vs. ~430k). 

While all of the delegates are eligible for compensation, receiving it requires (1) participating in the initial forum discussions, (2) voting, and (3) providing a brief explanation of their vote on a minimum of 85% of the treasury votes that are held each month of the 3 month trial period.

In terms of the mechanics of distributing this compensation, I, Eric Wong, will serve as the administrator. In this role, I will track delegate participation in forum discussion, voting, and explanation in this [publicly viewable spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a3RLui-gfuYZec2Gp-c091IYFOi4z6x_P4fC9_6wv38/edit#gid=0) and serve as the intermediary holder of the funds from the treasury through this wallet `0x84BDa0f95993a03F45c982296496d4F2CC524062`. All funds that remain after this 3 month trial period will be sent back to the treasury.

If this snapshot vote passes, a subsequent treasury vote is still required to transfer the funds. That treasury vote would request a transfer of ZRX from the treasury to the address above. The amount of ZRX would be determined closer to that date due to variation in ZRX’s price.

Delegates must participate in forum discussions, vote, and provide a brief explanation of their votes for at least 85% of monthly treasury votes during the trial period.

This snapshot vote is to gather community sentiment toward reallocating the inactive voting power that was initially delegated during the Bootstrap Delegate initiative evenly across the self-nominated community members.

*Note that this proposal is a variation of the original experiment proposed in the governance forum in two ways that are described below.*

## Scope

The forum post on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549).

In summary, the goal of the proposed experiment is to reactivate inactive voting power in response to the drop in overall voting participation over the past 18 months by empowering new community members.

Over the past week, 7 community members have self-nominated themselves to be considered for the reallocated voting power. Below is an alphabetized list of them linked to their self-nomination:

* [Aishwary](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/4)
* [Celo](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/12)

* [Patrick](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/3)

If this vote is successful, the 3M cumulative voting power that was initially delegated to SonOfPegasus and DeFi Saver will be evenly reallocated across these 7 new community members. 

As noted in the top of this vote description, this proposal differs from the original one presented in the governance forum in both process and outcome.  
* (1) instead of 2 snapshot votes, one to measure sentiment around reallocating inactive voting power and one to indicate support for individuals to receive that reallocation, the variation is 1 snapshot vote to measure sentiment to reallocate inactive voting power to all self-nominated community members;
* (2) instead of reallocating to 3 new members, the variation is to reallocate to all 7 self-nominated members.

**Given that the goal was to increase the number of individuals/groups participating in governance, I believe that these changes are appropriate and do not introduce any significant deviation.**

If this vote passes, there will also be one more snapshot vote to measure community sentiment for delegate compensation which is the second component of the proposed experiment.

Title: [TEMP CHECK] CRVUSD Onboarding on Aave V3 Ethereum Pool
Author: @marczeller - Aave-chan Initiative
Date: 09-10-2023
---

## Summary

This TEMP CHECK proposes the onboarding of the CRVUSD stablecoin, minted by the Curve Protocol, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.

## Motivation

CrvUSD is a USD-peg stablecoin minted by the Curve Protocol. While it's relatively young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $130M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:

- Reinforce synergies between Aave and Curve.
- Offer Aave users an additional decentralized stablecoin option matching the ACI diversity support ethos.
- Strengthen the relationship between the CRVUSD & the GHO stablecoins.

As the primary usecase for stablecoins is to be deposited by users looking for a passive yield and used as a borrowable asset and not as much as a collateral asset, the ACI proposes a CRVUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.

Following CrvUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for crvUSD at a later stage. 

## Specification

Ticker: CRVusd  
Contract address: [0xf939E0A03FB07F59A73314E73794Be0E57ac1b4E](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf939E0A03FB07F59A73314E73794Be0E57ac1b4E)  
Price Feed: [0xEEf0C605546958c1f899b6fB336C20671f9cD49F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEEf0C605546958c1f899b6fB336C20671f9cD49F)

We propose the following parameters for a crvUSD onboarding:

| Parameter                  | Value               |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Isolation Mode             | No                 |
| Borrowable                 | Yes                 |
| Borrowable in isolation    | Yes                 |
| Stable Borrowing           | No                  |
| Collateral Enabled         | No                 |
| Supply Cap (CRVUSD)        | 60,000,000          |
| Borrow Cap (CRVUSD)        | 50,000,000          |
| Debt Ceiling               | N/A               |
| LTV                        | N/A              |
| LT                         | N/A             |
| LB                         | N/A                  |
| LPF                        | 10%                 |
| Base rate                  | 0%                  |
| Slope 1                    | 5%                  |
| Slope 2                    | 80%                 |
| Optimal ratio              | 80%                 |


## Next Steps

1. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.
2. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provided feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
3. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

--------------

This proposal aims to establish a Financial Management Working Group (FMWG) at Aave DAO with the goal of enhancing financial reporting and auditing, GHO stablecoin management, treasury management as well as Safety Module management. The FMWG will be composed of up to five service providers elected through an RFP process outlined below. The approved service providers will each be responsible for one of the key areas/scopes within the FMWG.

[](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193#motivation-2)Motivation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We propose a collaborative-first approach involving multiple service providers to help manage the various core aspects of Aave DAO's financials. With this, we hope to achieve more optimal outcomes by leveraging the strengths and experience of several service providers.

To ensure accountability and progress tracking, a Project Management scope will also be introduced that ties together the various scopes.

Regular reports published on the Forum and dashboards that allow community members to check in on key aspects of the DAO's financial performance round out the picture.

Establishing this working group, sets a precedent for excellence in the DAO space and further underlines Aave's position as an industry leader. It also ensures its long-term survival and makes sure token holders are set up in the best way possible.

[](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193#working-group-scope-3)Working Group Scope
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FMWG will consist of the following scope(s):

-   Project Management and Accountability

-   Financial Reporting and Accounting

-   GHO Stablecoin Management

-   Treasury Management

-   Safety Module Management

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, numerous Aave DAO proposals deal with capital allocation. However, the DAO often lacks a comprehensive understanding of the financial impact and intrinsic value of these propositions.

To address this, the DAO would greatly benefit from a dedicated service provider focused solely on Financial Reporting and Accounting. This would empower governance participants to make decisions based on the best possible data and analysis.

Applicants should cover the following:

-   Provide insights into on-chain financials

-   Develop a DAO-wide budget so the impact and performance of governance output can be tracked

-   Produce regular financial reports, either monthly or quarterly, to ensure transparency

-   Create and maintain up-to-date dashboards reflecting key parameters for the community

-   Analyze the DAO's finances, including grants and operational expenses

-   Provide feedback on the financial impact of major proposals

-   Collaborate closely with other key stakeholders in the DAO

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ensuring GHO gets back to peg and maintains there is Aave DAO's current top priority.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/EucIHnUD-AYsRlPC4yXzC3OsuF5lMZVi_nEgPFeUmdQGmUpHHs0-q2cDGEQ-I-Slhrihp_V6vtDriGCaTHGppEAUHTYAd08xqOOWV22Iiqs4nPUWJBGuTWomAscnBHg7VvtMGG_aXfixpqmfNJxbbZ4)

This scope encompasses initiatives aimed at ensuring both the stability of GHO and its widespread adoption. These efforts include, but are not limited to:

-   Advise on GHO peg management with specific, actionable and timely proposals

-   Advise on GHO adoption and work towards implementation with key stakeholders

-   Assist in the creation and running of a committee to further GHO asset allocation

-   Create monthly reports on progress and measures

Candidates should apply with a tentative plan to stabilize GHO and should ideally have relevant experience in growing demand and supply of stablecoins.

[](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193#treasury-management-6)Treasury Management
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Aave DAO Treasury should be managed with utmost care to ensure long-term sustainability while conservatively maximizing returns.

Applicants should cover the following:

-   Improve the real, measured risk adjusted return of the DAO's treasury portfolio

-   Improve capital efficiency

-   Manage strategic assets

-   Model proposed strategies so that the community can vote with confidence

-   Collaborate with key stakeholders in the DAO

-   Explore and implement protocol owned liquidity strategies

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With recent efforts to enhance the resilience and diversity of the Aave Safety Module, it is important to entrust its management to a specialized service provider with proven experiencein designing and maintaining similar mechanisms.

We invite proposals from service providers who can focus on maintaining and preparing for a shortfall event. Their expertise would enable constant improvements in the safety module's resilience through thoughtful design changes and various parameter iterations.

Applicants should cover the following:

-   Model, analyze, and enhance the stability module performance during shortfall events

-   Develop a dashboard providing the community with a holistic view of these models.

-   Forecast the emission budget

-   Eliminate or diversify circular dependencies to ensure the SM functions optimally in all scenarios

-   Collaborate with key stakeholders to ensure relevant information is disseminated

-   Regularly produce monthly reports to update the community on the progress achieved

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With various service providers working together to cover these scopes, the Project Management and Accountability scope is there to ensure that deliverables are created on time and within budget.

Another important aspect of this scope is to ensure that service providers get what they need from DAO stakeholders.For example, the Financial Reporting and Budgeting scope would be directly affected by proposed changes to Treasury Management.

Applicants should cover the following:

-   FMWG service provider onboarding

-   Interface service providers with DAO stakeholders

-   Track progress of deliverables

-   Ensure progress is visible in the forums

-   Organizing presentations of results

-   Offboard of non-performant service providers

-   Alert the DAO to issues with services provided

-   Facilitate communication between service providers

-   Documentation of scope expertise: The service provider must in clear terms document their expertise in the specific scope. This can be as an organization or on an individual basis.

-   Track Record: The service provider must demonstrate a track record of experience and valuable outcomes within the given scope. This could be best demonstrated with metrics showing valuable outcomes as a result of valuable contributions.

-   Proposed Compensation: Compensation must be clearly defined in each RFP, with all compensation specified to be paid in GHO. Service providers are required to include a breakdown of their cost of services.

-   Every RFP to be considered by Aave Governance must be posted within one week after this proposal passes through the [TEMP-CHECK] stage of Aave Governance.

-   After the deadline, there will be a snapshot vote using the approval voting process. Each scope will have its own poll.

-   Finally, the top three applicants of the snapshot poll for each scope will enter into an on-chain poll to determine the best-suited candidate.

The FMWG will equip Aave DAO with a best-in-class selection of service providers working within their respective fields of specialization to produce a holistic, accurate and up-to-date view into its financials. It will enable governance to gauge the impact of decisions in a more realistic way, and allow better planning and forecasting.

Employing multiple service providers discourages vendor lock-in and allows for individual members of the FMWG to be easily replaced without major disruptions. Aave's Finances contains a wide variety of topics. As such, each domain should be covered by specialized entities that have proven themselves in their respective fields.

[ARFC] Deploy BAL & aBAL from the Collector Contract
Author: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham) and @dydymoon
Created: 2023-02-05 (updated)

---

# Simple Summary

This proposal presents two options for deploying the approximately 100k BAL tokens being acquired by AIP 115 and the aBAL holding in the Ethereum Collector Contract, [1].

# Abstract

AIP 115 has been successfully implemented and Aave has acquired an additional 100k BAL on market. The total BAL and aBAL holding is now 308,978.30. With 200k BAL already committed to veBAL, this proposal will determine how to deploy the remaining 108,978.30 BAL with the overall objective of maximizing the growth potential of Aave, [4,16].

Aave Snapshot voters can choose between two options, each of which has varying degrees of complexity and represents different means of achieving similar goals over different time horizons.

Option 1) Locking veBAL.
Option 2) Staking auraBAL.

Option 1) is about locking B-80BAL-20WETH enabling Aave to participate in Balancer gauge and governance votes, and benefit from the Liquidity Provider (LP) boosting and protocol fees earnings.

Option 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes) and presents a higher yield investment strategy that over time, will lead to more governance influence relative to Option 1).

A Snapshot will be posted enabling the community to choose between both options. Llama recommends voting for Option 1).

# Motivation

This BAL holding has been acquired by the Aave with the goal of supporting Aave lending market adoption. In pursuit of driving growth to the Aave markets, the BAL holding needs to be deployed and utilised.

Aave has the following BAL and aBAL holdings on Ethereum:

* 200k BAL acquired via a token swap with Balancer DAO, [1].
* 100k BAL acquired via an on market acquisition swap contract, [4].
* 8,978.30 aBAL acquired through user borrowing BAL on Aave, [10].

This proposal will focus on how best to deploy the 100k BAL and 8,978.30 aBAL.

## Option 1) Locking veBAL

The Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for 'Balancer Pool Token') for a time duration. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.

In Option 1), Aave DAO converts all BAL (incl. Redeem aBAL for BAL) with sufficient WETH to B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH token is then deposited into the VotingEscrow veBAL contract and locked for the maximum duration, 1 year. This proposal will acquire the B-80BAL-20WETH and explain the goals of utilising the veBAL holdings while a separate proposal will detail how the veBAL is to be managed before being deployed to veBAL.

### What’s veBAL ?

veBAL are not transferable and the voting influence decays on the veTokens balance over time requiring the veBAL to be relocked periodically to maintain maximum voting influence. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be locked from 1 week to 1 year. Ie: 1 B-80BAL-20WETH locked 1 year = 1 veBAL, locked 6 months = 0,5 veBAL etc

* **Gauge-weight Power**
Voting power which influences the BAL emissions on the different gauges. The votes happen every week on Balancer governance. It can be used for several goals which will be described later on this post.

* **Governance Power**
Voting influence in Balancer DAO proposals. Since Balancer DAO utilities off-chain governance, the voting power can be delegated via Snapshot. Note: Llama is currently a Balancer DAO delegate.

* **veBoost**
Locking B-80BAL-20WETH earns a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided on Balancer.

* **Protocol Fees**
75% of all trading fees consolidated for bb-a-USD (stable) + BAL coming from the veBAL gauge are distributed to lockers, [9].

### veBAL Position Overview

By maximising the veBAL holding and using over 308.9K BAL with the proportional amount of WETH (326.88) for a combined worth of $2,719,000 at the time of writing, Aave would receive an estimated ~153,520.38 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. Converted to veBAL, the ~153,520.38 units would represent approximately 1.10% of the BPT liquidity and 1.40% of the veBAL supply. Aave would be one of the largest veBAL holders along with Aave Companies, [5].

With 145,000 BAL tokens currently being minted and distributed each week across four networks and Aave holding 1.40% of veBAL supply, this is equivalent to controlling the distribution of 2036 BAL per week, or $14,496 per week ($753,8080 per year, assuming a BAL price $7.12).

BAL emissions reduce yearly as per the inflation schedule and the next reduction will occur at the end of March 2023, pivoting from 145,000 to 121,930 BAL/week. With 2023 emission and the same veBAL share, Aave would be able to redirect 1,712 BAL/week, or $12,189 per week or $633,850 per year, assuming a BAL price at $7.12.

Aave can utilise its veBAL holdings to support, not limited to, the below strategies:

* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools
* Optimise the yield on treasury strategies
* Bootstrap the Staked aToken Reserves
* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity
* Help sustain the Safety Module yield

The boost amount received depends on the value of the funds deposited and the relative sizing of the veBAL holding. The boost can be used directly on the Collector Contract but considering the amounts of available funds, the boost is unlikely to be sufficient to boost all of Aave’s positions in Balancer Liquidity Pools. Therefore, it is likely any treasury strategies will be a mix of both depositing into Balancer gauges directly or via Aura Finance.

There remains the possibility to sell the veBoost on secondary markets like Warden, [6].

### veBAL yield overview

The veTokens yield can vary a lot depending on several parameters:

* bb-a-USD fees depends on the trading volume (Swap fee: 0.67% APR)
* BAL rewards are coming from the veBAL gauge (BAL rewards: up to 0.91% APR)
* The veBoost yield is hard to estimate as it won’t be the same if used on POL (up to 2.5x the yield), or sold

In the second case, the current minimum price listed on Warden is 0.00014 BAL/veBAL/week

veBoost if sold: from 0.27% APR with a BAL price of 7.14$ and a veBAL price of $18.92

* Bribes: The biggest variation on the veBAL yield comes from the bribes received for the gauge weight power. Last week, the average cost was ~$0.085/veBAL vote/week. Gauges weight APR: 23.3%.

It’s important to note that the yield impact is better when some funds are deployed in strategies, farming boosted rewards on the pools voted.

## Option 2) Staking auraBAL

Option 2) maximises earning whilst forgoing Aave’s ability to participate in BAL emission distribution votes. Both Option 1) and 2) involve obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH position.

After the B-80BAL-20WETH position is obtained, Aave could deposit it into Aura Finance’s auraBAL wrapper contract to earn staking yield in the several forms (1.87% stables (bb-a-USD), 24.09% in BAL and 34.59% in AURA for a total of 60.56% APR), [8].

Depositing into the B-80BAL-20WETH/Aura pool and staking the BPT was considered, however this is more complex to execute and maintain for margin additional yield.

The yield received from the auraBAL holding can be compounded to earn additional yield.

* BAL (24.09% of 60.56%): BAL, aBAL and WETH from the Collector Contract can be swapped for B-80BAL-20WETH and staked on Aura Finance.
* bb-a-USD (1.87% of 60.56%): bb-a-USD can be deposited on Aura to earn 6.53% in (0.06% swap fees, 0.83% bb-a-USD, 2.30% BAL, 3.35% AURA).
* AURA (34.67% of 60.32%): AURA can be locked for vlAURA and used to vote where BAL and AURA incentives will be directed. The vlAURA position generates around 3.34% in auraBAL as well as gives vote weight for proposal and gauge weight voting, [11]. The vlAURA lock period is 16 weeks and 4 days, depending on locking date and after this time, the AURA can be redeemed and swapped.

Growing a vlAURA position over time in addition to the veBAL one will increase the total voting power controlled over time, which will help to drive TVL to Aave markets and generate more earnings.

With 200K BAL from the token swap + WETH to be deposited in veBAL and 108,978.30 BAL + WETH into the auraBAL staking contract, Aave will own ~54,220 auraBAL and ~99,600 veBAL.

By staking 54,220 auraBAL, Aave DAO will hold approximately 1,99% of the auraBAL supply, [7].

Option 2) is focused on depositing B-80BAL-20WETH on Aura to earn more BAL & AURA rewards.

## Comments

To help with the decision making, the table below presents some pros and cons of each approach. The TL;DR: veBAL has an immediate impact whilst auraBAL is a longer term, higher return strategy that compounds over time.

![](https://i.imgur.com/JasIpLf.png)

Llama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating voting power as soon as possible, to support all possibilities mentioned above.

There are several more advanced strategies to which Aave could deploy assets to grow its strategic voting power over time which will be detailed in the RF strategies deployment proposal.

It is reasonable to think that, in time, AURA could be listed as collateral on Aave, generating aAURA revenue which could also be used to bolster this strategy. The compounding effects of using Aave’s revenue stream presents a unique opportunity to gain influence in how BAL and AURA incentives are distributed.

# Implementation

This section has been up dated and uses data from early March 2023 which differs from older data mentioned earlier in this post.

To summarise, the below shows the current BAL and wETH to be swapped to B-80BAL-20WETH.

|Asset|Amount|Price|Value|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|BAL|309,102.07|$6.61|$2,043,756.21|
|wETH|326.31|$1,565.79|$510,939.05|
|B-80BAL-20wETH|||$2,554,695.26|

The amount of B-80BAL-20WETH received is estimated to be 152,617.94 units valued at

Llama proposes the following methodology for obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH holding:

1. Redeem 326.31 awETH for wETH
2. Approve 326.31 wETH on Cowswap
3. Swap all 326.31 WETH to BAL. This routing minimises slippage.
![|307x257](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/91M03SGqVM-CY3EA640gypvHrKToAMDGkze_9_55Ac9ZuOH3fB16bQXc50YjlxsgHbp0auh2pd7aLjNmdjzWevNnyB1zOurqwNRuO88x1VtW4MvifbzV8tVuIo3Ec8icnAPyZ4qj5rtrNUYsMiIfR_Q)
The BAL holdings are now 78,011.66 + 309,102.07 = 387,113.73 BAL
4. Approve BAL on Cowswap
5. Swap all BAL for B-80BAL-20WETH

![|312x312](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NyamWu2oOW0-UTQrXfcgD2kR4Z6J64pqWmD2kFrcZd_8Ay-MrXsGlGtIXnKSbhcHjzvfFFMtGTc_Hlpuel5Qp0j8GevSPNkqB9AkPN5LZhQLmAW-c8jYmESZPCkEI4QkSc8QaOhdFarIytRV6uq2QNA)

Aave is expected to receive 152,617.94 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be deposited into the voter escrow contract and locked to create a veBAL holding for Aave.

At the time of writing there are [14,133,907](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL) units of B-80BAL-20WETH in circulating supply backed by 28,685,996 BAL and 29,196 wETH valued at $235,329,238.4 or $16.65/unit of B-80BAL-20WETH.

152,617.94*16.65 = $2,541,088.70
$2,541,088.70 - $2,554,695.26 = -$13,606.56

In performing the above transactions, Aave incurs $13,606.56 (0.53%) of price impact (slippage) in converting 309,102.07 units of BAL and 326.31 units of wETH.

For comparison purposes, the Balancer veBAL tool generates 153,121.46 units of B-80BAL-20WETH for depositing 309,102 units of BAL and 323 units of wETH. Using this reference data, Aave would incur 0.33% of price impact. This is reflective of the estimated difference in B-80BAL-20WETH received between Cowswap and [Balancer’s veBAL Tool](https://balancer.tools/veBAL).

The number above are accurate at the time the post was drafted and shared for review. The final numbers to be used will be based upon the actual BAL and aBAL holding at the time.



# Future Considerations

The above proposal focuses on whether Aave’s preference is for maximum governance influence or yield. Depending upon which direction Aave elects to proceed, there will be various other considerations and discussions that emerge.

Those considerations are:

* Determine how to use the veBAL and/or vlAURA holdings, GHO, staked aToken pools, pools include in the Safety Module upgrade
* Implementation of meta-governance, via Snapshot, AIP, multi-sig etc…, [3,4]
* Continual conversion of aBAL and awETH to veBAL, if Option 1) is voted

250,428,873,873,873,2022-05-09 20:52:31+00:00,aave,"## Summary

A proposal to whitelist Connext, a trust minimized cross chain protocol, for V3 Portals on 6 chains: Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony - with credit lines for USDC ($2m on each chain), USDT ($1m on each chain) and ETH (40 ETH on each chain).

## Reasonale

[Connext](https://connext.network) is a network for **fast, trustless communication between chains and rollups**. It is the only interoperability system of its type that does this cheaply and quickly without introducing any new trust assumptions. Connext is aimed at developers who are looking to build bridges and other natively **cross-chain applications**.
To date, over $1.3b in transactions have crossed the network.

Our network of liquidity providers only works with native assets, or the most canonical representation of a wrapped asset.

With our [Amarok upgrade](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4), a series of improvements are coming for users, developers and liquidity providers (routers): the latest will be tasked with providing capital upfront to the users, while getting refunded within 30 minutes when the slower confirmation, coming from the [Optimistic communication protocol Nomad](https://blog.connext.network/optimistic-bridges-fb800dc7b0e0), is completed.

Users’ transactions get confirmed in seconds, LPs get rewarded with a fee on the transaction for their service.

**Portals are therefore a perfect match for Connext as our LPs will need and want to access immediate extra liquidity to fulfill transactions, and our new architecture allows for this operation to be completed via the protocol in a trust minimized way**.

## Technical Specifications

Connext is much more than a bridge, it’s an **interoperability protocol**: it allows to build cross chain applications without adding trust assumptions.
One of these applications are bridges, others could be cross chain NFTs marketplaces or cross chain governance portals.

**51 routers are currently providing $40m+ of liquidity.**
The highly capital efficient architecture of Connext allows for higher volume (and therefore higher returns) with less capital compared to other solutions in the space.
The system is currently working on a whitelist basis. Once the [NEXT token](https://blog.connext.network/whats-next-d3044de49397) is live, the whole network will be permissionless.

## How does it work?

This is an overview of the Amarok architecture that is currently on testnet and planned to go live in a few weeks:

![image](ipfs://QmZVvSsU5ra6vFvMiu82iMAieP1LFuS44EjsbLJVkeUj8N)

The new flow heavily utilizes Nomad (and eventually other localized messaging layers) for its security model. Routers front capital and execute calls for a user’s transaction, and claim against funds going through Nomad.


A full overview can be found [here](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4).

This model fits with the Aave Portals. This is how the simplified architecture integrating Portals will look like - credits to Delphi Digital for the image.

([Development progress deep dive](https://github.com/connext/nxtp/pull/1074)).

The logic for the execute and reconcile methods for the Aave portals has been completed and is ready for audit.

#### Is there a fee model for participants?
LPs currently take a 5bps fee from every transaction

Analytics dashboard of Connext: https://connextscan.io

Bridge for users: https://bridge.connext.network

Technical documentation: https://docs.connext.network

## Proposed list Credit Line request

The credit lines are requested for the following networks where both Connext and Aave are already present.

Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony

![aave.png](ipfs://QmbxAKskwg6caRq4j9ogFUA5xUqmHSLmT8WU8mwXbJdg56)

Note: Routers providers are charging 5 bps to complete cross chain transactions.
All outstanding loans are repaid within 60 min (avg 30 min), effectively paying a high interest rate: 0.005% / 60 min → 44% APR

#### Incentives
A Liquidity Mining program might be approved by the DAO once the NEXT token goes live.

## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
## Date: 2024-07-25
---
### Simple Summary
We propose updating Merit parameters and rewarded actions to increase program efficiency for Round 7.

### Motivation
The Aave protocol has maintained and developed its market share in DeFi in a highly competitive landscape thanks to the Merit program. Recent rounds of Merit have been successful, and we aim to build upon this success while adapting to new strategies and market conditions.

Merit aims to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program. Therefore, it needs to be updated and adapted when new strategies can be applied.

### Specification

**Boosters Update**

1. Retain and Expand:
   Expansion of Second Degree Aligned Users Booster: This booster will reward users of Defisaver and **now also Gnosis Safe**, recognizing their importance in the broader DeFi ecosystem and encouraging their integration with Aave.

2. Remove:
   - ""Diversity supporter"" LST boost. This will be replaced by a dedicated boost for the Etherfi Aave market, allowing for more targeted incentives.
   - **GHO minting rewards in favor of StkGHO**. With the recent policy to tap the GHO borrow rate to match the MakerDAO DSR, the cost of minting GHO was decreased significantly, leading to a ""Net"" borrow rate below markets, especially for users also benefiting from the StkAAVE discount. This has made the maintenance of the peg of GHO more difficult as the carry trade opportunity has been seen as attractive for some users. We consider it more efficient to focus Merit on StkGHO for Round 7.


3. New Addition:
   - **Etherfi Aave Market Boost**: A new, dedicated boost will be created to support and incentivize participation in the Etherfi Aave market, recognizing its unique position in the ecosystem This expansion is contingent on Governance approval of its deployment

### Next Steps
1 escalate this [ARFC-Addendum] proposal to a Snapshot vote for formal approval.
2. If [ARFC Addendum] is approved in the Snapshot phase, apply changes to Merit Round 7.

### **Author: ACI**

### **Date: 2024-08-12**

---

# **Summary**

This proposal suggests increasing the informal supply cap restriction previously set by the community in the past vote [[Temp Check] - Community Preference for Supply Cap Limits for LSTs](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba).

## Motivation

LST collateral and correlated asset borrowing with E-Mode is one of the primary use cases of Aave across networks. Previous discussions around supply cap methodologies resulted in the [TEMP CHECK] vote to limit the maximum supply cap of an LST to 75% of that LST’s circulating supply. 

In the year and a half since that vote, Aave has continued to grow and new liquid restaking tokens (LRT) like weETH have shown strong demand as collateral in the protocol. LRTs have also seen strong proliferation to various chains with varying levels of the total supply spread across multiple L2s. 

As a result, Aave is often the main location for storing LST and LRTs on any given chain and often represents an outsized share of the total supply on any given chain. 

In this new environment, Aave has becomes the main location for LRT supply on chains like Scroll and Base, while also driving LST/LRT demand on chains like Polygon PoS. Simply put, when Aave increases LST supply caps, new supply comes to fill it.

LST and LRT have also had longer time in the market, with clear support for peg and asset profiles developing. Aave’s use of oracles based on the LST redemption rate and implementation of CAPO have allowed for reduced risk from the secondary market volatility. 

This calls for a new limit on a collateral’s supply limit as a percentage of the total supply. This proposal suggests raising the community preference supply cap limit to 90% of the total supply. 

## Specification

- The community preference will update from 75% of total supply to 90% of total supply.
- Risk Parameters will be updated by Risk Service Providers based on the results of this ARFC as needed.

A proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) for CRV on Aave V3 Polygon.

## Motivation

As the market liquidity of CRV has seen a substantial decline following the initial Polygon V3 listing, this proposal seeks to address this by decreasing the liquidation threshold (LT) and loan-to-value ratio (LTV). The objective is to mitigate the risk exposure associated with CRV and diminish its borrowing power, thereby aligning it more accurately with the existing market climate. 

As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. We suggest reaching the desired settings with a series of incremental decreases to minimize this impact. This proposal recommends a slightly more aggressive reduction than the one discussed in the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, reducing the LT by 5%.

Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.

At the time of writing this post, zero (0) accounts will be affected by the proposed decrease.

## Specification

| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CRV | LT | 80 | 75 |
| CRV | LTV | 75 | 70 |

## Next Steps

1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.
2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.

## Title : [ARFC] wGHO Aave V3 Onboarding

## Author : Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs

## Date: 2023-09-15
---
## Summary

This proposal aims to onboard wGHO, an ERC-20 token wrapper of GHO, as a collateral-only asset in a newly created stablecoin emode within the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.

## Motivation

The onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.

This integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.

Alongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.

It's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.

wGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. 

## Specification

The ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:

- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset & isolation mode asset.
- wGHO parameters:

| LTV | 77% |
| --- | --- |
| LT | 80%  |
| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |
| Supply Cap | 1M |
| Borrow Cap | 0 |
| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |

### Note:

wGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.

Onboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.

## Disclaimer

The Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The he author have both large GHO debt & GHO holdings. The ACI uses GHO to fund the [Orbit program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241).

## Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback and consensus on this ARFC.
2. Escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot Stage.
3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE approved, escalate to AIP stage.

## Summary
This publication presents the community an opportunity to add gmBTC on the Arbitrum Aave v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Motivation
GMX Protocol is the largest DEX offering derivatives and one of the most popular DeFi’s today. The introduction of several new features and integration with Chainlink Data Stream in GMX V2 has significantly reduced the risks of front-running and price manipulation compared to GMX V1. gmBTC is a BTC-USD's Liquidity Token on the GMX V2 and earn fees from leverage trading, borrowing fees and swaps. 

Integrating gmBTC as collateral asset in the Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool has the potential to create new demand for borrowable assets on Aave V3.

## Specification

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V3 Ethereum. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-aave-v3-eth-pool-weth-parameters/15110).


## Motivation

The current yields of stETH and reth have been observed at 3.3% and 3.07% respectively. By adjusting the slope1 parameter of WETH, we aim to:

- Enhance Profitability in Leverage Loops: The proposed adjustment will make leverage loops more profitable for users.
- Align with stETH and reth Yields: The adjustment aims to set the slope1 slightly below the current yields of stETH and reth, ensuring Aave remains competitive.

Increased utilization of ETH reserve is expected to partly compensate for the slight loss of protocol revenue due to lower interest rate equilibrium.





## Specification

We propose two options for the weth slope1 parameters:

- **Option 1 (Conservative)**: Set slope1 to 3.2%. 10 bps below stETH yield but above rETH yield
- **Option 2 (Aggressive)**: Set slope1 to 2.8%. 50 below stETH yield & 23bps below rETH yield allowing both to be profitable.

Additionally, we propose reducing the optimalRatio to 80% to mitigate liquidity risks.

author: @MarcZeller @MatthewGraham @Llamaxyz 
created: 20-08-2022

## Simple Summary

In response to Tribe DAO’s proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by FEI borrowers to the Reserve Factor.

## Abstract

Tribe DAO is dissolving the DAO’s assets and TRIBE governance token. As a result, FEI will become backed 1:1 with DAI and redeemable 1FEI:1DAI. With Tribe DAO transitioning into a terminal state, the FEI stablecoin will overtime be redeemed for DAI.

As FEI is redeemed for DAI, over time FEI’s circulating supply and liquidity will also fall away. Without sufficient liquidity, liquidations can not be performed efficiently which creates a risk for the Ethereum Aave v2 market.

In response to recent events, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. A separate forum post will emerge that recommends all aFEI be redeemed for FEI and swapped for DAI via the contracts deployed by Tribe DAO.

This proposal is to disable lending and borrowing of FEI whilst enabling existing debt to be repaid and collateral to be withdrawn.

## Motivation

With the emergence of news that Tribe DAO intends to dissolve FEI and the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) backing the stablecoin, there is a need to amend the FEI lending market in preparation of the risks to emerge with transition Tribe DAO to a terminal state.

The details around how Tribe DAO will transition from current state to terminal state can be found [here](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475).

As FEI will be redeemed for DAI, the stablecoin will suffer diminishing liquidity and diminishing supply. This renders the FEI stablecoin not suitable as a supported asset on Aave markets.

## Specification

The recommendation is to disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor.

**Risk Parameters:**

Freeze the FEI market which will:

Borrowing Enabled → Disable 
Lending Enabled → Disable 

Also,

Reserve Factor 20% → 100%

## Next Steps

The next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the **earliest 24th August 2022**, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to modify FEI risk parameters as outlined above at the earliest possible date **29th August 2022**.

Title: [ARFC] Receipt of Gauntlet Insolvency Fund
Author: @llamaxyz
Dated: 2022-11-06

---


# Simple Summary

Llama proposes that Gauntlet's Insolvency Fund be transferred to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve in the form of AAVE tokens.

# Abstract

In response to excessive CRV debt, Gauntlet is to transfer the funds held in the Insolvency Fund to Aave. Llama proposes that the Insolvency Fund be transferred in the form of AAVE tokens to the Ecosystem Reserve. 

stkAAVE is to be unstaked and the resulting AAVE transferred to the following address: `ethereum: 0x25F2226B597E8F9514B3F68F00f494cF4f286491` 

# Motivation

Gauntlet has already committed to transferring the Insolvency Funds to Aave as mentioned on this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-repay-excess-debt-in-crv-market-for-aave-v2-eth/10779). This proposal is to formalize that Aave is to receive AAVE tokens and that they are to be received into the Ecosystem Reserve.

Llama proposes that the AAVE tokens from the Insolvency Fund are not used to purchase the CRV needed to repay the excessive debt in the CRV Reserve. Acquiring the required CRV is to be funded in an alternative manner. A separate proposal will emerge providing a place for conversation around how to proceed with repaying the bad debt within the CRV Reserve.

# Specification

Gauntlet is to perform the following:

* Unstakes the stkAAVE holding
* Upon the cooldown period ending, retrieves the AAVE
* Transfers AAVE to the Ecosystem Reserve

Ecosystem Reserve: `ethereum: 0x25F2226B597E8F9514B3F68F00f494cF4f286491` 

# Next Steps

* Snapshot is to be posted on the 11th December

title: [TEMP CHECK] Safety Module - Create GHO/USDC E-CLP Category
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
created: 2024-05-13

---

# Summary

This publication proposes creating a new Safety Module (SM) category for the GHO/USDC E-CLP by Gyroscope built on Balancer v2.

# Motivation

Similarly to Staked ABPT, the ability to stake GHO liquidity pool tokens improves the value proposition of the SM by providing the dual service of deep GHO liquidity and protection in the case of protocol shortfall events. Additionally, Liquidity Providers (LPs) can also benefit from earning trading fees.

The Gyroscope protocol developed a concentrated liquidity AMM called Elliptic Liquidity Pools (E-CLPs) that sits on top of Balancer. This technology achieves liquidity efficiency by providing assymetric liquidity to a specific price range based on parameters like amplification, price boundaries and peak location. More information about E-CLPs can be found [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps).

With GHO trading close to $1.00 and the [GHO Stability Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-fund-usdc-usdt-gsm/17566) to be funded, now is an ideal time to add a GHO LP to the SM. By adding the GHO-USDC E-CLP, it is expected to significantly improve market depth as well as USDC liquidity with the SM. Unlike other pool types on Balancer, the E-CLP requires dual asset deposits upon entering the LP.

The Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) developed expertise on the E-CLP technology designing and incentivising one [pool](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0x3932b187f440ce7703653b3908edc5bb7676c283/) optimized for volume when closer to peg and another [pool](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0x99e7b15df044e1b62e2e1774fd4469d54d9409ac/) optimized for price volatility.

# Specification

After studying various configuration of Gyroscope's E-CLPs, karpatkey_TokenLogic recommends adding the following E-CLP to Aave's SM.

![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5336955108681965996-y|1280x592](upload://lf2kNSuj4SOig7aU2KZOvOFfvro.jpeg)

![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5336955108681965997-y|1280x618](upload://qtM2oYr8FuDoWtjjeflW4MkgLBV.jpeg)

Create a new GHO/USDC E-CLP SM Category with the following characteristics:

| Description     | Value  |
| ---             | :---:  |
| Lower Bound     | $0.996 |
| Upper Bound     | $1.001 |
| Peak            | 0.9995 |
| Amplification   | 1,250  |

The following initial E-CLP SM parameter configuration is proposed optimizing emissions for a target liquidity of $5M at 20% APR:

| Description            | Value              |
| ---                    | :---:              |
| Emissions Nomination   | GHO                |
| Daily Emission         | 2,750              |
| Slashing Rate          | 50%                |
| Cooldown Period        | 20 days            |

This proposal also recommends that GHO/USDC E-LCP is included in FastPass with the following initial parameters:

| Description            | Value              |
| ---                    | :---:              |
| FastPass Fee           | 100 bps            |
| Fee Destination        | Collector Contract |
| Daily Withdrawal Limit | 500k               |

In addition to the above, we also recommend implementing the strategy detailed in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-gho-usdc-usdt-bpt-to-safety-module/15195) which enables the DAO via the vlAURA hodling to vote BAL and AURA rewards to this SM Category. This option then enables the Aave DAO to use is strategic assets to partially sustain the SM category.

**Title:** [ARFC] Stablecoin Harmonization and Asset Parameters Optimization 
**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-01-03

---
## Simple Summary

This ARFC proposes focusing stablecoin collateral usage on USDT and USDC while setting LTV to zero for less-trafficked stablecoins and long-tail assets. The objective is to minimize risk for the protocol, optimize revenue generation, and align with market demand trends.

## Motivation

Aave's revenue primarily comes from wETH borrowing and stablecoins borrowing. Years of User behavior data in DeFi indicates a low demand for fluctuating assets as collateral except in use-case-specific scenarios (LST/LRT loops for Weth, RPL borrow to deploy mini pools). Based on @ChaosLabs  [data](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Ethereum/listed-assets/), only 2.4%, 3.7%, and 5.8% of supplied DAI, USDT, and USDC on Ethereum are being utilized as collateral. We can also note that market demand for alternative stablecoins is less sensitive to borrow rates compared to blue-chip stablecoins like USDT and USDC.


The DAO governance has been lenient in onboarding some collaterals, such as KNC, which currently attracts nearly zero traction (currently used to generate 0.79$ of borrow volume) and generates minimal revenue. Additionally, the asymmetric risk presented by stablecoins, such as during the CRV event (collateral was USDC with very high LT and low LB), highlights the need for optimization considering Risk/reward.

## Specification

### Proposed Adjustments:

The ACI proposes the following strategy shift:

1. Focus on USDT and USDC as primary stablecoin collaterals.
2. Set LTV to zero for alternative stablecoins and long tail assets.
3. Enable a 3%/week LT reduction for these stablecoins assets, providing ample time for users to react and keep them as passive yield sources or borrowable assets that represent 99% of current user demand and most of protocol revenue.
4. Propose the following adjusted standardized ReserveFactor categories for Aave assets:

| Collateral Type | Reserve Factor % |
| --- | --- |
| wETH | 15% |
| USDC/USDT | 10% |
| Alternative stablecoins & long tail assets | 20% |
| DAI | 25% |

5. Fade out as collateral the following stablecoins: 

- FRAX
- LUSD
- EURS
- agEUR
- JEUR
- MAI

6. freeze (if not already), then slowly offboard the following alternative stablecoins and long-tail assets that failed to gain traction by gradually increasing RF to 99.9%, decreasing LT by 3% per week then applying incremental interestRateStrategies incentivizing users to switch to others collaterals or borrowed asset as the DAO implemented for BUSD and TUSD on Aave V2:

| Collateral Type          | Network      |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| EURS                    | All pools     |
| agEUR                   | All pools     |
| JEUR                    | All pools     |
| MAI                      | All pools    |
| KNC                     | Ethereum     |
| STG                     | Ethereum     |
| BAL                     | All pools    |
| FXS                     | Ethereum     |
| UNI                     | Ethereum     |
| WBTC.e                  | Avalanche      |


## Next Steps

1. Community feedback and gather consensus on the proposed adjustments.
2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.
3. If successful, escalate to AIP stage.

Title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - GHO Liquidity Strategy Update
Author: @TokenLogic
Dated: 2023-09-08

---

# Summary

This publication details the revised liquidity strategy for GHO across Ethereum DeFi.

# Motivation

This publication outlines the GHO liquidity strategy with two main objectives:

* Improve GHO peg
* Promote diversified liquidity across multiple exchanges

It is widely accepted that the GHO peg requires improvement. This was especially evident when GHO traded at beneath 96 cents.

Furthermore, several liquidity pools have come about organically on Maverick, Uniswap and Curve. Similar to the Balancer pools, these pools are mostly GHO which is reflective of the GHO price relative to the stable coin being paired within each pool.

Do note, the existing Balancer pools are not being supported by Aave DAO. These pools are being supported by veBAL and vlAURA holders, mostly from contributors within each community.

The two initial pools being considered are GHO/USDT/USDC and GHO/LUSD until SM integration. This will be presented in a separate forum publication for future discussion. This publication will outline the Primary and Secondary Pools being proposed for GHO:

* Balancer GHO/USDC/USDT - Primary
* Balancer GHO/LUSD - Primary
* Maverick GHO/LUSD Static - Secondary
* Maverick GHO/LUSD Both - Secondary
* Uniswap (Bunni) GHO/USDC Wide - Secondary
* Uniswap (Bunni) GHO/USDC Narrow - Secondary
* Curve Finance GHO/crvUSD - Secondary

For the purpose of this publication, we shall focus on the non Curve Finance pool. The GHO/crvUSD, and potentially GHO/FRAXBP, will be supported initially by the Aave DAO strategic asset holding once ready. How the DAO is to deploy the recently acquired CRV, is still yet to be determined.

This proposal aims to create a structure of liquidity outside of the SM strategy, including efficient options such as concentrated ranges of liquidity incentivised with and create a 3 months trial budget for vote incentives/rewards.

## Maverick

Maverick is an AMM capable of automating liquidity strategies without requiring maintenance. It enables to maximise capital efficiency by automating the concentration of liquidity as price moves. This built-in feature also helps LPs to eliminate the high gas fees that come from adjusting positions around price themselves.

MAV is the governance token, however the tokenomics aren’t fully revealed yet. It’s known that MAV has a veTokenomics model. MAV emissions didn’t start yet, but it’s possible to incentivize liquidity on Maverick by adding rewards by creating & incentivising a boosted pool for a defined amount of time between 3 to 30 days.

[A GHO/LUSD pool with 3 BPS & 0,1% width](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions/0x30856df27a23d72b67347165f85e04b15d716d9e?chain=1), with liquidity in the range from 0,9811 to 0,9980 GHO per LUSD has been created and incentivised by Liquity with 1,5k LQTY per 7 days during 3 weeks. Additionally, LUSD liquidity managers proposed to create co-incentives for GHO/LUSD pools by committing up to 5K LQTY/month for the trial duration if this proposal is approved.

Considering that a range can’t be updated by governance, and since the pool was full GHO a few days ago, we’re considering updating the strategy above by creating a wider mode static boosted pool, and creating a pool mode both on top.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H15VjV8ya.png)
    
As that the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch & since the unspent budget can’t be clawback (liquidity mining), incentives will start with a lower amount for a small duration (7 days) to easily follow the liquidity growth with the budget. Additional incentives can be added at any time.

Pros of incentivising liquidity on Maverick
* Automated rebalancing
* Fully customisable strategy
* Maximal liquidity efficiency
* Co-incentives if paired with LUSD
* Protocol Owned Liquidity can reduce costs

Cons of incentivizing liquidity on Maverick
* MAV emissions are not live yet
* Updating a range requires to create a new position
* Pools contracts are not verified yet
* Boosted pools incentives are limited to 30 days (can be renewed)

## Uniswap v3, Bunni.pro & Liquis

Uniswap V3 allows concentrated liquidity: liquidity allocated within a custom price range. It highly increases liquidity efficiency, leading to more volume, and with the potential of supporting stablecoins peg.

Bunni is a liquidity engine for incentivizing Uniswap v3 liquidity composed of two parts:

* Protocol that wraps Uniswap liquidity positions into fungible ERC-20 tokens
* vetokenomics system for incentivizing Bunni liquidity

It enables the creation of gauges receiving emissions while liquidity is in range. However, the liquidity isn’t actively rebalanced and gauges can be killed if the liquidity is out of range.

Liquis is a governance wrapper for Bunni.pro similar to Convex & Aura.

A [GHO/USDC pool with 0,05% fees](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x5c95d4b1c3321cf898d25949f41d50be2db5bc1d), with the range from 0,9497 to 1,0247 GHO per USDC has been created by community members. Timeless core contributors created an initial smaller range from 0,9757 to 1,0253 GHO per USDC, and submitted the proposal [TRC-66](https://gov.timelessfi.com/discussion/12245-trc-66-enable-ghousdc-gauge-with-2-cap) to enable GHO/USDC Gauge with 2% Cap on Bunni, which was [approved on July 27th](https://snapshot.org/#/timelessfi.eth/proposal/0xdf4027ad5c071bcbf045b9cb096ee63cae8bccacf4f33e489e50942c906419ee).

Ranges can be updated by governance, and since GHO went below the current price over the past days, we’re considering updating the wide range above, and creating a new narrow one on top.

The Aave DAO does not hold veLIT & oLIT incentives total worth is limited, so to reach the TVL target, this strategy will initially be supported with both veLIT/vlLIQ votes incentives created on Warden Quest, and GHO liquidity mining deposited on Bunni.pro gauges.
 
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H14_jELJ6.png)
    
Bunni gauges are not live yet, so the Min/Max APR on oLIT emissions will update depending on the actual working supply of each pool. For these estimations, the working supply used is from the current GHO-USDC proportionally to the estimated TVL.

Liquis just launched and will enable a better optimisation but the LIQ token has no price yet, and the first round vote ended on September 6th so it’s not yet included in the tables below but this strategy will most likely be improved in the coming weeks.

Nevertheless, they have a launch partner program ongoing giving access to LIQ tokens vested in exchange of a bribe amount committed over 6 months max, but closing this week as the protocol launched.

The conditions are 0,1% of LIQ supply vested over 4 years for 10,000$ worth of votes incentives for vlLIQ holders (controlling veLIT voting power). While the tokens are vested, the voting power can still be used until the end of the vesting duration, further increasing the yield or enabling recycling part of the bribes spent. More information on the program can be found [here](https://mirror.xyz/liquis.eth/K_-1jp7sLkylKc2V1XxkK0CObsqyaTq-89yScI4tapo).

veLIT bribes were initially considered, so if this proposal is approved, the Aave DAO will be a launch partner by committing an amount of $20k of votes incentives for vlLIQ holders over the next 3 months and will receive 0,2% of the LIQ supply.
 
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1m5oN8yp.png)
    
These estimations are made at the current time so it excludes LIQ emissions, liqLIT redemption mechanism, DAO vested voting power & impact on the strategy. The tables will be updated in the coming weeks if the overall strategy is approved. The proportion of bribes veLIT vs vs LIQ vs LM might also be optimized during the trial.

Similar to Maverick, as the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch & because the unspent budget can only be clawback, which represents a limited part of the budget, LM rewards will be added progressively every 7 days to follow the TVL growth.

Pros of incentivizing liquidity on Bunni/Liquis
* Built on top of Uniswap v3
* LIT tokenomics are live (oLIT & veBoost)
* Liquis (Convex-like) recently launched will enable strategy optimisation
* Launch partner program earning LIQ tokens vested & voting power
* Updating a range earning rewards can be done by governance
* Extra liquidity mining rewards can be added on Bunni gauges
* Protocol Owned liquidity can reduce costs

Cons of incentivizing liquidity on Bunni/Liquis
* Liquidity is not automatically rebalanced
* oLIT option token design is complex for users (liqLIT improves this)
* BPT 80/20 design & oLIT redemption create selling pressure on LIT token
* Reward are split between emissions from bribes + LM
* Bunni gauges can be killed if out of range ([Process](https://docs.bunni.pro/docs/guides/kill-gauge))

## Balancer & Aura:

As mentioned earlier, the existing Balancer pools are not being supported by Aave DAO yet and votes on GHO gauges depend on veBAL and vlAURA holders, mostly from contributors within each community. Moreover, GHO/USDC/USDT & GHO/LUSD are expected to be included in the SM at a later stage, but might need to create a base liquidity supported by the DAO before external votes fades away.

Both pools currently have classic gauges eligible for BAL rewards. According to recent changes from AIP-42, the budget allocated will be used to create vlAURA votes incentives on Warden Quest.

The initial strategy proposed is 400k vlAURA votes bribed to sustain 5% APR on a $5M TVL for each pool. The APR could be increased later on by using Aave voting power and blacklisting the DAO from the created Quests to attract more voters for the same cost.
 
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1m2iVIyp.png)
    
However, spending incentives on stableswap liquidity could be counter-effective before GHO peg is restored, so incentives might start after concentrated liquidity ones, and if the external support left.

Similar to Maverick & Bunni, since the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch, incentives will be deposited progressively to follow the liquidity growth. Nevertheless, 100% of the budget is spent in bribes so the unspent budget can be clawback on Warden Quest, enabling Aave DAO to pay a fixed price per vote for an important amount without overspending if the votes target isn’t reached.

As always, happy to fix potential mistakes in the strategies estimations if any.

The budget breakdown below contains two different margins:

* Assume that all strategies will begin to be incentivized at the same time, and with the maximum amount. It’s not what will happen but enables flexibility for the committee
* Assume that the bribe cost might increase and/or that more liquidity is needed on the different layers, so while the goal is not to spend it, a 20% buffer has been added to the committee budget (buffer not included in the above table)

* TokenLogic will provide analysis, estimation and monitoring of liquidity
* TokenLogic will facilitate the creation of liquidity pools not yet in production
* Liquidity Committee will implement on-chain transactions on-behalf of Aave DAO

The budget is divided into two main categories: concentrated liquidity pools (Maverick & Uniswap v3, Bunni & Liquis) and Balancer/Aura pools.

The budget breakdown assumes that all strategies will begin with maximum incentives at the same time, although this may not be the case in reality. A 20% buffer has been added to the committee budget to account for potential increases in bribe costs or increased liquidity needs on different layers.

Key points:
1. Incentives on stableswap liquidity could be counter-effective before GHO peg is restored, so incentives might start after concentrated liquidity ones.
2. If the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch, incentives will be deposited progressively to follow the liquidity growth.
3. 100% of the budget is spent in bribes, with any unspent budget being either deduced from the next budget request if the committee is renewed or sent back to the Aave DAO treasury.
4. TokenLogic will provide analysis, estimation, and monitoring of liquidity, as well as facilitating the creation of pools not yet in production.
5. The Liquidity Committee will implement on-chain transactions on behalf of Aave DAO.

## **Author: ACI**

## **Date: 2024-07-19**

> Proposal updated with Risk Params provided by Risk Service Providers. 2024-07-23

## **Summary:**

This ARFC seeks to add [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) Liquid Restaking Token weETH to Aave V3 on Scroll.

After the successful onboarding of weETH to [Aave v3 Ethereum](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=74&ipfsHash=0x227ef8b0f49775f64100ec697bc4e67b0739bd1ff08788b1f6b48a66e1d57bf7), [Arbitrum](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=76&ipfsHash=0x78778591515790b337fcdcc2a02d49dc58e98cad614c33d61e1173bc6194729d), and [Base](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboarding-of-weeth-to-aave-v3-on-base/17691), alongside recent Supply and Borrow Cap increases for weETH due to significant demand, this proposal will further increase the ability for Aave to service weETH demand from users.

This proposal will go direct-to-AIP following the asset onboarding framework.

## **Motivation:**

weETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer.

[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) has also launched weETH on Arbitrum and Base allowing L2 users to get exposure to LRT yield and points. As weETH has already been approved for onboarding to Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base by the DAO, this proposal extends the onboarding of weETH to Aave v3 on Scroll.

## **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:**

weETH deposits into Aave on Scroll will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) and EigenLayer points and Scroll Marks.

## **Specification:**

weETH on Scroll: [0x01f0a31698c4d065659b9bdc21b3610292a1c506](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x01f0a31698c4d065659b9bdc21b3610292a1c506)

title: [ARFC] Ethereum v2 Reserve Factor Adjustment
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic @ChaosLabs
created: 2024-02-27

---

# Summary

This publication proposes periodically increasing the Aave v2 Ethereum Reserve Factor (RF) to encourage users to migrate to Aave v3.

# Motivation

With Aave v3 now crossing the $8 Billion TVL threshold and $3 Billion remaining in Aave v2, this publication seeks to encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3 by increasing the RF.

With all other variables held constant, increasing the RF over time in isolation will result in a reducing deposit rate. Users are encourage to migrate to v3 in search of higher yield.

With market conditions permitting, we propose initiating a periodic 5.00% RF increase across all assets every 14 days as mentioned [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766) up to a threshold of 99.99%. During each increase cycle, we will monitor how users respond and, if any potential risks are identified, the next RF increase will be delayed until it is safe to implement.

Do note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect users' health factor, and this method has already been [implemented on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350) for some time. 

# Specification

The below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.

Title: [ARFC] Harmonize USDT Risk Parameters on Aave V3 Markets 
Author: Aave Chan Initiative
Created: 2023-11-11

---

# Summary

USDT has various risk parameters across the various Aave v3 markets. This proposals aims to harmonize the risk parameters to better align the markets by removing USDT from isolation mode and normalizing risk parameters.

# Motivation

USDT has seen strong borrow demand across networks with borrow utilization over 50% on Aave v3 Ethereum Mainnet and good utilization on secondary networks. However, the various markets currently have different risk parameters, leading to some inefficiency.

This proposal aims to bring the various USDT markets in line with a single set of LTV, liquidation threshold, and liquidation bonus parameters.

# Specification

The proposal sets the LT/LTV of USDT on all deployments at 80/77, matching that of DAI and USDC on v3 Ethereum. Regarding the LB, it will stay the same at 5% on the L2s and 4.5% on Ethereum.

# **Summary**

The current proposal seeks to increase the WETH Optimal Ratio across all Aave markets where it is below 90%. This adjustment aims to enhance capital efficiency and ensure a more effective utilization of liquidity within the Aave protocol.

# **Summary**

The current ARFC is set to gather all information regarding potential new Risk Service Provider for Aave DAO and allow governance to choose at ARFC Snapshot stage, which proposal shall move forward to AIP for final consideration as New Risk Service Provider alongside Chaos Labs.

# **Motivation**

Currently there are 3 different proposals for just one Risk Service Provider slot.

As agreed by community feedback, to optimize ressource allocation, Aave DAO will only have two Risk Service Providers. 

Currently, Chaos Labs is one of the Risk Service Provider, and the other slot will be represented by one of the current 3 teams that submitted different proposals previously in the form of TEMP CHECK.

It has been also decided to allow one ranked voting ARFC snapshot to allow governance to express their preference.

This proposal asks for approval of the community to define (keep or change) the pricing approach of WBTC on Aave.
The options are:
**1) keep the pricing of WBTC based on the underlying BTC, same as currently on Aave v2 Ethereum and other pools**
OR
**2) change the pricing model to use WBTC-based feeds**.

## Context
There has been extensive discussion on [https://governance.aave.com/t/wbtcs-and-others-pricing-mechanism-on-aave/10825](https://governance.aave.com/t/wbtcs-and-others-pricing-mechanism-on-aave/10825) about the topic, and with Aave v3 Ethereum upcoming, it is fundamental for the community to take a decision.

Generally, the risk entities currently engaged with the Aave community agree that using a WBTC/USD (or ETH) feed with option 2 can bring some benefits to the pool.
From the technical side, at BGD we think both options are perfectly legitimate, but when having enough liquidity (and WBTC seems to have it), usually it is better to price directly based on the asset itself.

## What the approval of this proposal implies?
Whatever option the community adopts will be applied on Aave v3 Ethereum. If the option selected is 2), we will work on adapting all other Aave instances to use the new pricing approach.

Given this proposal will authorise to already doing changes in production, the requirements are the same as on Level 1 of the Aave governance: 320k votes on the ""winning"" option and 80K differential between them.",bullish,53.0,2023-01-02 16:25:50+00:00,58.1,58.1,2023-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,9.62264150943396,54.95,0.0367924528301887,0.9260687232017516,True," The text proposes a decision for the community regarding the pricing approach of WBTC on Aave, with two options: keeping the current model based on BTC or changing to a model using WBTC-based feeds.

Both options are considered valid, but direct pricing based on the asset itself is preferred when there's enough liquidity.

Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative

Dated: 2023-01-31

# Simple Summary
This proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to add Aave Ethereum V3 support for the safety Module

# Abstract
The Safety Module is a set of smart contracts allowing AAVE & aBPT (representing Balancer V1 ETH/AAVE LP) token holders to stake their tokens in exchange for a share of the distribution of Safety Incentives sourced from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.

Stakers in the safety module, lock their liquidity for a minimum of 10 days, and in the case of a shortfall event affecting the covered Aave markets, expose their stake assets to be mobilized to cover excess protocol debt up to 30% of their staked funds.

This AIP proposes to extend the coverage of the Safety module to Aave V3 Ethereum Contracts.

# Motivation
Aave V3 is the most recent implementation of the Aave protocol, allowing new features, optimizations, and mitigation of risks.

Aave V3 has been battle tested for ~10 months in several networks, and its code was deemed safe enough to be allowed deployment on the Ethereum mainnet by the Aave governance.

The ACI is supportive of extending coverage of Aave V3 by the safety module in order to offer the V3 Ethereum users the same level of coverage as V2 users.

While the current version of the safety module has room for improvement and would benefit from a re-engineering and improved implementation, it’s the currently available tool, and the deployment of V3 makes it a suitable candidate to cover Aave V3 users on Ethereum.

# Specification
It is important to note that in the current implementation of the Safety module, a potential shortfall event needs to be implemented individually by an ad hoc AIP.

This proposal is then more a community guideline that sets precedence on Aave decision to support V3 in case of a shortfall event impacting the V3 market.

For this reason, this ARC, if consensus is found, can escalate to a snapshot vote but does not require a payload execution triggered by an AIP vote.

a Snapshot outcome thus would be considered canon without requiring an AIP on-chain vote with an empty payload.

title: [TEMP CHECK] stEUR Onboarding on Aave V3 Ethereum Pool
author: @marczeller - Aave-chan Initiative
date: 09-10-2023
---

## Summary

This TEMP CHECK proposes the onboarding of stEUR as a collateral-only asset on the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool. stEUR represents staked agEUR, a decentralized EUR-peg stablecoin minted by the Angle Protocol.

## Motivation

- **Decentralized Stablecoin Diversity**: At the ACI, we support the diversity of decentralized stablecoins. EUR stablecoins, in particular, are underrepresented in the ecosystem, and onboarding stEUR can help bridge this gap.
  
- **Growth in a Controlled Environment**: While stEUR and agEUR have relatively small market caps (5M$ and 20M$ respectively), onboarding stEUR as a collateral-only asset with limited caps will allow it to grow in a controlled environment, minimizing risks for the Aave protocol.

- **Collateral Potential**: stEUR, being a staked version of a decentralized EUR-peg stablecoin, presents a promising collateral candidate for Aave.

## Specification

- **Asset**: stEUR
- **Contract Address**: 0x004626A008B1aCdC4c74ab51644093b155e59A23

### Price Feed

For the price feed, we propose implementing a price adapter that calculates the value of stEUR based on the value of agEUR/USD and the exchange rate of agEUR/stEUR.

This replicates precedents such as with [sDAI](https://etherscan.io/address/0x29081f7aB5a644716EfcDC10D5c926c5fEe9F72B#code).

### Risk Parameters

We propose the following parameters for stEUR onboarding:

| Parameter             | Value       |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Isolation Mode        | No          |
| Borrowable            | No          |
| Borrowable in Iso     | No          |
| Stable Borrowing      | No          |
| Collateral Enabled    | Yes         |
| Supply Cap (stEUR)    | 3,000,000   |
| Borrow Cap (stEUR)    | 0           |
| Debt Ceiling          | N/A         |
| LTV                   | 70%         |
| LT                    | 75%         |
| LB                    | 8%          |
| LPF                   | 10%         |
| Reserve Factor        | 20%         |
| Base Rate             | 0%          |
| Slope 1               | 8%          |
| Slope 2               | 80%         |
| Optimal Ratio         | 80%         |

## Next Steps

1. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.
4. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provided feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
5. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

Title: [ARFC] Set ACI as Emission Manager for Liquidity Mining Programs 
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-06

---

# **Summary**

The current ARFC proposes to appoint the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) as the Emission Manager for liquidity mining programs across Aave markets. This will enable ACI to manage incentive programs funded by different partners, with the purpose of stimulating market activity and growth.

# **Motivation**

Liquidity mining programs are essential for attracting liquidity providers by offering rewards for their participation. Effective management of these programs is crucial for the sustained growth of the Aave Ecosystem. Therefore, ACI, with its extensive experience and strategic partnerships, is well-positioned to manage these emissions effectively.

A recent example is the [Long Term Incentive Program (LTIPP)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aave-ltipp-application-final/21741) from Arbitrum DAO, where Aave DAO will receive 750,000 ARB tokens, illustrating the benefits of coordinated emission management.

# **Specification**

1. Appointment of ACI as Emission Manager for Liquidity Mining Programs
    1. ACI will be authorized to manage Emission Programs for Liquidity Mining across Aave Markets.
    2. ACI’s multisig address will be the one receiving and distributing emissions on behalf of the DAO.
2. Appointment of ACI as coordinator with ecosystem partners, to define and implement emission strategies, managing the distribution of rewards to liquidity providers, and monitor & adjust emissions based on market performance.
3. Integration of Liquidity mining program as part of “Dolce Vita” service of the ACI at no extra cost for the DAO.

# Implementation

The ACI multisig address will be set as the emission manager via the **`setEmissionAdmin()`** method in the relevant emission manager contracts.

ACI multisig address: 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd

This method will appoint the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) wallet as the emissions admin for all potential Liquidity Mining Programs.

# Disclaimer

The ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.

# Next Steps

1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.

Title: [ARFC] Continuous Security Proposal Aave <> Certora
Author: @Shelly - Certora
Created: 2023-12-01

---

# Summary

We offer to extend the existing [formal verification and manual review services](https://governance.aave.com/t/security-and-agility-of-aave-smart-contracts-via-continuous-formal-verification/10181)  and provide additional security services:

1. Governance proposal reviews - Review every governance proposal in the on-chain stage as suggested by BGDLabs.
2. We will assist Aave and BGD in reviewing Immunify bug bounties per request.

This proposal asks for a 1-year duration with a budget of $1.5m, starting from the 14th of September 2023.

# Motivation

During the 18 months of services, we have reviewed 169 smart contacts consisting of over 51,289 Solidity lines. We have prevented 28 significant bugs. Full breakdown of our work can be found in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DOU1TniPHNmbrgz-Sy7zduoP9BJrsZkP_cTGRDuiwwg/edit#gid=967449577).

## Continuous Formal Verification (Auditing and Formal Verification integrated into CI)

Following the success of the collaboration in [the last 18 months](https://governance.aave.com/t/security-and-agility-of-aave-smart-contracts-via-continuous-formal-verification/10181/19), we offer to continue this service in the same format - new code is formally verified and manually reviewed. Our [open-source CVL specification rules](https://github.com/Certora/aave-verification-projects-TOC) are checked using the Certora Prover and become publicly available when the code is released. The formal tests are also integrated into Aave’s CI system to continuously check changes introduced into the code. Reports are delivered upon demand at the end of each project. We have recently released a [free version of the Certora Prover](https://www.certora.com/signup?plan=prover) and the community can use this to validate the outputs.

The Aave and BGD teams will play a key role in rule writing going forward. These teams are highly technical and have insights into high-level properties of the protocol. Our team will review these rules and ensure the Certora Prover can formally prove these rules or find a bug. Our team will add more rules and manually review the code.

## Governance Proposal Review
Following BGD’s suggestion to add a third party to the governance proposals verification process, we will allocate a dedicated team to review each proposal on the on-chain stage within 3.5 days.

Each proposal’s payload will be reviewed by the dedicated team, and we will verify that it does what it’s supposed to do according to its description/AIP. We will also check that there are no unwanted effects on the codebase, which is supposed to stay unchanged.

Our job will be done after a review by BGD at an earlier stage. BGD will also assist with onboarding to guarantee the highest quality of service.

## Incident Investigation Support Services
Triaging and validating all the incoming bug reports for a massive protocol, such as Aave, can be highly time-consuming and distracting for the developing entities. Many of the reported issues turn out to be benign. However, at the time of the report, the severity and feasibility of bugs are still unknown. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate them with full seriousness and urgency. We offer to establish an incident investigation support team available 24/7 to support emergency cases. In every incident, we will write a rule that confirms or rejects the existence of a bug and later use it to test the validity of the fix. After every incident, we will update the specifications and incorporate the new tests in the CI.

In past commitments, we have played a crucial role in two critical incident responses. In one case, we concluded that there was no bug in the system. In another case, we identified a missing rule, wrote it, and used it to catch a tricky bug in the suggested fix before the code was deployed.

# Specification

The annual price for the project is $1.5M: $1M is paid in GHO vested linearly over one year, and $500,000 is paid in Aave tokens vested linearly over one year. A 30-day termination is possible after a vote. We reduced the price of $2.7M from last year to reflect the bear market and inlined with the reduced project review capacity.

The Aave and the BGD team will also assist by writing their CVL rules.

# Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.
3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V3 AVAX. 

## Motivation

We recommend the following borrow caps for the Aave V3 AVAX Market. Borrow caps help prevent against high-risk attack vectors while sacrificing little capital efficiency. Our simulation analyses show that these borrow caps for these assets reduce the likelihood of market manipulation while allowing for natural organic borrow demand. As these markets naturally grow, we can continue to reassess raising caps incrementally.  

- FRAX borrow_cap: 2,000,000
- MAI borrow_cap: 2,000,000
- LINK borrow_cap: 220,000

**Title:** [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 deployment on BNB Chain.

**Author:** @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative

**Date:** 2023-03-22
- --

## **Simple Summary**

This Temperature Check seeks community input on the possibility of deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain to expand Aave's presence and tap into BNB Chain's growing DeFi ecosystem and user base.

## **Background**

BNB Chain is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. With a TVL of approximately $5 billion, BNB Chain is the third-largest chain by TVL. The chain has a diverse array of DeFi offerings, including prominent projects like PancakeSwap, Venus, and several others. Deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities.

## **Motivation**

Deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain has the potential to benefit both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and the potential for additional revenue. BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.

## **Specification**

This TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT. Suggested risk parameters for each asset are provided in the table below. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.

Title: [ARFC]  ACI Phase III - “Ad Astra”
Date: 2024-04-24
Author: MarcZeller - Aave-chan Initiative
---

## Summary:

This ARFC proposes the continuation of the collaboration with the Aave-chan Initiative (ACI) for an additional year, with a proposed budget of 1M GHO.

## Motivation


The ACI has demonstrated significant value to the Aave ecosystem across multiple fronts. The “initiative” launched ~18 months ago is now a team of 8 people strong, including various talents & providing multiple services, contributing to the DAO's success.
This proposal seeks to extend our collaboration for another year.

## ACI services:

The ACI service provider is now an 8-person team offering a variety of services for the Aave DAO. Here’s what we intend to maintain and improve during this proposal engagement:

### Skywards

Skywards has become the default option for the Aave governance as a whole, and the ACI is proud to keep delivering **first-class service to anyone upon simple request**. 

### Dolce Vita

Dolce Vita is the main “boring & invisible”  service of the ACI; “**Great service is often invisible, but bad service is immediately noticeable**” is our motto for Dolce Vita.

Aave DAO revenue is accrued, service provider coordination allows for increased efficiency, and third-party updates and integrations are done **without most community members realizing someone is doing the work in the background**. 

Dolce Vita might be the lesser-known of all the ACI’s services, but we believe it’s actually one of the most important. We’re happy to maintain, improve, and extend Dolce Vita services along with our continued engagement with the DAO.

### “Ad Astra”: (Growth)

We consider Growth and Business Development to be the core of ACI services. We coordinated, contributed to, and created numerous proposals to improve the Aave DAO revenue, and the results are clear. The **Aave DAO has never been as profitable as it is now**, and the **DAO net profits have largely overperformed the market conditions**.

The Aave DAO is the second most profitable DAO, and together, we fully intend **to become the most profitable DAO on earth**.

This part of our work is also made possible thanks to collaboration with key DAO actors in this vertical, **such as TokenLogic and Karpatkey**. We’re glad to work with them every day, and we all have our own domains of expertise, creating value synergies for this DAO.

**Growth and BD are part of ACI’s DNA**. We intend to maintain and extend our contributions in this vertical.

### Representation:

The ACI is now an impactful voice for the DAO. The ACI is known to support and defend the Aave DAO’s **best interests internally and externally**.

We consider that our “chainsaw” arc contributed to making the Aave DAO one of the most efficient and profitable DAOs in the world and to Aave maintaining its leader position in our vertical.

That being said, we fostered numerous synergistic initiatives to build bridges with the community and attract new users: Merit was a large success for GHO growth & Aave market share growth, APE integrated the DAO as an Arbitrum governance player and **contributed to a 750k $ARB LTIP grant** to support GHO and the **ACI represented the DAO across the globe participating, speaking & sponsoring numerous events**.

With this continuation proposal, we intend to remain a strong voice for the DAO and remain active both onchain & offchain in conferences. At the time of writing, we have **confirmed participation at Dappcon, EthCC, and Devcon** for the next few months.

## Specifications

Proposal duration: 365 Days
Proposal Budget: 1M GHO

Note: this proposal is intended to be a continuation of ACI’s previous streams due to governance mandatory delays to avoid a “gap” in ACI’s engagement, if this proposal is favored by aave governance votes, the AIP payload stream duration will be adjusted to reflect an engagement from May 5th, 2024.

## Next Steps

1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.
3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

281,474,1009,1009,1009,2023-07-12 14:00:53+00:00,aave,"**Title: [ARFC] GHO Steward: Agile Parameter Changes**

**Author: [@AaveCompanies](https://governance.aave.com/u/aavecompanies)**

**Date: 12th July 2023**

## **Summary**

This ARFC proposes implementing the dedicated GHO Steward as a dynamic parameter change mechanism to ensure efficient risk management and support the peg of Aave Protocol’s native multi-collateral stablecoin GHO during the initial stages.

## **Motivation**

### **Introduction**

As the Aave DAO prepares for the introduction of GHO, it is crucial for the community to consider implementing a mechanism that offers greater agility to adjust risk parameters in the initial stages of launch.

To support the maintenance of the peg, the proposed GHO Steward multisig acts as a dynamic parameter change mechanism. It enables swift adjustments to risk parameters in the form of scoped governance delegation where the full governance process could potentially be time-consuming and hinder timely response to evolving circumstances.

By employing this mechanism, the Aave Protocol ensures transparency and enables flexible parameter changes through decentralized governance. This approach reinforces commitment to preserving the peg and effectively addressing market challenges that may arise upon the launch of GHO.

### **Key Terms**

The “bucket capacity” refers to the maximum amount of GHO that can be minted by a Facilitator. The ability to adapt the bucket capacity by adjusting supply supports stability by ensuring that available supply meets demand.

The “borrow rate” refers to the interest rate paid when borrowing GHO. The borrowing rate may also be used to support stability because of its impact on demand.

You can learn more about GHO in the docs [here](https://docs.gho.xyz/).

### **GHO Steward Permissions**

Aave V3 provides a high level of granularity around permissions. Building on the concept of [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/4), it is proposed that a dedicated GHO Steward multisig be introduced to support the initial GHO governance risk mechanism to enable the implementation of agile parameter changes in the form of scoped governance delegation.

The GHO Steward multisig would be 2/2 and would include the DAO’s risk providers Chaos Labs and Gauntlet.

The GHO Steward would be capable of adjusting predefined parameters including: increasing the bucket capacity (by up to 100%) and changing the borrow rate (by up to 100 basis points in either direction) in a single change. Parameter updates could only occur once every 5 days per the parameter.

It is proposed that the GHO Steward would be deactivated 90 days after the passing of this proposal. However, the DAO can vote to renew the GHO Steward for another 90 days if deemed necessary. The DAO can also vote to remove the GHO Steward at any time.

### **Governance Process**

This proposal emphasizes the importance of decentralization and community involvement in the decision-making process, fostering a robust and inclusive ecosystem. The GHO Risk Steward would enable agile parameter changes for GHO; however, decisions shouldn’t be made in isolation and should go through a lean governance process.

The proposed lean process is as follows:

1. Proposal on the Governance Forum explaining the rationale of the proposed action.
2. Snapshot requirements:
    
    a. 24-hour duration starting from the posting of the proposal
    
    b. Quorum 250,000 AAVE
    
    c. A minimum of 70% of votes FOR the change
    
3. Change can be enacted as soon as the proposal passes Snapshot.

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the GHO Steward serves as an initial agile parameter change mechanism driven by decentralized governance. It highlights the Aave Protocol’s commitment to maintaining GHO stability and addressing market challenges during the launch period.

While the proposal acknowledges the potential for a more dynamic rate-changing governance model in the future, the current framework allows the DAO to effectively manage GHO’s parameters in the short term.

## **Specification**

### **Capabilities:**

1. **Capacity Increase:** It can increase the bucket capacity by up to 100%. This is strictly an upward adjustment; the capacity cannot be decreased by the GHO Steward.
2. **Borrow Rate Adjustment:** It can adjust the borrow rate by up to 1%, either upwards or downwards.

### **Configuration:**

1. **Permissions:** The GHO Steward is granted PoolAdmin in the Aave Protocol and BucketManager for the GHO token.
2. **Risk Council:** This Multisig is solely responsible for triggering actions through the GHO Steward contract. The address of this entity cannot be changed.
3. **Execution Time Delay:** Any parameter change made by the GHO Steward contract, such as increasing bucket capacity or adjusting the borrow rate, is limited to once within the time delay period. e.g.,GHO Steward can only change a parameter once 5 days have passed since the last parameter change for that specific parameter.
4. **Lifespan:** The GHO Steward contract will initially only have a lifespan of 90 days. The lifespan is designed to ensure regular review of the necessity of this approach.
5. **Steward Lifespan Extension:** The DAO can extend the lifespan of the GHO Steward for additional 90-day periods as many times as it wants.

The first proposal discussed here https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v3-launch-strategy-code-licensing/6316 is related to the code licensing of Aave V3.
The discussion was passionate and gravitated around three possibilities:

- **Business License**: The business license would be implemented in a similar fashion as Uniswap, where the code usage would be restricted for an initial amount of time (tentatively one year) before becoming free. This would likely require some additional legal work and slow down the V3 release process. A legal representative of the DAO must be elected or the DAO needs to be incorporated.

The idea around the Business License is that the Aave Governance would keep the rights to authorize code forks even during the initial period with projects and teams that show great collaboration and participation in the Aave Ecosystem.

- MIT: Aave V3 would be released under the MIT license

- (A)GPL: Aave V3 would be released under the (A)GPL license

Title: MakerDAO Multi-Collateral Dai onboarding on the AAVE Arc Market

Status: Proposal

Authors: @zxMori_MakerDAO, on behalf of the MakerDAO Growth CU


Abstract
This proposal aims to jumpstart the onboarding process for Multi Collateral Dai on the Aave Arc Market. Dai is a stablecoin backed by multiple collateral types, mainly ETH, WBTC and other stablecoins such as USDP (Paxos Dollar) and USDC (Circle USD Coin).

Collateralization components of Dai on 2021-12-27. See more at https://daistats.com

Maker users can open positions in the protocol, mint Dai against their collateral and are able to either hold Dai or use it to leverage yield farming opportunities on the DeFi space.

Dai’s position in the markets
Dai is the premiere stablecoin available for use in DeFi protocols. It, being crypto-native allows users to borrow an amount of stablecoins leveraging their crypto positions, without the need to sell their volatile assets. This allows for a wide range of use cases, from simple stable borrowing to complex leveraged positions, enabled by the Maker Protocol.

The amount of Dai in circulation as of 2021-12-27 amounts to ~$9.3B, making it the biggest crypto native stablecoin on offer in the market. Due to this, many protocols on the Ethereum ecosystem (and on sidechains such as Polygon, Avalanche, and Fantom) accept Dai positions.

Dai services for institutions
MakerDAO has facilities for institutional clients to leverage their own positions (either crypto, via regular vaults - or real-world assets via RWA vaults 1). This proposal, thus, aligns with our institutional offerings - since having Dai on a permissioned market that institutions can enter will allow them to get right into into DeFi products without having to jump through hoops to stay in the clear KYC-wise.

We’ve already onboarded several financial institutions to the DeFi space, including Societé Generale (borrowing Dai against government-issued bonds), Nexo (offering our Vault solution to their platform’s users) - so we think a MakerDAO x AAVE collaboration for institutional clients is right on theme for both projects’ stance on institutional support.

Specification
Multi-Collateral Dai should be whitelisted for use on the Aave Arc Market. The address of the token on the Ethereum Main Network is 0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f",bullish,166.2,2022-02-05 17:22:21+00:00,184.2,184.2,2022-02-07 00:00:00+00:00,10.83032490974729,177.8,0.0697954271961493,0.8917224407196045,True," This text discusses a proposal for integrating Multi-Collateral Dai into the AAVE Arc Market. The proposal aims to facilitate the onboarding process of Dai, a stablecoin backed by various collateral types, in the Aave market. Dai is widely used in DeFi protocols due to its crypto-native nature, allowing users to borrow stablecoins using their cryptocurrency positions without selling volatile assets. The proposal also mentions institutional support for Dai, with several financial institutions already onboarded to DeFi, and suggests a collaboration between MakerDAO and AAVE for institutional clients.",bullish,medium

Title: [ARFC] Orbit Program Renewal May 2024 
Date: 2024-05-13
Author: Marc Zeller - Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)
---

## Summary

Proposing the renewal of the Orbit program for recognized delegates, compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement of Gas costs associated with their governance activity.

## Motivation

Orbit recognizes the added value of the Delegates in the decentralization & diversity of the Aave DAO. This compensation allows them to focus on aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance. The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter.

With the transition to Governance V3, a significant feature introduced is gasless voting via Gelato integration on the [DAO-run governance app](https://vote.onaave.com), making it easier for delegates to participate without the burden of gas costs. This innovation prompts the proposal to discontinue the general gas rebate program. However, recognizing the continued necessity for proposal creation and payload deployment activities, we propose maintaining targeted gas rebates for these specific actions.

## Specification

* **Period Coverage:** Blocks 19162697 (5th Feb 2024) to Block 19860031 (May 13th 2024)
* **Eligible Platforms:**
	+ EzR3al
	+ Stable Labs
	+ Saucy Block
	+ Areta
* **Gas Rebate:** Since this period is entirely covered by Governance V3, the Orbit program does not reimburse delegate vote gas as their vote is now subsidized by Gelato. We will continue to reimburse Service Providers for their Governance-related activity:

   + ACI : 2.74 ETH
   + TokenLogic : 0.641 ETH

* **Budget:** 60000 GHO and 3.381 ETH
* **Relevant Links:**

+ [ACI's Orbit tracker](https://apps.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker)


## Next Steps
1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2. If consensus is achieved, move this proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.
3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage for implementation and funding allocation in cooperation with Aave Finance service providers via an ad-hoc AIP vote or bundled in one of their treasury management AIPs.

## Summary

This proposal suggests deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on providing liquidity for weETH holders to borrow stablecoins.

## Motivation

The demand for borrowing wETH on Aave using weETH as collateral is extremely high, with caps being filled within minutes each week.

While this $2B growth is welcomed and responsible for ~$12.5M yearly revenue (at current ETH prices) for the DAO, it has created some frustration for significant users looking to borrow stablecoins using their weETH as collateral.

With this asset being constantly at cap, users are wary of leveraging Aave for this use case as they have legitimate concerns about their ability to add more collateral/debt to (de)leverage following market conditions.

To provide weETH holders with more suitable options, we propose creating a dedicated weETH/stablecoin Aave v3 Instance.

This market also lays the groundwork for future integrations & synergies with EtherFi’s Cash product.

## Specification

The proposed weETH/Stablecoin Aave v3 instance will implement the following:

- The market will include weETH, USDC, pyUSD, FRAX.

- This market will not have E-Mode, but due to its focused nature and limitation of cross-collaterals, it’s proposed to have a higher LTV/LT status for weETH than for the main instance.

The risk steward will dynamically adjust weETH supply caps based on stablecoin liquidity to ensure stablecoin borrowing remains viable.

In addition, we propose that the Aave DAO consider the following:

- Introduce a stablecoin deposit incentive program to kickstart stablecoin liquidity in this new instance using Merit or other initiatives to be discussed.

# Summary

This publication mainly proposes consolidating DAO assets in preparation of foreseeable DAO expenses. There are additional small  treasury management actions included in this proposal for house-keeping.

# Motivation

In preparation for the upcoming launch of the Merit program and the expected renewal of DAO service providers, this proposal intends to:

* Consolidate the DAOs smaller holdings to GHO
* Swap larger stablecoins holdings for GHO
* Replenish the stablecoins Reserves in Aave v3
* Migrate funds from Aave v2 to v3
* Bridge funds from Polygon to Mainnet

To reduce governance burden, this proposal also includes withdrawing BAL and CRV from mainnet Aave v3 and v2, as well as withdrawing and bridging them from Polygon Aave v3 to Ethereum. All the BAL and CRV included in this proposal will then be transferred to the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) for its future allocation on behalf of the DAO.

In addition to the above, this proposal seeks to enable @karpatkey_TokenLogic to submit proposals via the Direct-to-AIP process which include actions similar to the above:

* Consolidate treasury holdings to GHO 
* Migrate funds from v2 to v3 deployments
* Move funds from Polygon to Ethereum

# Specification

The table below summarises the tasks to be performed by this proposal:

### Part A

title: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Introducing StrategicAssetManager 
author: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic, @dydymoon & Fermin
created: 2023-07-05

---

# Summary

The `StrategicAssetManager` is a dedicated contract for managing Aave DAO's strategic assets. At launch the `StrategicAssetManager` will manage the DAO's veBAL holding.

# Motivation

Aave DAO is soon to attain a veBAL holding. To maximise the upside for holding the strategic asset, the DAO needs a practical means of managing the asset.

The veBAL holding needs to be continually relocked to optimise goverance and rewards. Gauge votes are weekly and would require numerous AIPs to manage the veBAL effectively. Aave DAO also has an opportunity to participate in Balancer's governance on Snapshot votes via delegating governance rights.

The StrategicAssetManage will also hold the sdCRV position if approved by AIP. Yield generated from each strategic holding can be claimed, swapped and redeposited to compound into each strategy over time. The swaps have MEV protection and can be customised to have defined maximum amount of price impact.

Given the sheer volume and frequency of transactions to be performed, there exists a desire to minimum AIP votes. The StrategicAssetManager contains the ability for the `ShortExecutor` to assign an `AssetManager`. This role can be likened to a Treasury Committee (as suggested Part 4 of SM upgrade publications) and provides the DAO optionality to introduce a committee separte from this proposal once adequate guidelines are in place. 

The contract contains an allow list which implements tight restrictions around which contracts the `AssetManager` role can interact with. Further definition relating to what the `AssetManager` can do will be defined in the [ARFC] publication.

# Specification

The below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the StrategicAssetManager:

* Deposit/withdraw voteEscrow contract 
* Lock/relock B-80BAL-WETH
* Participate in gauge votes
* Delegate governance voting rights
* Allocate boost
* Update boost
* Delegate boost
* Allow boost on Warden 
* List boost on Warden (if the  DAO votes for it)
* Claim protocol fees & other rewards 
* Transfer assets (ie: collector contracts)
* Ability to lock other strategic assets
* Receive assets from the collector
* Receive assets from the Economic Reserve

The contract is upgradeable and controlled by Aave's [`Short Executor`](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/governance-guide#the-short-executor-is-used-for-non-governance-related-proposals-such-as-asset-listing-parameter-upda) role via governance. Each function on the contract can be implemented via the `ShortExecutor` whilst also having the ability to assign and remove, a `AssetManager` role to a community elected address. There is also the possibility of having an IncentiveManager contract that could take on some of the listed functions defined above. These details will be worked through in the future.

# Next Steps

Upon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance. The [ARFC] 
publication will provide greater insights to the functions on the contract and the Treasury Committee will be a separate [ARFC].

Author: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham 
Created: 21-08-2022

## Simple Summary

In response to Tribe DAO’s proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes redeeming all aFEI for FEI and exchanging it for DAI. 

## Abstract

The Aave DAO currently holds around 619,185.82 units of aFEI in the Ethereum Reserve Factor. Due to the uncertainty around the future of Tribe DAO and FEI, this proposal presents the community the opportunity to reduce exposure to the FEI stablecoin.  

If other lenders move to redeem aFEI for FEI before Aave DAO acts, then there is a risk that Aave DAO becomes trapped as a lender of last resort. Due to this risk, this proposal strongly encourages the DAO to redeem aFEI for FEI as an immediate priority.

After redeeming the aFEI for FEI, risk can be further reduced by redeeming or swapping the FEI holding for a stablecoin with a more certain future. In this proposal, we suggest redeeming the FEI for DAI via the Tribe DAO Peg Stability Module which will incur a 0.03% fee.

## Motivation

The FEI lending market is a concentrated market with three main providers of liquidity. Tribe DAO, Aave DAO and Badger DAO make up the top three liquidity providers by providing 88.76%, 5.47% and 2.72% respectively. Fei Labs has proposed redeeming all aFEI for FEI which will remove [10,067,143.35](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaFBd7Bd91B4c1Dd289EE47a4F030FBeDfa7ABc12) units of FEI from the lending market. However, there are only ​​[9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units of FEI held within the lending market.

Fei Labs is unable to withdraw all of its FEI as there is insufficient liquidity, redeem amount [10,067,143.35](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaFBd7Bd91B4c1Dd289EE47a4F030FBeDfa7ABc12) > available liquidity​​ [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3). This is a problem for Fei Labs and also other lenders.

The market currently supports [11,308,536.17](https://etherscan.io/token/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units of aFEI, with 2,275,205.37 units of debt and [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units available for lenders to redeem their collateral from or for Users to borrow. Any User seeking to claim [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) or less is able to do so now, but this may change very quickly when Fei Labs or others starts redeeming aFEI causing liquidity to diminish.

Aave DAO has 619,185.82 units of aFEI at risk of being caught in an illiquid position. If the FEI held within the lending market falls below 619,185.82 units before Aave DAO redeems its position, it will become a trapped lender until such time as borrowers repay their loans. It is likely that as this market is unwound by large liquidity providers redeem aFEI, that the utilisation and interest rate will increase, which hopefully triggering borrowers to repay loans.

This proposal has been put in motion to try to prevent Aave DAO becoming a trapped lender in the FEI market by redeeming its aFEI before liquidity dries up. We encourage all Users of the market to take responsible action in light of recent events.

Once the aFEI has been redeemed for FEI, it is to be redeemed for DAI. Tribe DAO offers a DAI PSM with a 0.03% fee that facilitates redeeming FEI for DAI. This is a simple solution and one [supported by the Tribe DAO community](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475) as part of the transition to a terminal state. The DAI PSM module has around $14.5M of liquidity at the time of writing and can be tracked [here](https://dune.com/queries/1187683). In the event that redeeming FEI for DAI runs into any issues, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve. There is a bonding curve at peer review stage for swapping USDC for BAL which can be amended to facilitate offloading FEI into the spot market. We will provide updates in the comments as the situation unfolds.

## Specification

The below provides a broad, high level summary of how the aFEI position held within the Reserve Factor will be managed.

* All of the aFEI held with the Ethereum Economic Reserve is to be redeemed for FEI.
* All FEI will be redeemed for DAI via the Tribe DAO DAI PSM
  * If any issue arises, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve
* DAI will be held in the Ethereum Reserve Factor

## Next Steps

The next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the **earliest 25th August 2022**, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to proceed as outlined above at the earliest possible date **29th August 2022**.

If we can move quicker than the proposed dates above, please do let reach out.

title: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Create and Fund GHO Liquidity Committee
Author: @TokenLogic
Dated: 2023-09-08

---

# Summary

This publication presents Aave DAO the opportunity to create and fund the GHO Liquidity Committee for an initial 3 month duration.

# Motivation

Over the coming weeks, we expect the voting base to reallocate gauge votes away from GHO liquidity pools. This is largely due to those voting for GHO pools incurring an opportunity cost by not participating in the bribe market.

If the Aave DAO was to lock all of its BPT for veBAL, the gauge vote is equivalent to 1.8% of veBAL. Even with some voters continuing to support GHO, a good portion of the 7.7% will move to other pools. There is also the impact of [AIP-42](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682) for the DAO to consider. Voting support from external teams is expected to taper beyond what Aave DAO can replace with its own strategic assets. Furthermore, as the liquidity pools continue to grow additional gauge voting support is required to maintain the APR over time. Whilst the Aave Safety Module (SM) has the potential to be a more long term sustained solution, integrating BPTs that contain GHO, this requires time to develop and should not be rushed.

Meanwhile, the [GHO price](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/) is consistently trading between 96 cents and 99 cents. When the liquidity in the GHO/Aave Boosted Pool was withdrawn, the GHO peg improved. This is because the pool was >85% GHO and had minimal USDC, USDT and DAI deposits. Increasing the GHO borrow rate is also expected to support the GHO peg as minting GHO to farm rewards in liquidity pools is less profitable.

![|602x231](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7_4E7_tF8xRZe5tUFyoeXnJB3UbWDs7C7aGaohFzMjxM_aBGLmMvAREOjrtIS5yppMcrUaov3Q18-jIGcnjJk4x17wy91VheIUZSkIa0Y2a9Ay_kLTLRZ0w6zKR8PEpjE3jqJIBPzfF)

The LUSD/GHO pool on Maverick, is also heavily concentrated in GHO and migrating this liquidity to a wider liquidity band pool is expected to also help support the peg.

Creating several concentrated liquidity pools is expected to help improve the GHO peg. These pools will have wide and narrow ranges. Liquidity will need to be migrated from the wide range to the narrow range pool over time. This will require more active management than what on-chain governance allows.

The recent CRV acquisition indicates the DAO will likely be supporting a GHO/crvUSD pool on Curve Finance. The current CRV holding can be used to kick start a pool, however additional support is likely to be needed to continue growing the pool. There is also a GHOFRAXBP pool being setup by the Frax team which can be co-incentivised. Pending how these pools progress, additional scope/budget may be added at a later stage.

Given the time sensitive nature of needing to support GHO liquidity, this publication proposes creating a Liquidity Committee with an initial budget. The committee shall focus solely on GHO liquidity and shall consist of a relatively small highly skilled team.

The Liquidity Committee can support GHO whilst other initiatives are being considered. Even after GHO liquidity pool receipt tokens are integrated into the SM, the Liquidity Committee can participate in bribe markets to boost the yield on the SM integrations.

Longer term the DAO should revisit the impact of the committee and determine if it is still required. Furthermore, the composition of the committee should be revisited at a late date. With this in mind, this proposal suggests the Liquidity Committee’s initial mandate shall last for a 3 month duration.

# Liquidity Strategy

Details on the liquidity strategy are to be detailed in a separate forum post. The liquidity strategy is to be implemented on the following Decentralise Exchanges:

* Balancer
* Maverick
* Uniswap via Bunni

This forum post is to focus on the creation of the Liquidity Committee and associated fundings.

# Performance Measures

The following performance measures are proposed:

* Time GHO peg is above 98.5 cents and 99.0 cents
  * % above/below 98.5 cents over trailing 7 days
  * % above/below 99.0 cents over trailing 7 days
* TVL in GHO Pools on Maverick
  * Target $5M
* TVL in GHO Pools on Uniswap
  * Target $5M
* Improvement in swap size for defined price impact via Cowswap or Paraswap
  * 0.25% and 0.5% price impact to USDC
* TVL in Balancer Liquidity Pools

Target $10M ($5M per pool)

These measures will be shown on the GHO Analytics platform provided by TokenLogic.

# Committee Structure

The Liquidity Committee is to consist of 7 signers and will utilise a 4 of 7 SAFE to implement transactions. To ensure there is smooth operational consistency, there are distinct roles within the committee.

TokenLogic will perform the following function:

* Provide analytics and modelling of the liquidity strategy
* Liaise with teams that support the protocols hosting the GHO liquidity
* Lead & Coordinate the committees weekly activities

All signers are to provide the following support:

* Provide critical feedback / help refine the strategy
* Verify and sign transactions

It should be noted, that actively managing liquidity takes time and effort to stay up to date with the attest events happening across all the protocols supporting GHO liquidity. Verifying transactions as a signer is also a notable time commitment.

# Budget

The initial 3 months funding for the Liquidity Committee is as shown below:

* 406,000 GHO - Liquidity Incentives
* 5 ETH - Gas

A breakdown of the Liquidity Incentive budget is shown below:
![|602x224](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B_P69n971i9uu38kLAiBQKpiESXHTZJc__Q6PKuvWCxxp7ZaHn7zU-eEVpFSHFcD1W2ZurPx49T-W4Dg0fY25krVHC07nZ0_XCQtyylq9LPafWuxv-G4Ca-19mWfE2-URZ-6BL94nIhH)

A more detailed breakdown of the incentive budget and strategy can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801).

There is a nominal 5 ETH allowance included in the budget. This amount was arbitrarily selected and ensures the SAFE & signing wallets are well funded.Some transactions can be executed directly from the SAFE.

**Author:** @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative

**Date:** 2023-04-04

## **Summary:**

This ARFC proposes the offboarding of Aave V1 by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on the platform, encouraging users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3.

## **Abstract:**

This proposal outlines a plan to offboard Aave V1 by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on the platform, making borrowing and supplying less attractive on Aave V1 and encouraging users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3.

## **Motivation:**

Aave V1 has been an essential platform in the DeFi ecosystem, but with the release of Aave V2 and Aave V3, it is necessary to shift users and resources towards these more advanced and efficient platforms. Offboarding Aave V1 and encouraging migration to newer versions will ensure a more streamlined user experience and concentrate resources on continued development and improvements in the Aave ecosystem.

## **Specification:**

The offboarding plan will be executed by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on Aave V1. These rate strategies aim to incentivize users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3 by making borrowing and supplying less attractive on Aave V1. The new rate strategies will be applied to all assets listed on Aave V1.

### **New Rate Strategies:**
For each asset listed on Aave V1, new proposed values for the following parameters will be implemented:

- uOptimal: 20%
- reserveFactor: 99.9%
- base rate: 3%
- slope 1: 7%
- slope 2: 200%

These changes will make borrowing and supplying assets on Aave V1 less attractive compared to Aave V2 or Aave V3, encouraging users to migrate their assets to newer platforms.

## **Next Steps:**

1. If approved, submit the proposal as an AIP for on-chain governance approval.

## Background
The discussion about Aave on Starknet [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deploying-aave-on-starknet/6726).


## Introduction
A proposal to start bootstrapping the Aave ecosystem over Starkware has received good support from the Aave community, as it allows to expand to a new and promising environment, following the lead of Aave v3 with rollups.

This bootstrapping was proposed to be executed in 2 phases: an initial one getting in touch with the new technology, while still building something valuable for the Aave and Starknet communities; and a second one, more ambitious, most probably porting Aave v3 to Starknet.

As the facilitator of the project, I outline on this document the details of Phase I, including scope, time estimation, team members and budget allocation request from the Aave DAO.


## Phase I. Scope

### The project. aTokens bridge
As explained on the initial post, the target of the initial Phase is simplicity, while adding value for the communities.

One of the options was to create some kind of pooling model, for people to deposit and withdraw from Aave Ethereum without ever touching Ethereum and its (current) high gas cost. Since that initial proposal, the idea has been refined together with the built team.

Phase I will pursue the same goals as the original pooling idea, but this will be done by building wrappers and smart contracts around the canonical Starknet bridges, for the aTokens of Aave Ethereum. Following similar idea as pioneered by Aavegotchi with maTokens, together with some extra bridging infrastructure on both the Ethereum and Starknet sides, this model will allow to:

Build the basic blocks for products to integrate easily with Aave from Starknet. Including smart contracts and interaction libraries.
Solve some interesting and useful challenges, like cross-chain liquidity mining.
Boost Starknet’s user base, by providing Aave facilities.
Keep simplicity.
In terms of user flow, the system will provide smart contracts infrastructure to:

Users entering on Starknet via CEXes or on-ramp services to deposit on Aave Ethereum, just by buying an aToken equivalent on Starknet.
Same for withdrawals, by selling the aToken equivalent on Starknet.
New opportunities to liquidity providers to build on top of that, potentially monetising the movement of liquidity between Ethereum and Starknet.


### Timeline
The project is estimated to take a total of 2 to 3 months, with the variability depending on the implementation of the most experimental aspects, like the cross-chain liquidity mining.

As part of the facilitator role, I will post bi-weekly updates on the state of the project, informing the community on the progress on all aspects.

A more detailed timeline is the following:
![Timeline](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/7edbf24a3327584d6bdd5a4da617a801dfd85ba8.jpeg)

The project start will be marked by the execution of the on-chain proposal requesting the initial funds of the project.

### Team
Since the initial proposal, multiple teams showed interest on participating on the project. Considering the final scope, the team will be formed by:

- 1 facilitator of the project, part-time.
- 1 frontend/backend developer, part-time.
- 3 Cairo/Solidity developers, full-time.
- 1 Solidity developer part-time (depending on availability and need).
- **Total**: 3 full time and 2-3 part time.
The team is balanced to have expertise on the Aave ecosystem and Starknet.

### Budget breakdown
Salaries. Covering the full scope of the project, estimated for 3 months and to not be modified unless the final timeline is too short (>1.5 month less) or too long (>1.5 month long).
Gas cost. For deployments of contracts, plus all managerial efforts concerning mainly the payments from the Aave DAO.
Audit. We plan to engage 2 audit firms, both with EVM/Solidity expertise and at least one with Starknet/Cairo experience.
Bug bounty. Maximum to be spent, but most probably over-estimated if no important issues are found.
Buffer. 10% of the total budget.

### Payments
For the Starkware part, the payments will be managed as coordinated between the Starknet team, the facilitator and the team members.

For the Aave part, 2 payments are proposed, to be requested via proposals on the Aave governance:

At the start of the project, 100’000$ to cover mainly fixed expenses.
Before starting audits (beginning Month 3), $92’500.
Any reconciliation of budget (e.g. return unused funds) will be done at the end of the project, with the bug bounty being kept by the team during 1 year, and then returned to the governance if not used.

Given the nature of the development, the payment will be done on stable assets from the Aave treasury.

### Deliverables
Smart contracts (Ethereum/Starknet) for wrapping and bridging of aTokens, fully open source and with a permissive license like MIT.
Full documentation of the codebase, architecture and model in general.
Public audits.
Continuous update to the community about the project.

### Next steps
- This Snapshot proposal to ratify the project.
- If passed, create on-chain proposal to request the initial funds.

Title: [ARC] SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool
Staus: Proposal
Author: @llamaxyz @MatthewGraham
Dated: 2022-11-14

---

# Simple Summary

@llamaxyz proposed assigning the SD `Emission_Admin` role on the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool to a Gnosis Safe controlled by the Stader Labs.

# Abstract

The Stader Labs team intends to distribute SD incentives to the MaticX Reserve on Polygon Aave v3.

In order to achieve this, the `EmissionManager` contract needs to assign an owner to the `Emission_Admin` permission allowing SD rewards to be distributed, [1,2]. This can only be achieved via the governance process.

This proposal assigns the `Emission_Admin` permission to SD rewards to the following address `matic:0x51358004cFe135E64453d7F6a0dC433CAba09A2a`.

# Motivation

The motivation of the proposal is to enable SD rewards to be distributed on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.

Please do note a similar request was submitted enabling the distribution of LDO and stMATIC rewards by Lido and the Polygon Foundation respectively across the Polygon Aave v3 liquidity pool, [3,4].

# Specification

The Stader Labs team will determine the emission rate and duration SD rewards are offered. This will likely be influenced by the Aave DAO’s ability to adjust the wMATIC and MaticX risk parameters that enable users to generate a return from leverage the MaticX / wMATIC loop.

The `Emission_Admin` is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool. The `EmissionManager` role grants the SD `Emission_Admin` role to a specified wallet address. The `Emission_Admin` can distribute SD rewards across the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool.

# Implementation

Set `Emission_Admin` permission for SD (`matic:0x1d734A02eF1e1f5886e66b0673b71Af5B53ffA94`) on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool to Stader Lab’s address: `matic:0x51358004cFe135E64453d7F6a0dC433CAba09A2a`, [5,6].

title: ARC: Avalanche Market - AVAX Risk Parameters Update
status: WIP
author: @MatthewGraham from Index Coop and @ChrisG from Defi Pulse
created: 28-01-2022

# Simple Summary
We propose adjusting two (2) AVAX risk parameters on the Aave Avalanche Market: LTV and Liquidation Threshold.

# Abstract
This proposal updates two AVAX risk parameters on the Aave Avalanche Market to align with the Moderate risk level chosen by the Aave community. Index Coop has compiled the following analysis for Gauntlet and the broader Aave community to review.

# Motivation
Updating the AVAX parameters seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

# Specification
The criteria for assessing market risk, as determined by the market size and changes in fluctuation in demand, is presented by the Aave community here. In line with the criteria, analysis of the AVAX token on Avalanche network is presented below (data as of Jan. 23, 2021):

AVAX Avalanch Market Risk (Coingecko Data)

|Holders:|1.8 m|A|B+|

|Mkt Cap|$15 bn|A+|
|Avg. Volume 1m|$860 m|B+|
|Avg. Volume 3m|$1.14 bn|B+|
|Norm. Volatility|6.21%|B-|

The AVAX token risk score compiled by Index Coop is B+.

Holders are estimated by the cumulative address count.

Market Cap is calculated using circulating supply.

The Norm. volatility parameter is the average of the t=30 days and t=90 days as shown in the below table.

AVAX Volatility Data (Coingecko Data)

|Time|S.D. of daily log returns|
| --- | --- |
|t=7 days|6.21%|
|t=30 days|5.54%|

A proposal for a series of Reserve Factor (RF) increases across all V2 Ethereum assets.

## Motivation

In line with our [V2 to V3 migration plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636), we propose a series of RF increases on Aave V2 Ethereum.

By progressively increasing the reserve factors, the interest rate for supplying these assets on V2 will be increasingly less attractive, thus encouraging suppliers to transition positions to V3.

This proposal intends to incrementally increase the reserve factors by 5% at each step. After implementing each increment, we'll assess user elasticity and the impact of the updates before moving forward with additional increases. We will ensure a minimum gap of 2 weeks between each subsequent update.

*Please note that a separate proposal will be made for frozen assets on V2.*

## Specification

| Asset | Current RF | Recommended RF |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DAI | 10% | 15% |
| FRAX | 20% | 25% |
| GUSD | 10% | 15% |
| LUSD | 10% | 15% |
| sUSD | 20% | 25% |
| TUSD | 20% | 25% |
| USDC | 10% | 15% |
| USDP | 10% | 15% |
| USDT | 10% | 15% |

| SNX | 35% | 40% |
| UNI | 20% | 25% |
| WBTC | 20% | 25% |
| ETH | 15% | 20% |

## Next Steps

1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.
2. If consensus is reached, submit the first Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.
3. Subsequent increments will be done directly through an AIP to reduce the governance overhead.

### **Author: ACI**

### **Date: 2024-08-14**

---

# **Summary**

This framework provides comprehensive guidelines for the Aave DAO community when creating and voting on TEMP CHECK, ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) and ARFC ADDENDUM proposals. It includes a template for crafting proposals and outlines the quorum and voting requirements.

## **Motivation**

### **Distinction Between TEMP CHECK, ARFC, and ARFC ADDENDUM**

TEMP CHECKs serve as “temperature checks” to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.

Conversely, ARFCs are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.

If minor updates are required for an ARFC, an ARFC ADDENDUM can be used instead of repeating the entire ARFC process. If this is not controversial and feedback from tokenholders and delegates is limited, the discussion period on forums can be reduced or bypassed for addendums.

### **Proposal Cycle**

 
![proposal cycle.png](ipfs://bafkreiar2b3qfrcbmpqdui3r66crdmqoipcaz4r3nqasba62aloz3dfzqa)
    

For ARFC addendums, the following process can be followed:

 
![arfc addendum.png](ipfs://bafkreibwic6oth347enxohkqxegqqjdd4kwtdjj5cvq7ak4mp3gncdhemu)
    

### **Proposal Structure**

Each proposal must include the following sections:

A header:

1. Title: A concise and descriptive title for the proposal, including the proposal type (ARFC, TEMP CHECK, or ARFC ADDENDUM) in a [TAG] format.
2. Author: The name of the author and/or entity creating the proposal.
3. Date: The date the proposal is being made, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

A proposal body:

1. Summary: A succinct summary of the proposal.
2. Motivation: A detailed presentation of the proposal and potential benefits for the Aave protocol. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
3. Specification: A comprehensive description of the proposed change, including any relevant parameters or risk considerations. For ARFCs, this section should be technical, detailing the specific changes to be made. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
4. Disclaimer: Any necessary disclaimers, such as conflicts of interest or third-party involvement.
5. Next Steps: The proposed next steps if the proposal is approved.
6. Copyright: A statement defining proposal copyright. While Open-Source is mandatory, the choice of a specific license is left to the author.

### **Voting Guidelines**

1. Vote Start Time: The vote should commence 24 hours after the proposal is published on Snapshot.
2. Proposal Age: The governance thread related to the snapshot vote should be at least 5 days old before voting begins.
3. Vote Duration: The vote should last for a minimum of 3 days.
4. Vote Options: The vote should have at least three options: YAE (Yes), NAY (No), and ABSTAIN. Sometimes a vote will require other voting options such as choosing between multiple options, however there should still be a NAY and ABSTAIN option as a minimum.
5. Quorum: The vote should reach a quorum of 320,000 YAE votes.
6. Differential: The YAE votes should exceed the second-largest vote option (either NAY or ABSTAIN) by at least 80,000.

### **Special Considerations**

This framework should be considered as a general template for proposals. Specific proposals and/or frameworks, such as asset onboarding or caps updates, should follow specific guidelines as determined by the Aave DAO community. Guidelines for many of the different frameworks are available in the [Aave Governance Process Document](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-governance-process-document-v1/18577).

This framework is designed to ensure that all proposals are thoroughly considered and that all votes are fair and representative of the Aave DAO community’s views.

## **Specification**

As this proposal pertains to governance guidelines, it does not require any on-chain action or protocol change.

## **Disclaimer**

The ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.

## **Next Steps**

1. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted.

The Aave protocol is a decentralized ecosystem of smart-contracts running on several EVM networks. This ecosystem is permisionless and anyone with the required tech knowledge can freely use 100% of the Aave protocol features.

That being said, for a more accessible user experience, the Aave companies created the Aave application 4 allowing the interaction with the Aave protocol without technical knowledge.

To reinforce the decentralization of the application, the Aave app is deployed on IFPS and considering Flux hosting to avoid centralization of hosting,

also, the Aave app, is fully open source 1 and allows any developer to contribute to the improvement of the application for the benefit of the end-users.

title: [ARFC] Extend Safety Module Coverage to Polygon v3
Author: @Llamaxyz and 3SE
Dated: 2023-02-14

---

# Summary

The proposal presents Aave the opportunity to extend the Safety Module coverage to include Polygon v3.

# Abstract

The Safety Module is a set of smart contracts allowing AAVE & aBPT (representing Balancer V1 ETH/AAVE LP) token holders to stake their tokens in exchange for a share of the distribution of Safety Incentives sourced from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.

Stakers in the safety module, lock their liquidity for a minimum of 10 days, and in the case of a shortfall event affecting the covered Aave markets, expose their stake assets to be mobilised to cover excess protocol debt up to 30% of their staked funds.

A Snapshot vote will determine if Aave extends the coverage of the Safety module to Aave Polygon v3. There is currently $154.80m of TVL deployed on Polygon v3.

# Motivation

Aave v3 is the most recent implementation of the Aave protocol, allowing new features, optimizations, and mitigation of risks.

Aave v3 has been battle tested for ~11 months in several networks, and its code was deemed safe enough to be allowed deployment on the Ethereum mainnet by the Aave governance.

The authors are supportive of extending coverage of Aave v3 by the safety module in order to offer the Polygon v3 users the same level of coverage as v2 users.

Soon, rewards are to be distributed across the v3 deployment encouraging v2 users to migrate. Extend the Safety Module to the v3 deployment further supports the migration of user’s capital to the v3 deployment. To help facilitate this, BGD has released a migration tool which can be accessed Aave the Aave front end.

# Specification

If a Short Fall event was to occur, similar to the CRV excess debt event during 2022, an ARC is required to determine how Aave is to respond. If Aave elects to proceed with auctioning funds held in the Safety Module, this will be implemented via an AIP.

This proposal is for Aave to agree in principle, via Snapshot, to set a precedent that the Polygon v3 deployment will be supported by the Safety Module if a short fall event were to occur.

A successful Snapshot vote which follows the AIP voting criteria will determine if the Safety Module is extended to cover the Polygon v3 market.

title: [TEMP CHECK] Allocating part of GHO Revenue to Safety Incentives
author: Marc Zeller, Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
date: 2023-06-07
---

## Abstract

This TEMP CHECK proposes the introduction of a dual reward system Safety Incentives, where a portion of GHO revenue is directed to the Aave Safety Incentives, enabling stakers (StkAAVE & StkBPT) to earn both AAVE and GHO tokens.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this TEMP CHECK is to enhance the sustainability of the Aave protocol by reducing its reliance on the Ecosystem Reserve of AAVE tokens for Safety Incentives. We propose a strategic shift towards harnessing protocol economic activity to generate ""real yield"" through the introduction of GHO as an additional Safety Incentive. 

By directing part of GHO revenue to the Safety Incentives, we aim to create a dual reward system, offering stakers both AAVE and GHO tokens. While the contribution of GHO to Safety Incentives may initially be a small fraction of the total incentives, it represents a significant step towards the protocol's maturity and sustainability. 

This proposal, suggests that the governance should adjust the distribution percentage quarterly, in response to market conditions.

As the Aave protocol already generates sustainable revenue that covers service provider costs, the introduction of GHO into the Safety Incentives mix is a viable and strategic move toward diversifying Safety Incentives and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the protocol.

### Potential Implementation

While technicals details of the implementation will be discussed at a potential ARFC stage of this proposal, and current stage is meant to gauge community's general interest, here's a diagram of a possible implementation, redirecting GHO revenue from Collector contract (dao treasury) to a splitter contract controlled by governance.

![image|2000x1028](upload://beyTiZ0BzFAVqdN2btMmu855a04.png)

### Initial Parameters

We propose to set a potential ""Gho Splitter"" contract with
- 80% toward COLLECTOR contract (Aave DAO treasury)
- 20% toward REWARDS_VAULT (controlling safety incentives)

## Next Steps

- If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage for service provider feedback and implementation discussions.

Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative

Date: 2023-04-04

## **Summary**:

This ARFC proposes the deployment of Aave V3 on the BNB Chain, expanding Aave's presence and tapping into the growing DeFi ecosystem and user base of BNB Chain.

## **Abstract**:

Upon approval by the Aave community, Aave V3 will be deployed on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT. This deployment aims to enhance the growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities, providing new opportunities for both ecosystems.

## **Motivation**:

Deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain presents potential benefits for both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and potential additional revenue. In return, BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.

## Title: [ARFC] OP Risk Parameters Update for Aave V3 Optimism Pool

## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative

## Date: 2023-08-25

---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes the activation of OP as a borrowable asset in the Aave V3 Optimism pool. The aim is to adapt to the maturity of the L2 and attract more suppliers and borrowers, thereby generating new revenue for the protocol.

## Motivation

The Aave OP V3 market is one of the Aave V3 L2 deployments, with OP being the native asset of the OP L2. At its inception, the L2 was in its early stages, leading to the onboarding of OP with conservative parameters due to nascent liquidity & infrastructure. 

As the L2 has matured, the ACI proposes less conservative parameters for the OP asset. By removing the isolation mode for OP and allowing its borrowing, we anticipate attracting more suppliers who can earn a yield on their OP deposits and new borrowers who can use OP to borrow additional assets. This will also generate new revenue for the protocol. 

While the proposed changes are less conservative, they still maintain strict supply, borrow caps, and a conservative interest rate strategy. This ensures that the DAO promotes growth and new opportunities while remaining risk-averse. Based on the collected market data post-implementation, the community will have the opportunity to revisit these parameters at a later stage.

## Specification

- **Asset**: OP
- **OP Contract Address**: [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042)

**New Risk Parameters**:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Asset | OP |
| Supply Cap | 10M |
| Borrow Cap | 500k |
| Loan To Value (LTV) | 30% |

This proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard 1INCH to the Etheruem Aave V3 Market.

# Motivation

As part of the community efforts on the V2 to V3 migration, Chaos Labs proposed a [multi-phased plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636) to promote V3 adoption. As per this plan, Chaos Labs proposes to list 1INCH on Aave V3 on Ethereum. 1INCH is currently listed on V2 Ethereum with borrow disabled.

As the proposed assets in the migration plan are traded with relatively low market cap and trading volume, we have taken a prudent approach in setting borrow caps to account for no more than 1% of the average daily trading volume. The supply cap was derived using our supply cap methodology with the V2 data (simulation results can be seen in the image below). Additionally, we have  adjusted the IR Slope1 to reflect the changes in interest rates over the past months and adjusted the liquidation bonus levels to the current liquidity levels in DEXs.

### Paragraph Summary

LUSD is stablecoin minted directly by the protocol users by opening a Trove and depositing ETH as collateral. Loans are interest-free, with a 0.5% base initiation fee. All the contracts of the Liquity protocol are immutable, which makes LUSD the most trustless stablecoin currently available on the Ethereum mainnet.

LUSD is overcollateralized by ETH with two main mechanisms helping it keep its peg: first, LUSD can be redeemed for ETH at face value (i.e., 1 LUSD for $1 of ETH). Secondly, there is a minimal collateral ratio of 110%. Both mechanisms respectively create a price floor and ceiling through arbitrage opportunities.

Since the protocol is immutable, no additional developments are planned, yet the Liquity team is working on another project that will prove synergetic with LUSD.

LUSD’s resilience makes it a highly sought-after stablecoin for DAOs and protocols looking to diversify their treasury and users looking for cost-effective leverage on ETH. The current focus is to grow the DeFi ecosystem around LUSD to enable more diverse use cases.

This proposal aims to add LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave v2 mainnet (0% LTV). If the current proposal is met with enthusiasm, other proposals will follow suit.

### Specifications

#### AIP author status

I, TokenBrice, author of this ARC [recently joined](https://tokenbrice.xyz/joining-liquity/) the Liquity team to help with DeFi strategy.

#### Overview of the project and token

Liquity is a protocol offering cost-efficient leverage using ETH as collateral. While its base design can be described as similar to Maker/DAI, there are several key differences:

* Only ETH is accepted as collateral to maximize the protocol's trustlessness and resilience.
* There is no interest fee on Liquity. Instead, the borrowers pay a predictable initiation fee starting at 0,5% — and ramping up algorithmically when needed to protect the protocol.
* Liquidations are close to instant, and enabled by a protocol-level backstop: [the stability pool](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations), a reserve of LUSD deposited by users.
* Just like Aave, Liquity uses ChainLink as the main price feed. However there is a [fallback system](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations) in place, switching to Tellor, if the ChainLink price feed data is deemed incoherent.
* Since the contracts are immutable, there is no governance. There is still a token associated with the protocol – [LQTY](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6dea81c8171d0ba574754ef6f8b412f2ed88c54d), but it’s used for incentivization and fee-sharing purposes only.
* The minimal required collateralization ratio is lower – at 110%, increasing the capital efficiency of the protocol. This is possible thanks to the stability pool and instant liquidation mechanism which also helps maintain the peg by acting as a liquidity buffer. A failsafe mechanism, called the Recovery Mode, is triggered when the total collateralization ratio of the protocol falls below 150%. Being an exceptional measure, the Recovery Mode enforces more substantial restrictions on the Troves, such as temporary minimal collateralization of 150%, until the total collateralization ratio of the protocol recovers. So far, it was only triggered once in the early days of the protocol.

#### Positioning within Aave Ecosystem

LUSD is a stablecoin offering some genuinely unique features, the leading one being the trustlessness of the whole Liquity protocol. In that sense, LUSD is one of the most resilient stablecoin and the most decentralized. Similar to the addition of RAI on Aave, having LUSD will help Aave diversify from the current dominance of centralized stablecoins such as USDC used for borrowing.

Furthermore, as mentioned above, this proposal is the first step. Several others could follow to nurture the relationship between Aave and Liquity further:

1. Enablement of LUSD as collateral (LTV>0%)
2. Enablement of efficiency mode against selected stablecoins once v3 mainnet is live.
3. Addition of LUSD on Aave/Optimism + potential enablement as collateral + again enablement of the efficiency mode.

I believe that LUSD as a borrowable asset will be met with a strong demand: it will be the first time such a resilient stablecoin could be borrowed on Aave and the first protocol where LUSD is borrowable.

#### History of the project and its components

The Liquity protocol was launched on the 5th of April, 2021. As the code is immutable, there has been no update since then. However, the team is still actively working on the protocol' DeFi integrations, such as supporting LUSD liquidity on Curve.

Since the demand for LUSD is directly dependent on the appetite for leverage on ETH, the LUSD supply had varied quite a bit since the launch, with the highest point around 1.5B LUSD when ETH reached a peak price of ~$4K. The following correction on ETH, with the lowest point around $2K, led to a drastic reduction in the LUSD supply – this episode is the first and so far unique time when the Recovery Mode was triggered. Since this episode, the supply has stabilized more and is now around 325M LUSD. This episode was the first massive stress test for the Liquity Protocol, which handled it gracefully – a recap is available here:

https://www.liquity.org/blog/how-liquity-handled-its-first-big-stress-test

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiezquc6y7pkordcigvzwfwhgjfagnilxeweeuawycupuq6gsb3jxa)
    


Since the protocol launch, various DeFi integrations have been built on top of the Liquity Protocol, here are some of the most notable:

* A Curve pool (+integration on Convex and Yearn) was created against the 3Pool and became the main liquidity source. It’s amongst the stablecoin pools with the highest base APR due to the trading volume it processes.
* DeFiSaver offers some automation features to streamline Troves management.
* B.Protocol delivered an auto-compounder for depositors of the Stability Pool who wish to keep a 100% LUSD exposure: https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity
* Some protocols, such as Olympus or Fei Protocol diversified part of their treasury to LUSD to shield themselves from volatility with an unstoppable stablecoin. Synthetix is also using LUSD on Optimism to stabilize the sUSD price.

#### LUSD usage

A sizeable share of the LUSD supply (~66%) is deposited into the Stability Pool, the liquidity backstop for liquidations: https://etherscan.io/address/0x66017d22b0f8556afdd19fc67041899eb65a21bb

The top LUSD holders also include other protocols, such as Olympus, DXdao or some treasuries.

LUSD is also present on Optimism, where Synthetix provided a wrapper contract to help stabilize the sUSD price (~45M LUSD) + to provide liquidity on Velodrome (the pool is ~9M TVL, against USDC).

#### LUSD Emission

The only way to mint LUSD is to open a Trove, while LUSD is burned through debt repayment, either directly (by the trove owner) or through redemptions (by an arbitrageur).

#### Token & Protocol Permissions

The LUSD token as well as the whole Liquity protocol are fully permissionless. There is no multisig and no governance, and no-one can interact with the contract underlying the protocol in an administrative manner: all users are the same in front of the contract, just like with Uniswap v2 for instance.

#### Market Data

As of June 03, the total LUSD supply is around 325M. There is about $90M of total liquidity in pools where LUSD is involved.

The main liquidity source for LUSD is the Curve pool with ~$65M TVL: https://curve.fi/lusd

There are also liquidity sources against FRAX, USDC and DAI on Uniswap V3: https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0

There is a 4-tokens pool on Saddle Finance (alUSD, FEI, FRAX, LUSD) with $25M liquidity: https://saddle.exchange/#/pools/D4/deposit

Finally, on Optimism, LUSD is the largest stablecoin pool with around ~$9M against USDC https://app.velodrome.finance/liquidity/0x207addb05c548f262219f6bfc6e11c02d0f7fdbe

The observed volume can vary depending on the market's activity (massive ETH price movements are usually followed by days with large volume), with a baseline around $3M daily volume (mainnet only).

#### Social channel data

The main channel for the community to gather is the Liquity Discord server, with around 6.5K members. For outward-facing communications, the main channel used is the @LiquityProtocol Twitter account with over 28.5K followers. We also regularly publish newsletter updates to subscribers (2.5K) and have recently become more active on LinkedIn (<1K).

#### Contract Related Information

Deployment of the LUSD contract - 05 April 2021: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x85cc9a6626ed080c909f768036c80bd02455c5dbd32a03aa1f16ba9575227599

The first minting of LUSD - 05 April 2021: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4db907b5377b14ad5849f7bd4fa2ecb52c1ce07757df8887cf4df3394d01842d

Number of transactions on LUSD: 197,461 (+ ~2000 on Optimism)

Number of token holders on LUSD: 4758 (+ ~100 on Optimism)

### Risk Assessment

We followed [Aave's risk assessment methodology](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/methodology) to provide all the necessary metrics:

I'm not sure what the proper rating is for a stablecoin with no governance and immutable code should be when it comes to the ""Permission"" category, so I went with an A to reflect that in that regard, LUSD is almost as safe as ETH. Feel free to challenge me if you think that is not appropriate.

## GHO Launch Support

TokenLogic coordinated the BAL and AURA incentives to support launching GHO on Balancer.

The table below provides a conservative estimate of the value of the voting support:

|Asset|Amount|Duration|Quest Price| Total|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|vlAURA| 400,000|12 weeks|$0.0085|$40,800|
|veBAL|165,000|12 weeks|$0.045|$89,100|

The Aura Finance team extended their support with 400,000 vlAURA for a duration of three months. In the initial weeks, dedicated members of the Balancer community contributed over 4% of the veBAL supply. The table provided above is based on an assumption that accounts for 2.5% of veBAL supply in July and considers the current veBAL Quest price. It's important to note that this data underestimates the actual value of the votes that TokenLogic procured and offers significant context for readers.

It's important to note that some voters may have opted to support GHO pools independently, without requiring active engagement from the Aave community.

# Terms

We request an additional $115k for the work detailed above, bringing the total compensation to $130k.

This figure was derived from wages and software licenses used to support hosting the GHO Analytics platform.

# Specification

If this proposal is approved, the amount is to be transferred to a TokenLogic-controlled account (`0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`) as the recipient.

The transfer will be equivalent to $115k USD in GHO.

# Next Steps

1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.

A proposal to adjust two (2) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Loan To Value, across one (1) Aave V2 asset. 


## Motivation

This set of recommendations follows [AIP 117](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=117) to further de-risk the REN market.

## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.

These parameter recommendations reflect the unique situation of REN in the current market conditions.  

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **REN Liquidation Threshold**     | 65%     | ***60%***     |
| **REN Loan To Value**     | 60%     | ***55%***     |



## Notable Accounts to Flag

As of 11/16/2022, the data shows that only one dust account, `0x0e1337ea2c604f9a937d2623af206cdd02167b38` would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This account has a total of ~$100 in supply.

This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on this forum post.



## Risk Dashboard

The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

Author: @fig - Flipside Crypto

Date: 2023-05-22

---

## Simple Summary

This Temperature Check seeks the community's input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Base mainnet, expanding Aave to a unique, OP-stack network.

## Background

Base is an open-source, developer-friendly L2 EVM blockchain, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. Base is incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase’s on-chain products and a sandbox for permissionless development.

Coinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launch of Base to help realize the Optimism superchain vision. Base testnet is currently live — and mainnet soon around the corner.

Docs are available at [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/)

Its mission and identity are stated clearly in the docs: ***Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users to web3.***

As a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective’s mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.

Four key principles have shaped Base that will continue to guide its approach:


**Open-source**

Base is built on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase is joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone.




**A bridge, not an island**

Base is optimized for easy, secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, as well as other L1 ecosystems like Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. Builders and users may start on Base, but go everywhere Base is a “bridge” for users into the crypto economy.



**Decentralization** 

 Decentralization is essential for the crypto economy ""to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone.” Coinbase is deeply committed to progressing toward full decentralization over the years ahead.


**For everyone**

Base is a vision to be an open ecosystem, seeded with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life.

 
Base has launched with a diverse array of launch partners, servicing different developer and user needs across data, block explorers, bridging, custody, DeFi, and others.

Please see the list below of robust launch partners:

 
![dd6a532ab00053c11ed6070d651915f493105e81_2_1380x712.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihs7se4xncwxlk4lrb3t4lkcsx2o2gkjqj6pt6rxplamuho5b2znm)
    

## Motivation

The Aave community has voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase across other prominent L2s such as Arbiturm, Metis, and Optimism.

By enabling Base on Aave, it creates valuable (and differentiated) revenue opportunities for Aave, capturing the growth and interest of users who live on the Coinbase platform.

Base is a way for Aave to instantly leverage Coinbase’s products and distribution: seamless Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to **110mm+** users and **$80B+** assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.

In the first week of Base, 18k developers deployed 55k smart contracts on testnet. This activity sustained through the network's announcement has the potential to introduce new, valuable users to DeFi and Aave.

Since Base's testnet launch on 02/23/2023, metrics illustrate strong activity:

* 2,000,000 accounts created
* 17,000,000 transactions
* 1,000,000+ addresses holding a Base Builder NFT for participating in in Quests

In addition, Base has shown impressive retention for a blockchain, with ~70,000 unique wallets returning to Base for subsequent transactions within one day. The users, likely early developers, paint a promising outlook for the activity that may be seen on mainnet.

## Specification

This *TEMP CHECK* presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Base mainnet on day one of its launch.

Suggested risk parameters for this asset are provided in the table below.

Flipside Crypto invites risk service providers (@Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of the token.

Base will deploy using the [Superchain token list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/tree/master/data), which an overview can be found [here](https://static.optimism.io/#adding-a-token-to-the-list). The community may decide to list more assets on this market depending on risk tolerance.

More information on the [Network Specifications](https://docs.base.org/network-information) may be found here.

## Disclaimer

The information provided above about Base is from public sources and Flipside Crypto cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.

For full disclosure, Coinbase partnered with Flipside Crypto upon the announcement of the network to make Base on-chain data available for free for analysts.

Coinbase has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and we are doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.

As a cautionary measure to prevent an appearance of a conflict of interest, Flipside will abstain from voting on this proposal - in line with other proposals we put forward.

This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.

## Next Steps

**Temperature Check:** Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Base Mainnet.

**ARFC:** If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.

**AIP:** If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market 

Author: [@mv_Trident]

Created: 2023-12-18

---

# Summary

This AIP proposes the onboarding of the PYUSD stablecoin, minted by Paxos Trust Company, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.

# Motivation

PYUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin minted through Paxos. While it’s still young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $230M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:

- Build synergies between Aave and PYUSD.
- Offer Aave users an additional stablecoin option.
- Strengthen the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin. (Trident may explore the deployment of a PYUSD/GHO pool)

We propose a PYUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.

If the community deems that PYUSD as collateral is immediately viable we stand ready to support that role on day one; otherwise following PYUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for PYUSD at a later stage.

# Specification

Ticker: PYUSD
Contract address: [0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8])https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8)

Chainlink Oracle: [https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/PYUSD-usd](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/pyusd-usd)

We propose the following parameters for a PYUSD onboarding:

Parameter	Value
Isolation Mode	No
Borrowable	Yes
Collateral Enabled	No
Supply Cap (PYUSD)	25M
Borrow Cap (PYUSD)	20M
Debt Ceiling	N/A
LTV	N/A

Liquidation Bonus	N/A
Liquidation Protocol Fee	10.00%
Variable Base	0.00%
Variable Slope1	7.00%
Variable Slope2	80.00%
Uoptimal	80.00%
Reserve Factor	10.00%
Stable Borrowing	Disabled
Stable Slope1	13.00%
Stable Slope2	300.00%
Base Stable Rate Offset	3.00%
Stable Rate Excess Offset	8.00%
Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio	20.00%
Flashloanable	No
Siloed Borrowing	No
Borrowed in Isolation	No

*Liquidity and Market Cap*

The PYUSD token was introduced a few months ago, and since its launch, its market cap has increased to approximately $230million. Over the coming weeks the pool will be scaled further with incentives in order to reach the necessary liquidity to support the proposed market parameters.

![PayPal USD Price Chart.png](ipfs://bafkreihqq36bcffddfsnmcz4m4gda4pcopqktjs4rdneanq4q4pggkesfm)
    
When analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at the available historical data. The 30 Day average Market Cap of PYUSD is $170M with a 30 day average volume of $4.7M. Over the last 7 days, the average Market cap has climbed to $209M with the same period seeing an average volume of $8.7M, the volume and aum increase is on the back of prior stakeholder efforts and we expect both to grow meaningfully in the coming weeks.

 
![coming weeks.png](ipfs://bafkreifqcajvizwsxvoiinqyppnncfzmdqk56dirdnwlfolhlwamonktva)
    

With peg holding well since inception, an average intra-day volatility of ~0.01%, and the ability of onboarded institutional investors to redeem PYUSD 1:1 with Paxos, we see low risk related to the stability of PYUSD’s price.

*Initial Supply and Borrow Caps*

PYUSD circulating supply is ~$230M. Given PYUSD is a new asset listing, we recommend adopting a conservative approach for setting supply and borrow caps for PYUSD, which gives room to expand caps should cap usage be elevated. We recommend a supply cap of 25M and a borrow cap of 20M.

*Variable Borrow Rate*

We recommend setting slope 1 to 7% due to current on-chain stable yield opportunities which we believe will remain viable for the foreseeable future.

*Borrowable in Isolation*

We do not see excess risk with enabling PYUSD being borrowable in isolation. If the community wishes to take a more conservative stance, it may wish to only limit PYUSD borrowing to non-isolated collateral.

# Next Steps:

1. Gather community feedback on this TEMP CHECK.
2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to TEMP CHECK snapshot stage.
3. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.
4. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.
5. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage

Title: [TEMP CHECK] Further Aave v1 deprecation strategy

Author: BGD Labs @bgdlabs

Date: 2024-01-09

---

## Summary
Approve further steps of Aave v1 off-boarding, to reduce operational overhead on deprecated Aave instances.


## Motivation
The Aave protocol v1 was released in January 2020 and eventually superseded by Aave protocol v2 in December on the same year.

While Aave v1 has been deprecated for a long time, some liquidity is still stuck on the protocol 1. Even if this instance is not covered by the Aave Safety Module, being part of Aave, it still is monitored and evaluated whenever development and/or security decisions are made.

This creates meaningful overhead for all involved development & security teams, which directly adds cost to the Aave DAO. Additionally, the architecture of Aave v1 is quite different to Aave v2 & v3, making it the most ad-hoc instance of Aave.

For the previous reasons, we think the community should evaluate approving extra off-boarding steps.


## Specification
To achieve a complete off-boarding of Aave v1, the following needs to be completed:

- All debt has to be settled, in order to allow liquidity providers on v1 to withdraw.
- All assets have to be withdrawn.

To minimise the impact on users we propose a phased approach, where each phase could last in the order of 1-3 weeks.

### Phase 1
In a first phase we recommend to upgrade the liquidation mechanism on the protocol in the following ways:

- It should no longer be possible to receive aTokens for liquidations (as the goal is to remove liquidity, not transfer it from user to user).
- It should be possible to liquidate healthy (collateralised) positions with a fixed liquidationBonus (e.g. 1%). This value should be small to not hurt borrowers, while still being big enough to incentivise liquidations. If this Temp Check is successful, we will confirm the number with risk providers., but 1% at the current moment would make the liquidation profitable for approximately 85% of the positions to liquidate.
- It should be possible to liquidate a entire position at once (currently on Aave v1 only 50% of a position can be liquidated).
- Interest rates should be lowered to the minimum, as the previously described always-enabled dynamics remove any need of utilisation dynamics.
- Remove flash loan fee, as there should not be extra incentives for liquidity providers.

### Phase 2
In a second phase we recommend increasing the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage.

The exact number must be chosen based on current market conditions to minimise user impact, but allow economical liquidations.

### Phase 3
Once the big majority of debt is repaid, we recommend to introduce a forced withdrawal mechanism. With forced withdrawals anybody could withdraw on behalf of any liquidity provider on Aave v1, with the funds received by the holder of the aToken.

It is important to clarify that further technical aspects on this should be analysed before executing this step, for example smart contracts receiving funds without triggering a withdrawal.

---

After all the Phases are finished, additional ad-hoc steps can be executed, like Rescue Mission for locked funds.


## Next Steps

If this TEMP CHECK is approved, we will proceed with an ARFC, with the final steps including feedback from risk service providers, and precise technical decisions.

Finally, AIPs will be created for the different phases.

title: [ARFC] Aave Robot v1
author: @bgdlabs - BGD Labs (Bored Ghosts Developing)
created: 2023-06-28
---

## Summary

Request approval from the community to move forward Aave Robot v1, the first iteration of a framework and architecture of smart contracts to automate permissionless actions of Aave, like those related to the Aave governance v2; powered by Chainlink Automation.

## How will it work?

A detailed description of the system can be found on the [Aave governance forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-robot-v1/13091), but as summary:
- Multiple `Robot` smart contracts will be deployed, that will contain the logic to 1) understand when a permissionless action on Governance v2 (or cross-chain governance) can be triggered (queueing, execution, cancel) and 2) execute them.
- A `AaveCLRobotOperator` will be deployed on each network, that will allow for the DAO to have ""admin"" control on all the underlying robots, in order to register new ones, cancel or funding them with the LINK required for execution.
- To simplify operational complexity, the maximum gas limit proposed will be close to the maximum allowed by the underlying Chainlink infrastructure. As anybody can top-up LINK on the Aave Robot via a permissionless function on the `AaveCLRobotOperator`, the community could request for external entities to partially or totally cover the execution costs of proposals by using it.
- As in some cases it could be desirable for example to disable automation of a specific proposal and this is not possible with ""slow"" governance procedures, a Robot Guardian role is defined that will be able to 1) disable automation for a certain governance proposal and 2) ""pause"" automation on a specific network.
Both actions are non-invasive, as it only affects the automation system, not the underlying governance system at all.
Initially, BGD will keep the Robot Guardian role.

### Setup flow

For the DAO to activate the system the procedure is simply the following:
1. A technical service provider (BGD in this case) will deploy both the Robot smart contracts and the `AaveCLRobotOperator`, on each supported network.
2. A governance proposal will be submitted to activate and configured those robots, and top them up with LINK from the Aave Collector.

Afterwards, the DAO can register new robots via governance proposal, or manage the registered ones however needed.",bullish,59.42,2023-06-28 15:05:08+00:00,67.23,67.23,2023-06-29 00:00:00+00:00,13.14372265230562,66.765,0.1236115785930662,0.9320601522922516,True," The text proposes a community approval for Aave Robot v1, an automation framework of smart contracts for Aave governance v2, powered by Chainlink Automation. It explains how multiple robot smart contracts will execute permissionless actions, with a DAO-controlled operator to manage them.

To activate the system, a technical service provider deploys the smart contracts on each network, followed by a governance proposal to activate and fund them with LINK from the Aave Collector.",bullish,medium

Title: [ARFC] Updated Aave Grants Continuation Proposal 
Author: @0xmigi & Bill
Created: 2023-11-14

---

# Summary

An opportunity to continue Aave Grants DAO (AGD) for 6 months by preserving the current AGD treasury holdings and increasing AGD’s GHO allowance by $328,000.

This proposal will enable AGD to deliver and improve upon the top tier grants program the Aave ecosystem has had over the past 2+ years and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem. AGD will fund $500,000 in developer grants per quarter, drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption, and set the groundwork for the next chapter of the continued evolution of AGD.

Figures and calculations based on asset prices have been updated from the TEMP CHECK to reflect the current market conditions.

# Motivation

Throughout the previous proposal, AGD has:

Awarded 50 new grants and made 15 payments to grantees based on milestone completion.

Engaged builders and the community at five events, including four hackathons where AGD awarded a total of 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties and inspired 58 teams to hack with Aave and GHO.

Proliferated the ghost by hosting 1 rAAVE to strengthen Aave’s culture, bring the community together, and cultivate an ecosystem with the best contributors.

Exercised prudence with the treasury by decreasing the average grant size awarded by 52.8% and maintaining average reviewer compensation at ~22% of the monthly maximum budget.

This proposal outlines renewing AGD for the next 6 months by:

Increasing AGD’s GHO allowance by $328,000.

*Since the Last Proposal*

The community has been kept up to date with AGD’s activity in @0xmigi’s monthly governance updates, the Halfway Update, and through AGD being added to Llama’s treasury dashboard 1. The AGD website houses a running list since inception of grants awarded, event and sponsorship spend and other information.

The GHO release was an exciting launch for the Aave community and was a prioritized focus throughout AGD’s last proposal. AGD began to spread awareness about GHO’s launch and encouraged early development with GHO across the four hackathons that were sponsored. AGD also funded multiple GHO related grants and supported development with the introduction of ‘Request for Grants’, inviting projects that help to stimulate GHO’s demand and increase its utility to apply for a grant.

*AGD Budget*

AGD has exercised prudence with the treasury, while continuing to fund high quality builders and drive growth and experimentation in the Aave ecosystem. The current AGD treasury, including token allowances and OP, is roughly $1,435,042. Please note: despite continuing to operate and distribute grants, the dollar value of the treasury has remained relatively flat since the TEMP CHECK due to the appreciation of AAVE and OP.

Part of the reduced spend is because of a reduction in the average size of grants awarded. The average grant size awarded so far in 2023 is 52.8% lower than the average grant size awarded during 2022, currently at $13,936.

*Other Initiatives*

- Increasing Grantee Accountability. There has been an influx in grantees (e.g. recently Defi Simulator, Projection Finance, and Aave Alarm) posting directly on the forum to introduce themselves, explain their grant, and to keep the community updated as they progress. Most of these posts are the result of an initiative from AGD to better increase grantee accountability and engagement with the community.

- ‘Requests for Grants’ (RFGs). A pilot project has been introduced to better direct builders to apply for grants in certain high impact areas. Going forward, AGD will look to expand the list of RFGs to target high impact areas and community needs by better communicating with different contributors and encouraging anyone to make suggestions.

- AGD Operations and Best Practices. Over the last two years of operations, AGD’s values and best practices have been refined and adopted. It is a priority for AGD to clearly define and share these values and best practices with the community. Here is an overview of AGD’s current process:

 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiefrkqq5lsl3na4sm7hhxnwaqozsxmhvt67edyvm6sdms3iz44pke)

*Grantee Highlights*

Since AGD’s last proposal to September 2023, 50 new grants have been awarded and 15 follow up milestone payments have been made. Of the 50 new grants awarded, 22 are complete, live or have reached notable milestones at the time of writing. Each grant has positively impacted different aspects of the Aave ecosystem.

 
![image](ipfs://bafybeic5lh6oay26aff4iuyetkhxlv6uxktk73qgcbhvbv6lhvzktvtjry)

Here are some recent highlights from grantees:

Dullahan

Designed and launched a hub for GHO to drive adoption. Dullahan produces passive income for stkAAVE holders and provides GHO borrowers with access to reduced interest rates and reached over 3,000 AAVE in deposits a few weeks after launch.

Sommelier Finance

Enables the creation of state-of-the-art DeFi strategies that leverage Aave V3 and GHO with the development and audit of a Aave V3 adaptor used by Sommelier strategies. As of July, their Aave V3 integration has allocated a net of $4M to Aave V3.

AAVE based CIAN Strategies & Automation Tools

Expands access to Aave V3 with open source vaults and advanced automation tooling, allowing strategists to generate strategies and users to easily access yield. As of August 2023, CIAN has generated $55M in TVL across Aave V2 and V3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, Ethereum Mainnet, Avalanche and Optimism via its leveraged staking strategies.

Other applications include: DeFi Simulator, Aave Alarm, Projection Finance and Karma HQ’s Delegate Dashboard.

IntoTheBlock Risk Radar for GHO 1

Helps the community understand GHO’s activity with 20 dedicated risk indicators including peg performance, collateral distribution and whale credit history.

Xenophon Labs

Performed an analysis on the Safety Module proposing an increase in the slashing percentage with the intent of saving the Aave protocol ~$2.1M per year

Butter

Facilitated an incentivized delegate initiative which kickstarted paying Aave delegates, encouraged participation in Aave governance from new community members and sparked TokenLogic to start their delegate platform.

Flexible aToken Voting ScopeLift

Unlocks the potential for new deposits by enabling protocols to allow users to retain voting power with tokens that are active in DeFi like Aave.

AwesomeQA

Streamlined the community support process with their Discord bot that automatically and quickly responds to user questions. In the past 3 months, the bot has answered over 55% of all questions, with 30% of those answers voted up by users indicating the response was very helpful.

*Operational Focuses for this Proposal*

The path to a decentralized and sustainable AGD is a long journey. Here are some initiatives planned for this proposal to continue working towards an effective and sustainable AGD:

Finish Establishing Legal Entity

Establishing a legal entity allows AGD to begin operating more independently and with more protection and certainty for contributors by providing a legal structure for members and the ability to operate with the traditional financial world. As it currently exists, AGD is not able to even sign a contract. Transitioning to an entity is a big step for AGD’s maturity by providing clarity and protection to contributors, along with increasing operational effectiveness.

AGD is currently finalizing the process of establishing a Cayman Foundation Company. The grants process will continue to operate as it does today and there will be no noticeable changes to AGD’s current processes or operations for the community.

Revamping Review Committee

AGD will update the processes and structure around the review committee. One idea AGD will explore is introducing a rotating committee of community experts to serve short (3-6 months) time frames as grant reviewers. This will further involve the community in AGD while bringing expertise from different community members.

AGD and Service Provider Alignment

With the increased number of Service Providers, there is a need to create better alignment between AGD and the work being done across the Aave DAO. Introducing simple activities like regular touch points would enable AGD to better (de)prioritize areas for grants based on feedback and insights from service providers. Where appropriate, AGD can also better work with service providers on helping to define the scope of related grants.

Measuring Impact

AGD aims to enhance the way it measures impact from grants by further developing internal resources and working with teams such as Spindl to better track the impact effectiveness of grants.

Starting with specific categories of grants like quests, AGD will better visualize activity driven by grants and gain insights into the effectiveness of different spend. Over time, AGD will extend similar tracking to other grant categories and impact metrics. This will enable the community to better track impact from grantees and empower AGD to make better review decisions.

*People*

AGD now has ten members.

Lead. Bill oversees the growth of the team, the distribution of grants, and making sure AGD meets the strategic needs of Aave DAO.

Review Committee. The Review Committee is made up of:

Corbin Page - Paymagic, ex-ConsenSys

Calvin Chu - Impossible Finance

Francis Gowen - Flipside Crypto

Lawrence Mosley - Omni Analytics

Kakashi - Symphony

Andrew Allen - Coinbase

David Truong - x23.ai, ex-Aave Companies Genesis team dev

Operations Lead. Neil has streamlined the application process, manages payments, KYC, and other administrative tasks.

Analyst. Migi is the main touch point with current and future grantees. He finds opportunities where AGD can support grantees and track the returns generated. Migi also provides monthly updates on the governance forum.

Compensation:

Lead: $9k/month

Review committee: $150/hr, capped at 10 hrs/week

Reviewer pay per month has averaged $1,273/month per reviewer since May 2021. We will look to modify this as part of the overall revamp of the review committee.
Analyst: $5k/month

Operations lead: $150/hr capped at 20 hrs/month

Designer and other roles: one-off based on specific design engagements

The roles and compensation will be reviewed and iterated on in line with the focuses outlined above.

*Proposed Budgets*

This proposal’s total budget will be split between a Grants Budget and an Operations Budget. In total across budgets the total ask for the next 6 months is:

$328,000 increase in AGD’s GHO allowance
This would make AGD’s treasury, including allowances: 72.2% in stables, 18.7% in AAVE, and 9% in OP

$292,000 that was previously allocated to ‘Digital Marketing’ spend has been reallocated to this budget.

Notably for the stablecoin portion of the treasury, AGD has started to explore further driving GHO adoption and grantee alignment by collaborating with @TokenLogic to swap AGD’s DAI allowance with GHO. AGD will look to continue to do this with other stablecoin holdings in the future based on similar style governance proposals.

*Grants Budget*

Carry Forward	Ask	Tokens for Ask
Developer Grants	$614,980	$300,000	Stables
$133,000	$0	OP
Grants Total Budgeted Cost	$747,980	$300,000	
The OP is based on the 100,000 OP allocated to AGD during the previous proposal.

AGD will introduce a new $20k max grant size for all grants and double down on kickstarting the growth of new teams building on top of Aave and GHO.

*Operations Budget*

Carry Forward	Ask	Tokens for Ask
Compensation	$20,150	$300,000	Stables
Maintenance: Tooling, subscriptions, gas reimbursements	$526	$20,000	Stables
Legal Buffer	$69,984	$0	
Operations Total Budgeted Cost	$90,660	$320,000	
Increasing the overall amount allocated to operations, especially compensation, is necessary for AGD to grow its resources and operate more independently.

A proposal to increase stablecoin Interest Rate parameters across all Aave deployments.

## Motivation

Following the implementation of [AIP-375](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/375/) to increase stablecoin borrow rates across Aave V2 and V3 deployments, we continue to observe volatility in borrow rates across Aave deployments. As we [highlighted](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096/3) in the recent proposal, we recommend a more aggressive increase of the Slope1 parameter to stabilize borrows under the UOptimal point.

### Previous IR Curve modification impact analysis

**Stablecoins Total Supply and Borrow:** The data from the charts reflects an overall increase in both the supply and borrowing of stablecoins on the Ethereum V3 platform. From November 25th to December 12th we observed the following increases in supply and borrow across USDC, USDT, and DAI:
 
![image](ipfs://Qma9SeLwfVs7v6gFVLdQsGR8pHWVkiK8xnNjncMLFmmKEe)
    
We’ve observed an overall $49M increase (20.8%) in supply across USDC, USDT and DAI on Ethereum V3, and a $104M increase (45.4%) in borrows.
This general uptrend suggests that the AIP's changes were well received, with higher utilization for the assets following the parameter updates.

![Frame 78017.png](ipfs://QmZrFJXLiYdXkHazHzhQU9ztciMZhbmZW91fosSsPbS2k3)

 
![Frame 78018.png](ipfs://QmapwiVXKY9F8LAToEgAJMLTJUTD8qaHjM4jvHCtyCPfAF)
    

**Utilization Rate Analysis:** Our continuous monitoring of the utilization rates post AIP-375, setting Slope1 at 5%, shows sustained demand. When looking at the percentage of times in which utilization was above UOptimal, we can see that the AIP-375 increase didn’t stabilize the utilization at or below the UOptimal. This could also be due to changing market dynamics with the recent increase in crypto asset prices.

During two distinct 16-day intervals, we observed the following:

- **Pre-AIP-375 Period (11.09.23 - 11.25.23)**
- **Post-AIP-375 Period (11.25.23 - 12.12.23)**

**Percentage of Time of Utilization Above UOptimal:**

| Asset | Before AIP-375 | After AIP-375 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USDC | 69.53% | 77.34% |
| USDT | 63.02% | 33.09% |
| DAI | 48.70% | 63.24% |

 
![Frame 78019 (1).png](ipfs://QmeVmhQjvUfCyx8X1Dioriz5rmcMQNVP4xRr1bcGomF3Ye)
    
The data demonstrates strong borrowing activity persisting after the interest rate curve adjustments, supporting a move towards higher interest rates. This pattern reflects a consistent, resilient demand among the top stablecoins on Ethereum V3.

**Borrow Rate Analysis:** After executing the previous proposal, we continue to observe fluctuations in borrow rates, suggesting the previous increase did not achieve the anticipated stabilization. This situation suggests that further adjustments of the interest rate parameters are necessary to achieve more consistent and stable borrowing rates.

### Recommendation

**Adjust Slope1 of stablecoins to 6%**

The analysis indicates a necessity for further refinement of stablecoin interest rates, to achieve a more predictable and stable borrowing rate with an equilibrium utilization under the UOptimal point. 
Therefore, we propose increasing Slope1 to 6% for stablecoins across all Aave deployments, in this iteration. Following this increase, we will continue monitoring the usage and equilibrium rate and make additional recommendations as necessary.

title: [TEMP CHECK] Integrating MakerDAO's DSR into Aave V3 Ethereum Pool
author: @MarcZeller Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)
created: 2023-05-31
---

## Abstract

This TEMP CHECK proposes integrating MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate (DSR) into Aave V3 ETH pool. This would be achieved by integrating sDAI, an ERC-4626 Vault token that includes the DSR yield, into the Aave protocol.

## Motivation

The DSR is a variable rate set by MakerDAO governance that allows DAI holders to earn savings by locking their DAI into the DSR contract. Recently, MakerDAO governance plans to increase the DSR rate to 3.49%. By integrating the DSR into Aave via sDAI, we can allow Aave liquidity providers to benefit from the DSR rate without additional cost to the Aave DAI borrowers.

## Specification

At the protocol level, when a user deposits DAI, the protocol will wrap their DAI in the form of sDAI and deliver aDAI to the user. When a user borrows DAI, the protocol will unwrap the stored sDAI, deliver DAI, and accrue the debt amount in DAI.

![image|1920x1563, 40%](upload://fQNJl46MrGPtwEuH6Trg6zzyqNP.jpeg)

## Limitations

This integration will have the consequence of increasing the gas cost of using DAI in Aave for every user. The exact impact of these gas cost increases should be reviewed and considered by the community during the ARFC stage of this proposal.

## Next Steps

If this TEMP CHECK receives positive feedback and a Snapshot vote outcome is YAE, the next step would be to draft an ARFC
detailing the technical implementation of this integration.

shortDescription: Pre-approval for the Aave Governance v3 system, and its dependencies: a.DI and Robot v3
author: @bgdlabs
created: 2023-07-10
---

## Summary
This vote asks for approval from the community on 3 interdependent projects developed together within the Aave <> BGD Labs scope: Aave Governance v3, a.DI (Aave Delivery Infrastructure) and Aave Robot v3.

## Context
One of the main developments included into the Aave <> BGD Labs engagement was the next iteration of the governance system of Aave: v3.

In order to enable it, being heavy on cross-chain communication, we have also developed a.DI, a cross-chain communication abstraction layer of smart contracts.
Additionally, an instance of the already approved Aave Robot will be deployed for Governance v3, as layer of permissionless automation.
All of them, and specially Aave Governance and a.DI are inter-dependant.

Extensive information about the 3 components can be found on the following links, including architecture, flows, voting assets or initial underlying bridge providers, amongst others:

- [Aave Robot](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-robot-v1/13091)

## The proposal
Even within the Aave <> BGD Labs engagement context, this vote tries to follow good procedures on the community and ask for pre-approval on all the ideas exposed on the previously linked posts, for them to be official.

The voting options are:

**FOR** - support the Aave Governance v3 and its dependencies

**AGAINST** - don't support Aave Governance v3 and its dependencies

Proposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.

Proposal: About Metis
Born out of the need for permissionless and open collaboration, Metis Andromeda is an EVM Equivalent Ethereum Layer 2. MetisDAO Foundation is building a hub for the Web3 economy in 3 stages: an Ethereum Layer 2 providing top-notch scalability; built-in on-chain credentials through Nuvo, providing countless capabilities previously just available for Web2 and traditional finance; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework facilitating the transition of Web2 onto Web3, and enabling Web3 and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain. All the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.

Andromeda network utilizes an upgraded Optimistic Rollup architecture, allowing for high throughput while maintaining Ethereum’s underlying security. Currently, Metis is a Stage 0 Rollup, according to Vitalik’s proposed categorization framework. Metis Andromeda is a first-of-its-kind Smart L2. The concept of the Smart L2 explores the design space in between Rollups and Plasma architectures, combining rollup’s security with plasma’s scalability. Learn more about the Metis Smart L2. Our L2 is not where our vision ends, per se; our L2 is a means to the end of building an open collaboration framework to host the Web3 economy. This is the foundational base layer that will allow further developments and rollout of the next business verticals.

Our second vertical is Nuvo, a Web3 identity system providing infrastructure to mint and use non-transferable NFTs and toolkits for on-chain credentials: portable and composable credentials earned through on-chain achievements and history. Soulbound tokens will allow and enable no-coin governance, establishing provenance, decentralized key management, souldrops, and countless Web2 functionalities that weren’t previously available for Web3. Nuvo also offers a state-of-the-art cross-chain wallet, enabling account abstraction and several benefits for users. These features will help the ecosystem realize and embody its goals of decentralization, secure its long-term health, and make it the perfect setting for Web2 organizations looking to transition into Web3 without facing a substantial UI change.

Third, Koris: tooling and infrastructure for DAOs, and soon, seamless onboarding of Web2 to Web3 through our Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework. Koris provides tooling and infrastructure for DAOs to perform their day-to-day operations in a more efficient manner and will allow Web2 organizations to create and tailor DACs to their preference.

When combining all these components, Metis Andromeda will create a framework for open, decentralized, and trustless collaboration between individuals, dApps, and Web2 organizations transitioning to Web3. All the functionalities enabled by on-chain credentials, the scalability provided by the base Layer 2, and the tooling provided by Koris’ operational system. The perfect suite for dApps, Web2 platforms, or any builder.

MetisDAO Foundation announced earlier this month its upcoming transition to a Hybrid Rollup, either late 2023, or early 2024. This architecture will combine the EVM Compatibility and fast transaction confirmation of Optimistic Rollups, with the censorship-resistance, security, and fast transaction finality enabled by zero-knowledge proofs. Logically, this will be a huge step to secure the Decentralized Finance applications of the network, and provide a very robust base layer for the Web3 Economy.

Committed to supporting our ecosystem builders and seeing them succeed, MetisDAO Foundation can fund projects in 3 main ways:
Builder Mining Rewards
Ecosystem Grants 
Genesi DAC Investments
*The Builder Mining Reward (BMR) program distributes 4000 METIS tokens each month based on how many txs out of the monthly total each protocol is responsible for (eg. if a protocol is responsible for 10% of the network txs, the protocol would receive 400 METIS that month as part of our sustainability grants / retroactive funding practices).

As we build the path towards a Web3 economy, it is crucial to establish strong and long-lasting decentralized finance foundations. A trusted and established money market such as Aave is a key foundational piece to building up strong capital markets in support of the Web3 economy we are building towards. Through this integration, Aave can also obtain additional revenue through protocol fees as well as through the Metis Builder Mining Program. 

Metis envisions and builds towards a rollup-centric future on Ethereum, and seeks to invite Aave to be part of this mission and enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a strong DeFi ecosystem, and there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, but having a Flagship protocol like Aave has always been our end goal in the realm of money markets. The deployment would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while also complementing Aave’s multichain expansion. 
Technical Evaluation by BGD
In the spirit of security and transparency, Metis worked alongside BGD (Bored Ghosts Developing) to perform a technical evaluation on the Andromeda network. The evaluation consisted of 13 categories, with 4 different possible scores: Optimal, Good, Acceptable, and Needs Improvement. Each of the categories scored as follows:

Oracle Infrastructure: Optimal
Blockchain Explorer: Good
Compatibility with Ethereum RPC standard: Optimal
Compatibility with Ethereum account format (addresses): Optimal
RPC public endpoints and providers: Acceptable
Custom behavior (lack of) the execution layer: Optimal
Support of wallet providers: Good
On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Good
Transactions simulation infrastructure (fork): Good
Chain data/indexing solutions: Acceptable
Bridging infrastructure: asset, messages: Optimal
Commitment in security-incidents: Optimal
Network security/technical model: Good

*RPC public endpoints and providers: We integrated Bware services in order to increase the variety of RPC alternatives in the network. We are also in talks with other top tier providers to further bolster our RPC infrastructure. We were in communication with BGD throughout this process to ensure the providers we chose met their technical standards.
*Chain data/indexing solutions: We’re currently finalizing talks with a top data indexing platform in order to enable the right tooling and services in the ecosystem.

Risk Parameter Setting and Asset Listing with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet
Gauntlet and Chaos Labs collaborated to provide a risk analysis and recommendations for the deployment of the Metis Andromeda network. We will follow the recommendations of these trusted risk parties for Aave, for setting both the risk parameters as well as the assets to be listed. 

https://governance.aave.com/t/launch-aave-v3-on-metis/7056/61?u=metis


Incentivized Adoption

We are excited to propose a 100,000 Metis token liquidity incentivization campaign throughout a six month period shortly following deployment. We will be working with Chaos Labs to map out the most strategic allocation of these incentives to bolster strong market depth and sticky liquidity, ensuring to follow best industry practices and monitoring the efficacy in real time.


Next Steps

Assuming a passed deployment vote, we will coordinate with BGD to begin the Aave deployment process and implementation. We expect this process to take roughly four weeks. After the subsequent launch of Aave V3 on Metis, we will monitor the activity and launch the aforementioned liquidity mining incentive program. We will continue to stay in close communication with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet to keep a watchful eye on liquidity levels and inflows, to ensure proposed increases in market caps, congruent with increased liquidity depth on-chain. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with and provide value to both the Aave DAO and community at large, as well as the entire Metis ecosystem.",bullish,74.8,2023-03-16 14:27:06+00:00,80.6,80.6,2023-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,7.75401069518716,79.19999999999999,0.0588235294117645,0.8195208311080933,True," The text presents a proposal for deploying Aave V3 on the Metis Andromeda Mainnet, a scalable Ethereum Layer 2 network.

Title: [ARFC] Aave DAO Policy Change: Halt Listings on all Aave v1 & v2 Non Permissioned Deployments
Author: @Llamaxyz, Gauntlet, Chaos Labs, 3SE Holdings & @ItsFreeRealEstate
Status: Proposed
Dated: 2022.11.26

---

# Simple Summary

As part of the *Sunsetting of v1*, the *v2 -> v3 Migration* & the *Deprecation of v2* discussions being conducted by the community [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-discussion-v2-v3-migration-v2-deprecation/10676) and [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategy-on-sunsetting-of-aave-v1/9450), the authors are appealing to the Aave DAO to adopt a policy of halting listings on the following markets:

- Aave v1 \(Ethereum & Uniswap Markets\)
- Aave v2 \(Ethereum, AMM, Polygon & Avalanche Markets\)



# Abstract

With the release of Aave v3 featuring superior risk management parameters and controls, this proposal advocates only enabling future asset listings to occur on Aave v3 deployments. Upon implementation of this upgrade, via a successful Snapshot vote, assets can no longer be add/introduced to the Aave v2 deployments.  

**Note: The Aave ARC & Centrifuge RWA markets, which are powered by the ""Permissioned"" V2 codebase are not included. These liquidity pools support the latest battletested version of the ""Permissioned"" code base.**


# Motivation

This proposal seeks to begin the transition from v2 to v3 deployments. The first step in this progression is to focus our efforts on growing the v3 deployments whilst continuing to actively support the v2 deployments in all other areas. Going forward all future asset listings are to be limited to only v3 deployments.

Successful passing of this ARFC will indicate the DAO has decided that the various V3 deployments are the future of the Aave DAO, and support of the various listed markets will be limited to Risk and Critical Technical Updates. 

# Specification

The Aave Community upon successfully voting on Snapshot to implement this upgrade, will prevent any further assets from being added to any of the following Aave Market pools, as identified by their LendingPool Addresses.

- Ethereum V1 Market [0x398eC7346DcD622eDc5ae82352F02bE94C62d119](https://etherscan.io/address/0x398eC7346DcD622eDc5ae82352F02bE94C62d119)

### **Author: Renzo Protocol & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)**

### **Date: 2024-08-02**

---

> ARFC has been updated with Risk Parameters provided by Risk Service Providers 2024-08-12.

## **Summary**

This is an ARFC to continue to gauge community sentiment for adding borrow/lend support for Renzo Protocol and its Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) ezETH on AAVE V3 Ethereum, after the successful [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-ezeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/17151).

To align best with goals of all relevant stakeholders, this proposal suggests onboarding ezETH to Lido’s Aave v3 instance.

## **Motivation**

As productive assets, staking tokens are high quality collateral to borrow against. ezETH is one of the largest liquid restaking tokens. With withdraw feature now enabled and the peg holding steady over the near term, we believe it is time to consider adding ezETH as a collateral asset. 

The onboarding of ezETH will consequently create increased ezETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and Renzo Protocol, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of ezETH.

Adding ezETH to the Lido Aave v3 instance brings additional synergies for all stakeholders. 

ezETH will add additional demand for wstETH borrowing, making the wstETH looping more favorable for the main users. Incentives from Renzo can bring additional ETH liquidity to the Lido instance, bolstering the existing liquidity mining campaigns. 

## **Chain to be deployed/listed**

Aave v3 Lido instance on Ethereum

### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**

Renzo will be providing 3X points multiplier for ezETH deposits, which will be the highest points multiplier available for comparable protocols. 

## Specification

ezETH: [0xbf5495Efe5DB9ce00f80364C8B423567e58d2110](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbf5495Efe5DB9ce00f80364C8B423567e58d2110)

### [TEMP CHECK] AAVEnomics update
### Author: ACI
###  Date: 2024-07-25
---
### Simple Summary:

This proposal seeks governance feedback and consensus on leveraging the Safety Module Umbrella update to create a clear path and roadmap related to the protocol ""fee switch"", defined as updated ""AAVEnomics"".

## Motivation

### Before we start

This proposal leverages the https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-umbrella/18366 proposal, it is strongly advised to read it before diving into the current proposal.
The current proposal has been peer-reviewed by Aave service providers and active Aave DAO community representatives & delegates.

### Introduction

The Aave protocol is the clear market leader in the liquidity vertical and is focused on expanding in both the stablecoin and bridging verticals. The protocol's TVL and net profit growth have largely outpaced market conditions thanks to the coordinated efforts of service providers appointed by DAO governance.
The Aave protocol is also the clear leader on every network Aave has deployed to, and when given a choice, DeFi users leverage Aave over alternatives.
This has allowed the Aave DAO not only to ""cover its own bills"" but also has built [a large treasury of ETH and stablecoins](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/treasury).

 
![treasury.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihrskqratcejxrmldlzopv4lj42esks3cgel2kugnd3ijzlt4leui)
    

Additionally, during the past couple of quarters, the DAO explored revenue sharing with the Merit program, which is essentially a redistribution of the protocol's net stablecoin excess revenue to the GHO minters and stakers to support aligned behaviors and the growth of GHO. Alongside Merit, the Ahab program, which is funded by protocol net ETH & ETH-correlated assets, is mobilized to attract strategic liquidity in Aave markets, supporting protocol growth in the main & new markets.

With the ACI, we consider the DAO now ready to explore a further step in the protocol's maturity and would like to submit for governance consideration a clear path for protocol net excess revenue redistribution to the key actors of the Aave ecosystem, creating new positive dynamics and novel synergies within the industry.

This journey is designed in several incremental steps. This proposal seeks feedback on the journey as a whole as a “TEMP CHECK” and approval to begin the first step via a potential “ARFC”.

To ensure the DAO's long-term sustainability, new steps will be escalated when the protocol reaches specific growth and net excess revenue milestones.

## Umbrella: A Proposed Safety Module Paradigm Shift

The Safety Module is a crucial line of defense for the Aave protocol. In case of a shortfall event, and if liquidators do not complete their tasks, the Safety Module is designed to assume the excess debt on behalf of users to avoid or at least mitigate bad debt events.

Fortunately, the Safety Module has never been needed for the Aave protocol. The few excess debt events in Aave protocol history have been addressed by governance through the mobilization of ""cash"" DAO treasury funds.

However, the current model is inefficient as it relies on secondary liquidity to liquidate Safety Module assets to obtain excess debt assets and clear debt.

With both GHO and StkAAVE, the primary issue with the Safety Module is that the current $424M hosted in the Safety Module cannot effectively clear $424M of excess debt. This is because:

1. The value of AAVE would be negatively impacted due to slippage.
2. The GHO peg is unlikely to withstand the mobilization of almost two-thirds of its current supply.

While it is highly improbable to encounter an excess debt event of this magnitude (precedent was less than 1% of this amount), the entire model has room for optimization.

Therefore, Umbrella proposes:

1. Segregation of coverage
2. Elimination of reliance on secondary liquidity

From now on, the Safety Module activation should focus on slippage-free debt burn coverage.

Umbrella allows the deployment of aTokens Safety Modules that are more cost efficient and provides better protection to Aave users; This proposal seeks approval on a multi-step journey toward Umbrella Activation and redefines the Role & benefits of the AAVE assets & tokenomics in the Aave ecosystem.

## Umbrella Coverage Adoption Journey

As an initial and immediate step:

We propose segregating StkGHO and StkAAVE Safety Module coverages to distinguish protections and improve StkGHO Safety Module efficiency, which would protect the GHO stablecoin.

With this upgrade, the StkGHO Safety Module is meant to only protect users from GHO debt and is mobilized to clear GHO excess debt only.

GHO is a young stablecoin with limited secondary liquidity. In the current stage of GHO maturity, mobilizing GHO to protect other assets' debt will mean the death of the GHO peg and trust in GHO for limited resources gained.

However, in the context of GHO debt protection only, StkGHO is a perfect tool. In case of a shortfall event, GHO can be seized in the Safety Module and used to clear excess debt by burning GHO. This action is absolutely slippage-free and will not impact the GHO peg.

Safety Module users will suffer a below 1 StkGHO <> GHO exchange rate, but it's a risk they willingly accepted by staking.

Example: If there's 100M GHO in the Safety Module and the protocol suffers a $3M excess debt GHO shortfall event, via an AIP, 3M GHO will be seized from the Safety Module to clear the debt. As a result, the StkGHO/GHO exchange rate will drop to 0.97, leading to a socialized net haircut of 3% for all Safety Module stakers (around 6 weeks of the current reward rate).

This paradigm shift will make GHO the safest and most trustworthy stablecoin in the ecosystem with currently both an average overcollateralization ratio of 2.5 and ~65% of the supply that can be mobilized to clear any form of excess debt without impacting the GHO peg.

This will de facto make Ethereum StkGHO the first Safety Module adopting the Umbrella standard.

These changes come at the cost of temporarily reduced overall V3 protection, but as discussed earlier, GHO is not mature enough to be a suitable asset to protect other debts than GHO at this moment. The reduced protection will be covered by the introduction of new Safety Modules in further steps.

We propose adopting the following:

### Umbrella coverage adoption Journey doctrine:

1. The Legacy Safety Module coverage is set to all live networks Aave V3 debt until replaced.
2. The Legacy StkGHO SM protects GHO debt exclusively. This safety module becomes the prime candidate for becoming the first Umbrella safety module instance via upgrade.
3. The Umbrella Ethereum Safety Modules will not automatically cover Aave V3 deployments; coverage must be opt-in by governance vote.
4. Mid-term: segregate risk further by deploying network-specific Umbrella Safety Modules financed by protocol ""local"" net excess revenue.


### StkGHO Migration and upgrade Journey

GHO is growing and is meant to be a profitable product of the Aave protocol. At ~150/175M GHO, GHO is expected to be net profitable for the protocol, with revenue outpacing system subsidies.

Currently, GHO has a dual reward system with rewards in AAVE sourced from the ecosystem reserve and Merit airdrops sourced from protocol net profits.

We propose, in resonance with previous governance decisions, to slowly cut rewards of the StkGHO safety module in favor of a potential Umbrella StkGHO safety module.

The Merit programs yielded great results in terms of growth, peg preservation, and user behavior optimization. We propose to maintain the Merit program in its current form.

This will keep a dual reward system for StkGHO: a ""base yield"" paid continuously in GHO to stakers and an ""Airdrop"" yield via Merit that can be optimized to reward more users with net positive behavior for the protocol, maintaining ""boosts"" of most wanted behavior but ensuring a sustainable ""base yield"" for this part of the Safety Module. Both of these rewards are financed by Aave protocol net revenue.

In practical terms, The Legacy GHO safety module has whitelisted AAVE emissions until Oct 2024 and benefit from Merit, we propose to slowly incentivize user migration to the Umbrella stkGHO by letting the AAVE distribution slowly expire and changing the Merit reward focus on Umbrella on the next Merit round post-publication.

This will slightly increase cost and efficiency by having a few weeks off incentives on both StkGHO safety module but gains on users experience allowing them to migrate at their own pace justifies it.

## A new role for Aave beyond the Legacy Safety module, AAVENomics update.

AAVE is the center of gravity of the Aave protocol. It is the governance asset of the DAO, allowing true control and ownership of the Aave protocol to a degree not achieved in any other protocol in our industry. But as a Safety Module asset, it's simply not efficient enough. AAVE is not a debt token in the Aave protocol and is not as liquid as ETH and major stablecoins.

### End the ""Seize and Sell"" Doctrine

The ""seize and sell"" doctrine is dangerous as it's inefficient due to slippage, creates the need to subsidize strong secondary liquidity (StkBPT Safety Module), and causes great price pressure on the asset in case of mobilizing the Safety Module. This reduces the cost of acquiring a large amount of AAVE and taking effective control and ownership of the protocol. With historically 15-30% of the Aave supply in the Safety Module and considering the average governance participation, this risk must be seriously considered.

Additionally, the relatively low maximum slashing of 30% of the AAVE Safety Module means the protocol is allocating funds that are mostly not even mobilizable to protect the protocol.

Lastly, the AAVE Safety Module is not sustainable as it is subsidized by the ecosystem reserve that will eventually run out of funds.

We propose the AAVE Safety Module to not be included in the Umbrella update, StkAAVE will evolve into a staking role acting as a liquidity sink and a way to collect rewards generated from the protocol revenue and other protocol benefits.

### StkBPT Redefinition

The Aave DAO has spent large amounts of resources incentivizing AAVE's secondary liquidity to maintain the current Safety Module paradigm.

While the secondary liquidity of AAVE is important, it should not be a focus of the Safety Module.

The DAO earned experience with secondary liquidity management with the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) program, yielding great results on GHO peg and growth.

We propose not including StkBPT from the Umbrella Safety Modules and appoint the ALC to manage AAVE secondary liquidity. We also propose the introduction of a ""Buy & Distribute"" program funded by the protocol's excess revenue, With a budget defined by Aave Finance service providers and management by the ALC.

The ALC and Aave Finance service providers will continue their journey of decentralization and automatization of these processes, contributing to a future with the human element as removed as possible from these actions.

This will increase the Safety Module's budget efficiency, make the subsidy of secondary liquidity sustainable, and allow more granular liquidity management. It is expected to optimize the funds needed to maintain the expected outcome.

In this new system, Liquidity will still be incentivized, but we expect a large optimization in the cost and management of this secondary liquidity.

### Introduction of Anti-GHO

Creating a GHO borrow rate discount was a good idea to align AAVE holders and GHO minters, but the discount mechanism is not efficient in terms of protocol accounting and can be optimized.

We propose, based on discussions with several service providers, particularly Bgd Labs, the removal of the GHO borrow rate discount and the introduction of a new “anti-GHO” token generated by StkAAVE holders minting GHO.

The users linearly accumulate anti-GHO, which is claimable at the user's will. Anti-GHO generation is proportionate to the interest accumulated by all GHO borrowers.

Anti-GHO is a non-transferable ERC-20 linked to a couple of special-purpose GHO facilitators that can be used in two ways:

1. Burn Anti-gho to mint GHO used to repay their own GHO debt ""for free.""
 
![burn anti gho mint.png](ipfs://bafkreifvldjg2ivjc3x7li4hmv4v4bde5xii6p6vwnlm6cdh62zgtlwv5m)
    

2. Mint GHO to be deposited on the user’s behalf in the GHO Safety Module and distribute StkGHO to the user.

 
![holders stkaave.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreibylsxdbvqvwllrvmkd3x6b7e6dqcvuo6tnbevzz5g7jppb2hjp7a)
    


Both special-purpose facilitators' ""debt"" will be regularly ""cleared"" by mobilizing GHO from the Aave Collector via Aave treasury regular AIPs to repay, ensuring no long-term unbacked GHO in the protocol.

This new system is more efficient, increases the alignment of AAVE stakers with GHO borrowers, and officially introduces revenue sharing of part of the Aave protocol revenue to some AAVE stakers, acting as the initial step of a more ambitious excess revenue-sharing strategy.

### Closing the LEND chapter

Nearly 4 Years ago, After the launch of Aave V1, the Aave protocol proposed the initial AAVEnomics migrating the legacy asset LEND into the current AAVE token.
After a significant amount of time passed and witnessing the lack of activity of the legacy asset, we take this proposal as an opportunity to close the LEND chapter.

We consider that 4 years and the amount of time that will pass for these proposals, publications, approvals, implementations, and execution to offer ample and fair notice to legacy users to migrate to AAVE, we propose to deactivate the legacy migrator contract and transfer the remaining balance to the Ecosystem reserve to be mobilized for Aave Stakers and protocol growth.

## Activate Umbrella Atokens Safety Module, initiate “Buy and Distribute” AAVENomics

The Aave protocol is seen as the industry standard in terms of resilience and safety, making Safety Modules of Aave a popular option for protecting protocol users despite the risks.

Additionally, ~80% of the Aave protocol users deposit in the protocol but do not have Aave debt. Their use case of the protocol is to seek yield on liquidity provided. These users consider the Aave protocol safe enough to keep their assets inside the protocol contracts for the long term.

The paradigm shift to ""seize and burn"" instead of the current ""seize and sell"" increases the Safety Module efficiency significantly. The natural progression of this strategy is to mobilize users who consider the Aave protocol safe enough to hold their assets and do not seek to create debt to consider renouncing their Safety Module protection, their borrowing power and short-term aToken liquidity (cooldown period) in exchange for extra yield.

This is done by adding a Atoken category to the Umbrella Safety Module. In case of a shortfall event, these tokens are seized and used to burn debt, just as the StkGHO Umbrella Safety Module will function.

Most of the Aave protocol debt is in wETH and stablecoins.

Therefore, we are gathering feedback on the initiation of Umbrella Atoken Safety Modules with awETH and aUSDC.

This allows for covering most of the debt in the protocol if these assets need to be mobilized.
Because debt can be repaid in aTokens in Aave V3, the available secondary liquidity of these aTokens is not relevant in excess debt clearing.

To cover debt labeled in other assets, USDC and ETH are the most liquid assets in the ecosystem, making slippage considerations a low issue, especially with a focused scope of Safety Module coverage introduced earlier.

aTokens Safety Modules are proposed to be primarily rewarded in their respective aTokens, financed by their respective Reserve Factor collection on their assets and correlated assets.

Umbrella multi-reward support allows for more mid-term synergies for “Re-Staking”, which will be explored further in this TEMP CHECK.

Details and budgets of these Umbrella Atokens Safety modules should be discussed at the ARFC stage with feedback from both Risk & Finance teams.

We’re confident this will allow a factually superior coverage of the Aave V3 protocol at a fraction of the current costs.

### Activate a ""Buy & Distribute"" Program

With the new efficient Umbrella safety modules, it is expected that the protocol revenue surplus will increase. With sustainability reached milestones, this net excess revenue should be mobilized and redirected to token stakers currently funded via the ecosystem rewards contract.

In terms of rewards, the ecosystem rewards will eventually run out of funds. That being said, we propose that StkAAVE remains compensated in AAVE tokens as stakers are already aligned with the asset. To achieve this, a ""Buy & Distribute"" program is introduced to acquire AAVE assets on secondary markets from protocol revenue and distribute them to the ecosystem reserve. This upgrades the current AAVE safety module in a new “Staking Module”, not part of Umbrella.

There's little to no difference in user experience from the current situation, but in terms of protocol sustainability, it's a paradigm shift. This new system also introduces a constant demand side for the AAVE asset on secondary markets.

It is proposed that this program be funded with the net excess revenue of the protocol.

Rewards rates will be defined according to protocol net excess revenue and will reflect the actual financial results of the protocols, with periods of higher rewards to potential periods with zero yield.

We propose that the Aave Finance service providers manage the ""Buy & Distribute"" program via treasury AIPs to increase efficiency in the short term. We believe this process also needs to be part of the Journey of decentralization, and we expect the Aave Finance service providers to contribute to a future with the human element as removed as possible from this program

## “Re-Staking” Umbrella Beyond Aave

Aave's Safety track record speaks for itself; while Aave had several excess debt events, the DAO never had to mobilize the legacy Safety module. With the Umbrella upgrade, we expect the efficient coverage to increase significantly compared to the current situation, from a theoretical $100m to likely billions of mid-terms.

The Aave DAO can mobilize and monetize this coverage beyond the Aave protocol. The Aave DAO service providers are risk experts who can give valuable coverage recommendations to the Aave governance.

The Umbrella multi-token incentives controller allows for rewards in several tokens, and we believe this cost-efficient coverage of already existing significant liquidity will be of high interest for third-party protocols and networks, as shown by the high interest of the “Restaking” DeFi vertical.

While the journey to maturity on this vertical is still long, the ACI wanted to share this mid-term vision to the community of a potential new journey for protocol revenue and Umbrella Stakers Yield.

## Specification

### Milestones and Trigger Conditions

While the Aave protocol's net excess revenues are at an all-time high, it would be reckless to implement significant new budget spending without considering the protocol's long-term sustainability.
From a user experience perspective, a too-ambitious distribution schedule being forced to halt due to more adverse revenue collection conditions will lead to massive and unwanted frustration.
The Aave DAO has always been a conservative actor and has always prioritized long-term sustainability over short-term yield.

We suggest considering the following elements as key data points to execute changes in Safety Modules in steps:

- Aave Collector net holdings
- Service providers' recurring budget
- Merit and ALC program recurring budgets
- GHO supply
- GHO 30-day average revenue
- Protocol 30-day average revenue

The ACI Proposes this vision to be implemented in 3 differents ARFCs to be sequentially proposed alongside reaching set milestones, we welcome governance feedback on this implementation Journey.

## Initial ARFC Doctrine Adoption and Deployment of First Umbrella Safety Module: StkGHO

Adoption of the Following Doctrine:

1. The Current StkAAVE and StkBPT Safety modules becomes the “Legacy Safety Module”
2. The Legacy Safety Module is set to cover all live networks Aave V3 debt with a market size exceeding $100M and older than one year until replaced.
3. The StkGHO Safety modules protect GHO debt.
4. The Safety Modules do not automatically cover Aave V3 deployments; coverage must be opt-in by governance vote.
5. Pre-authorization of introducing ""network-specific"" Umbrella Safety Module instances financed by ""local"" revenue.
6. An Umbrella StkGHO Safety Module is deployed and becomes the first Umbrella Safety module with a reward set exclusively in GHO and financed by Aave protocol excess revenue. The feedback of Aave Finance & Risk service providers is expected to define a Safety Target for this Umbrella Safety Module.
7. The legacy StkGHO safety module cooldown is set to zero; AAVE rewards will not be renewed at distribution expiry.
8. The Merit Program continues as it exists today It will reward the Umbrella StkGHO in the following round its deployment to incentivize user migration

This doctrine would be adopted at the ARFC snapshot Stage.

Trigger milestone:

- Already Achieved

Execution:

- BGD Labs give the greenlight for the Umbrella upgrade, initiate the StkGHO Legacy to Umbrella Migration via AIP.

**Important note:**

As the Umbrella design is still being discussed, details of implementation are subject to change and should be discussed at the ARFC stage of this proposal.

## Part II: Initial ARFC Doctrine Adoption and Deployment of First Umbrella Safety Module: StkGHO

Important note:

As the Umbrella design is still being discussed, details of implementation are subject to change and should be discussed at the ARFC stage of this proposal.

## A new role for Aave beyond the Legacy Safety module, AAVEnomics update.

The next proposed step is the end of the StkAAVE GHO discount, introduce the anti-GHO system, and close the LEND chapter .

Trigger milestones:

- 175M GHO supply
- Secondary liquidity allowing a 10M swap size at 1% price impact

Execution:

- Set borrow rate discount for Aave V3 GHO facilitator to 0%.
- Create new GHO facilitators linked to the GHO credit system.
- Terminate LEND migration contract.

## Part III: ""Fee Switch"" Activate Umbrella Atokens Safety Module, initiate “Buy and Distribute” AAVENomics

Trigger Milestones:

- Aave Collector net holdings are at *2 yearly service providers' recurring costs for the past 30 days.
- Aave protocol 90-day annualized revenue is at 150% of all protocol expenses YTD, including the AAVE acquisition budget and aWETH & aUSDC Umbrella budgets.
- Budget is defined, financed, and readjusted quarterly by Aave Finance service providers.

Execution:

- Financing of secondary liquidity for AAVE with Aave Finance AIPs managed by Aave Finance service providers.
- End of Legacy Safety Module:
    - StkBPT cooldown is set to 0.
    - End of StkBPT rewards. Replaced by liquidity incentives from ALC
    - StkAAVE slashing is set to 0%. StkAAVE becomes the asset of the AAVE Staking module
- Creation of aUSDC and aWETH Umbrella Safety Modules with aUSDC and aWETH as reward tokens. (If validated by governance feedback)
- Financing of AAVE buy and distribute program by Aave Finance service providers; bought AAVE is distributed to the ecosystem reserve. The distribution pace of AAVE is adjusted to the quarterly budget to avoid running out of funds for stakers. This process is handled by the Aave Finance service providers until fully automated.

Important note:

As the Umbrella design is still being discussed, details of implementation are subject to change and should be discussed at the ARFC stage of this proposal. this TEMP CHECK is meant to query community sentiment and ARFC stage is meant to define actual implementation leveraging service providers and community feedback.

The Aave DAO is completed the purchase of 443,674 units of AURA from Olympus DAO with 420,159.28 units of DAI. This publication proposes replenishing the DAO's stable coin holdings by swapping B-80BAL-20wETH for 420,000 GHO. The net affect of the two proposals is to convert B-80BAL-20wETH to AURA.

Details on the DAI for AURA swap can be found [here](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/317/).

# Specification

This proposal will deploy use a version of the Aave Swap Contract and perform the following:

* Transfer B-80BAL-20wETH from Treasury to Aave Swap Contract
* Swap B-80BAL-20wETH to GHO 
* Transfer GHO to the Ethereum Treasury

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Add to rETH Holding
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & @DefiJesus + ACI - @MarcZeller 
created: 2023-10-14

---

# Summary

This publication proposes acquiring rETH with ETH held in the DAO's Ethereum Treasury.

# Abstract

This publication proposes converting a portion of the wETH, awETH and wEthWETH held in the Treasury to rETH.

A balance of 100 aEthWETH will remain in the Treasury to facilitate on going DAO expenses such as the [Quarterly Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680) and any other future expense that arise.

# Motivation

At the time of writing the Aave DAO has the following assets in the Ethereum Treasury:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 14.56 |22,543.32|
|awETH|530.39|820,829.60|
|aEthWETH|510.45 | 789,962.05|

The following assets are available to be claimed from the Paraswap Legacy Fees and Fee Claimer contract:

|Asset|Qty| Value ($)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|wETH| 4.53 |7,011.99|
|wETH| 10.8 |16,717.32|

This publication proposes converting all wETH, awETH and all but 100 aEthWETH to rETH. The 100 aEthWETH is to remain to support on going DAO funding. 

The table below shows the yield differential between the various assets:

|Asset|Yield (%)| 
| --- | --- | 
|wETH| 0.00|
|awETH|1.26|
|aEthWETH|1.97 |
|rETH|3.07|

Based upon current market conditions, the additional yield generated by converting the assets as outlined to rETH is $23,266.50. 

Upon implementation of this [ARFC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-aave-v3-eth-pool-weth-parameters/15110), the additional yield generated is ~$654.42, for the conservative and ~$2,782.86, for the aggressive approach due to the reduction in deposit rates of approximately 10.3 bps and 33.5bps respectively. This does not take into consideration how the market will then adjust after the ETH v3 interst rate parameters are changed. 

# Specification

The following is to be performed:

* Deposit all wETH into aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH)
* Withdraw all awETH (Aave V2 wETH) into ETH
* Withdraw all but 100 aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH) into ETH
* Deposit ETH into RocketPool's rETH
* Transfer rETH into collector

status: Proposal
author: 3SE Holdings

Simple Summary
This ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmony’s Horizon Bridge.

This proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts.

Motivation
The Aave DAO Community, through the governance forum, has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users, Protocol, and DAO. (Harmony Horizon bridge exploit. Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1

This proposed action is a first step that will protect users.It will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue, by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop.

Specification
If passed, this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze() function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony. In addition, passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change (disabling supply and borrow) as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony.",bullish,91.3,2022-07-14 16:09:52+00:00,96.0,96.0,2022-07-16 00:00:00+00:00,5.14786418400876,91.65,0.0038335158817087,0.8929204344749451,True," Title: Aave V3 Harmony - Reserve Freeze Proposal

[ARC] Change Admin role of Optimism and Arbitrum V3 markets

Simple Summary:

Aave V3 Arbitrum & Optimism markets are currently governed by the Community Guardian, a 6/10 elected multisig of 10 Aave community members with the responsibility to enforce community decisions on snapshot on-chain.

This ARC intends to replace the community guardian in favor of Aave governance contracts for the administration of Arbitrum & Optimism V3 markets.

Motivation:

As cross-chain governance bridges received recent audits and in favor of more decentralization of Aave, this AIP intends to fade the community guardian role in Arbitrum and Optimism V3 markets in favor of Aave governance contracts.

This means that if this AIP is validated by Aave governance, every AIP concerning the Arbitrum and OP markets will require an On-chain AIP vote to directly modify the Aave V3 markets on these networks for example onboard a new asset or change an asset risk parameters.

The community guardian multisig always has been presented as a temporary solution in the wait of a cross-chain messaging solution allowing the Aave governance contracts to enforce directly onchain with no trusted intermediary for the governance decisions.

Fading the guardian role is a step forward in Aave protocol decentralization.

if this AIP gathers governance approval, the community guardian will keep an “emergency failsafe” role with the ability to freeze markets or cancel AIPs votes to protect the Aave markets in case of crisis or malicious AIPs.

The cross-chain governance bridge contract that allows more decentralization of the Aave protocol has been audited by ChainSecurity and Certora, and a report of the audit of this contract can be found in the technical link section of this AIP.

Technical specifications:

The cross-chain governance bridges is a set of smart contracts that serve as an extension of the Ethereum Aave Governance, receiving the approved actions by the community in Ethereum, and executing them in the target chain.

The details of the actions are described in a message which is passed from the L1 Aave Governance Executor contract using the native messaging mechanism of the chain:

For Arbitrum, via creation of a retrayable ticket in the Arbitrum Inbox contract on Ethereum.
For Optimism, via sending a message using the OVM L1 Cross Domain Messenger contract on Ethereum.
The recipient of the bridged actions are the governance bridge contracts. Once actions reach these contracts, they are registered in the execution queue so they can be executed after a delay period. Queued actions are susceptible to being canceled for a period of time (e.g. grace period) by the Guardian. This is an “emergency failsafe”, a mechanism to protect the market in the target chain in case there is malicious or illegitimate action. This is a last-resort instrument that can be used by the Community Guardian Multisig.

A detailed specification of the contracts and workflow is outlined in this repository.

Title: [ARFC] Framework for ARFC and TEMP CHECK Proposals
Author: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative
Date: 2023-06-27
---

## Summary

This framework provides comprehensive guidelines for the Aave DAO community when creating and voting on ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) and TEMP CHECK proposals. It includes a template for crafting proposals and outlines the quorum and voting requirements.

## Motivation

### Distinction Between TEMP CHECK and ARFC

TEMP CHECKs serve as ""temperature checks"" to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.

Conversely, ARFCs are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.

### Proposal Template

Each proposal **must** include the following sections:

A header:
1. **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for the proposal, including the proposal type (ARFC or TEMP CHECK) in a [TAG] format.
2. **Author**: The name of the author and/or entity creating the proposal.
3. **Date**: The date the proposal is being made, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

A proposal body:

1. **Summary**: A succinct summary of the proposal.
2. **Motivation**: A detailed presentation of the proposal and potential benefits for the Aave protocol. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
3. **Specification**: A comprehensive description of the proposed change, including any relevant parameters or risk considerations. For ARFCs, this section should be technical, detailing the specific changes to be made. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.
4. **Disclaimer**: Any necessary disclaimers, such as conflicts of interest or third-party involvement.
5. **Next Steps**: The proposed next steps if the proposal is approved.
6. **Copyright**: A statement defining proposal copyright. While Open-Source is **mandatory**, the choice of a specific license is left to the author.

### Voting Guidelines

1. **Vote Start Time**: The vote should commence 24 hours after the proposal is published on Snapshot.
2. **Proposal Age**: The governance thread related to the snapshot vote should be at least 5 days old before voting begins.
3. **Vote Duration**: The vote should last for a minimum of 3 days.
4. **Vote Options**: The vote should have at least three options: YAE (Yes), NAY (No), and ABSTAIN.
5. **Quorum**: The vote should reach a quorum of 320,000 YAE votes.
6. **Differential**: The YAE votes should exceed the second-largest vote option (either NAY or ABSTAIN) by at least 80,000.

### Proposal Cycle:

![image|1920x920](upload://fPsMYVukUCZ2OFHwDUzkFUgc9dw.jpeg)

### Special Considerations

This framework should be considered as a general template for general proposals. Specific proposals and/or frameworks, such as asset onboarding or caps updates, should follow specific guidelines as determined by the Aave DAO community.

This framework is designed to ensure that all proposals are thoroughly considered and that all votes are fair and representative of the Aave DAO community's views.

## Specification

As this proposal pertains to governance guidelines, it does not require any on-chain action or protocol change.

## Disclaimer

The ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.

## Next Steps 

1) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2) If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted.

title: ""[Temp Check] GHO Bounty for Integration Issue Detection""
author: ""AaveCo""
discussions: ""https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-bounty-for-integration-issue-detection/15296""
---

## Simple Summary

This TEMP CHECK proposes a bounty to a community member of 50,000 GHO for coming forward and reporting an incident.

## Motivation

Bounty of 50,000 GHO for notifying the Aave team of an issue which as a precaution triggered the pausing of the GHO market. 

This proposal is to acknowledge and appreciate the collaboration and diligence demonstrated by the individual who initially brought attention to an issue on the frontend. Their efforts ultimately led to the discovery of the underlying problem. Their proactive involvement, although not a direct report, was instrumental in bringing this matter to our attention. Subsequently, with their assistance and the ongoing cooperation of BGD Labs and Certora, we were able to pinpoint and, effectively, resolve the root issue.

In recognition of their valuable contribution to the protocol’s security and stability, we recommend that the DAO consider awarding a bounty of 50,000 GHO to this individual. It is worth noting that while their input may not align precisely with the conventional definition of a vulnerability report, their insights were of paramount importance in instigating an internal investigation.


## Specification

This TEMP CHECK executes a single transfer of 50,000 GHO to receiver address

## Next Steps

If Snapshot is successful then move to AIP

author: @oneski22, @khan
description: A process for prospective GHO Facilitators to apply to be onboarded into the GHO deployment operated by the Aave DAO
created: 2023-03-24

## Abstract
This proposal aims to enact a new governance process by which interested parties may apply to the Aave DAO to have addresses be onboarded as GHO Facilitators. The authors propose a process by which interested parties publish an application to the Aave Forum (governance.aave.com 1), after a period of discussion and comment, an offchain vote is taken using Snapshot. Should that temperature check vote be successful, an on-chain vote targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor will formally add the address and its initial cap to the GHO system as a facilitator. This post outlines the process in detail, an addition includes 2 sample applications for each of the facilitators Aave Companies has released publicly, Aave V3 & Flash Minter.

## Motivation
The GHO Stablecoin Protocol will be governed by the Aave DAO, specifically the Aave DAO Short Executor. There are 3 new processes that the Aave DAO will need to implement:

- a process for facilitator onboarding
- a process for adjustment of a facilitator limit
- a process for facilitator offboarding.

This document only intends to address the first of these processes.

## Implementation
The Facilitator onboarding process will begin with a post on the Aave Governance Forum (governance.aave.com 1) conforming to the template below. Next, a 7 day discussion period will commence for the community to ask questions. After the discussion period a snapshot temperature check can be posted on Snapshot. The standard snapshot process with an informal quorum of 320,000 votes is suggested to ensure sufficient community input is received and to keep consistency with existing governance processes. Should the temperature check be successful, another discussion period of 7 days will commence for the community to further refine the proposal. The authors hope that during this second period technical and risk contributors especially provide feedback on the proposed facilitator design, terms of the credit line and the initial GHO limit being requested. Following this second discussion period, an on-chain proposal targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor can then be posted via the Aave DAO Governance contracts to formally on-board the facilitator with its initial GHO limit.

Title: [ARFC Addendum] Update Asset Onboarding Framework 
Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)
Date: 2024-06-06

---

## **Summary**

The current ARFC Addendum proposes an update to the [Asset Onboarding Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-update-the-asset-onboarding-framework/15629/10). Since the Asset Onboarding Framework was published in the Forum in November 2023, there have been several requests from teams to list their assets, and the corresponding governance process for adding new markets.

This proposal aims to streamline the listing process for Aave DAO by requiring new listing candidates to deposit at least $100 worth of the intended asset into the Aave Short Executor.

# **Motivation**

As part of the deployment process for any new asset, a small amount of the asset is deposited at the moment the market is seeded. This prevents potential market manipulation and issues from arising. In the past, members of Aave DAO have had to purchase all newly listed assets and deposit them into the Aave Short Executor to allow this initial deposit process to occur. In order to simplify the process for members of the Aave DAO and demonstrate commitment from projects getting an Aave onboarding, this proposal requires a deposit of $100 worth of the intended asset.

This amount will be used to seed the markets upon launch.

this deposit is not meant to be an “onboarding fee”

The goal is to make the process more seamless for the implementation of onboarding, as sourcing tokens & feeding the executors’ contracts adds friction in our current onboarding pipeline.  

# **Specification**

1. Deposit requirement:
    1. Each new listing candidate will deposit $100 worth of the intended asset into the Aave Short Executor.
    2. The deposit will serve as both a commitment to the process and a way to initially seed the market.
    3. The deposit will be made:
        1. Once an asset has passed the associated ARFC
        2. It must be deposited before an asset can proceed to the AIP phase
    4. The deposit will be non-refundable. If the proposal does not pass at AIP, the deposit will not be refunded.

# Disclaimer

The ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.

# Next Steps

1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC Addendum], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.
2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, the Addendum will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted into the Asset Onboarding Framework.

This is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s sETH2 on AAVE.

# Motivation

Staking is foundational to the Ethereum network, with liquid staking specifically providing users with the opportunity to unlock the power of their staked capital. One of the most requested features within our protocol is the ability to utilise sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.

sETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH specifically, given the high correlation between asset prices. Following the launch of eMode within Aave V3, sETH2 would allow for leveraged ETH staking without taking on a lot of risk. Lido’s stETH has proven to be a valuable collateral asset within the Aave ecosystem and it’s time to explore adding sETH2, the second most liquid ETH staking token. This integration would benefit both StakeWise and Aave, bringing new users to both platforms.

# Specifications

**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**

I (Jordan Sutcliffe) am the BizDev Lead at StakeWise, submitting the proposal on behalf of StakeWise DAO.

**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**

->*StakeWise Overview*

StakeWise is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry, such as requiring 32 ETH and the expertise needed for maintaining staking infrastructure, allowing anyone to benefit from the rewards of the Beacon Chain.

ETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenised into sETH2, representing users’ interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2 (note this application will focus solely on sETH2).

As a liquid staking platform, users are free to un-stake at any time by trading their sETH2 back into ETH utilising the protocol’s deep liquidity pools.

Dmitri Tsumak first announced StakeWise was under development in April 2020. StakeWise launched on mainnet in March 2021, following a 9-month beta phase. StakeWise was the first staking pool to move to non-custodial staking in April 2021 and has since grown to over 70k ETH staked, helping DAOs, whales and individuals alike. In January 2022, the StakeWise Metro upgrade was announced, commencing the decentralisation of the protocol. Further information on Metro can be found [here](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8).

StakeWise has been audited by [Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits).

->*sETH2 Overview*

sETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenised staking deposit into StakeWise’s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1-to-1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts as an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH (not re-pricing or rebalancing), providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2.

sETH2 supply sits at [59,266](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a) (~$200M), held by ~3k individual users. The main liquidity pool for sETH2 is on UniSwap ([here](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)). This pool has ~$160M TVL, consisting of ~26k ETH and ~30k sETH2. StakeWise is in the process of launching a second liquidity pool on Curve, with further details provided below.

**Explain the positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**

sETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH, given the high correlation and the proven peg stability of sETH2 (detailed further below). This makes sETH2 a prime candidate for Aave’s new eMode to enable leveraged staking.

sETH2 collateral would also allow holders to take speculative positions, such as shorting an asset or taking a leveraged long position on ETH, for example.

sETH2 has deep liquidity with ~$160M TVL, soon to be spread across multiple pools.

**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**

StakeWise’s background is detailed above.

StakeWise DAO is live and manages the protocol. Whether it is changing the protocol fees, adding node operators to the network or making amendments to smart contracts, all changes require DAO approval. The StakeWise DAO is [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.

Investors in the StakeWise DAO consist of Blockdaemon, boldstart Ventures, Greenfield One, Collider Ventures, Lionschain Capital and gumi Cryptos.

The StakeWise product suite consists of liquid staking on both Ethereum and Gnosis chain, branching out into other PoS networks over time.

**How is the asset currently used?**

First and foremost, sETH2 provides holders, from individual retail stakers to DAOs, the rights to staking rewards from the Beacon Chain.

Creating utility for sETH2 is of the highest priority. Currently, sETH2 can be used to provide liquidity on AMMs, such as UniSwap and Curve. Multiple other integrations are lined up involving sETH2, such as using sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.

**Emission schedule**

There is no emission schedule. sETH2 is minted only when ETH is deposited into the StakeWise staking pool.

**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**

-> *Multi-sigs*

StakeWise has run non-custodial ETH staking since April 2021. Prior to April 2021, a multi-sig was used, named the Horcrux, with ~18k ETH of the StakeWise pool currently controlled by the Horcrux. More info can be found [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/stakewise-pool#the-horcrux).

The DAO treasury is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x144a98cb1CdBb23610501fE6108858D9B7D24934) with a DAO committee of 7 persons. The goal of the DAO committee is to monitor transactions voted upon via Snapshot and reject malicious transactions that would harm the protocol. In order to reject a transaction, a threshold of 4 out of 7 committee members must sign the rejection.

# Risk Assessment

# Security Considerations

-> *Counterparty risks*

StakeWise relies on an Oracle network to accurately report daily staking rewards to the rETH2 smart contract in order to mint and distribute the correct amount of rETH2. Currently, there are 5 oracles live with details provided [here](https://launchpad.eatsteakbewise.com/oraclestatus-mainnet.html). Note that the number of oracles on the network will be increasing from 5 to 10 over the coming months.

4 out of the 5 oracles are required to submit the same rewards data for the total supply of rETH2 is updated. Further information is found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/oracle/blob/master/README.md).

As previously detailed, the protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO. Extra security features are in place to stop malicious transactions from passing through the DAO. For example, each successful on-chain proposal must undergo two days of escalation game, before entering one day of the multi-sig backstop period.

-> *Staking risks*

sETH2 holders are exposed to risks associated with staking, such as slashing events and downtime penalties. The StakeWise DAO has taken steps to mitigate these risks:

* Prospective node operators are vetted by the validator committee, required to enter a testnet and must pass situational stress testing. Only then will the StakeWise DAO vote for whether an operator can join the network. StakeWise only on-boards leading node operators to ensure the highest security and yield for its users.
* StakeWise provides node operators with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, such as the ability to quickly transition between staking clients on demand.
* There is no staking insurance currently in place, however we are working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance as a high priority (expected to be in place by early May).

Note that hostage risks are common in liquid staking pools, however this does not apply to StakeWise. The StakeWise DAO controls the exit signatures for its operators, allowing the DAO to force exit validators from the network should the situation arise. This makes it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage and will ensure that all future staking rewards, such as MEV and tips, flow to the pool.

StakeWise has experienced no slashing or downtime penalties to date.

-> *Smart Contract Risks*

Stakers are exposed to smart contract risk. To mitigate this, the protocol has undergone audits by 3 separate auditors: Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)). Our code is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts).

Despite having no security concerns to date, StakeWise is committed to reducing the risk for its users and is in the process of adding a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI.

-> *Price Oracles*

sETH2 currently relies on a UniSwap TWAP oracle. With the addition of new liquidity pools, we will be upgrading our oracle to a Chainlink oracle over the coming months.

# Proposed Risk Parameters

* LTV: 70% (vs 82.5% for ETH)
* Liquidation Threshold: 75% (vs 85% for ETH)
* Liquidation Bonus: 7.5% (vs 5% for ETH)
* Reserve Factor: 10% (vs 10% for ETH)

The proposed sETH2 risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH. ETH and sETH2 are highly correlated, and as such, have similar volatility profiles. The LTV and liquidity threshold below that of ETH account for the extra risks associated with liquidating sETH2.

This ARFC proposes to make adjustments to stablecoin interest rate models across Aave v2 and v3 markets. Specifically, this ARFC proposes to increase the slope 1 parameter for stablecoins to implement a 5% optimal borrow rate.

Forum discussion thread linked [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096).

### Motivation

Over the past several months, equilibrium stablecoin borrowing costs across the broader defi space have trended upwards, and may now be higher than the governance defined “optimal borrow rate” set within Aave’s stablecoin interest rate models. For example, Maker borrow and supply (DSR) rates have been mostly over 5% since mid August. Rates in tradfi have also risen significantly, with short term treasury bills yielding around 5.5% and even long term treasury rates rising to nearly 5% across various maturities.

This mismatch between Aave’s rate models and the broader market leads to a range of potential inefficiencies, including deadweight loss from the cost of liquidity being artificially constrained away from equilibrium value, and negative UX impact due to greater rate volatility when utilization is above the optimal ratio.

First, we present data backing up the assertion that Aave’s current stablecoin rate models are not finding efficient market equilibriums. Then, we discuss the negative impacts of this including deadweight loss and UX impacts. Finally, we present a plan of adjustment that we estimate will address the market inefficiencies and lead to improved market utility across borrowers, suppliers, and the community of AAVE token holders.

#### UX Impacts

We gathered block by block interest rate data for the largest stablecoin markets across v2 and v3 (USDC, USDT, and DAI) from 1 August to 7 October, block numbers 17816255 to 18300344. 

In the middle of this period (28 August), Aave governance executed proposal 306, which added sDAI as collateral on v3 while increasing the slope1 parameter for DAI to 5% on both v2 and v3. This offers useful data to A/B test the premise of whether increasing the borrow rate at optimal utilization can help improve market functioning.

Reviewing data for the Aave v3 DAI market, we can see that the increase in slope1 was strikingly effective at reducing borrow rate volatility, with the percent of time utilization was above optimal point falling from 62% to below 1%. There were some confounding factors, such as market turbulence over CRV leveraged positions at the beginning of August, and Maker’s elevated 8% DSR rate effective from 4 August to 18 August. But we can see heightened rate volatility from utilization exceeding the optimal ratio persists even excluding these periods.

Source: [Block Analitica Aave Dashboard (DAI v3)](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/DAI/)

Comparing this with historical rates data for Ethereum v3 USDC and USDT markets (shown below), we can see a significant reduction in borrow rate volatility from the increase in the slope1 parameter. Note that the USDC market seems to exhibit higher volatility because it has a slope1 parameter of 3.5%, vs 4% for the USDT market.

Source: [Block Analitica Aave Dashboard (USDT v3)](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/USDT/)

We can expect reduced rate volatility to drive an increase in borrower participation. Paradoxically, raising the slope1 parameter for the DAI markets also seems to have been associated with a reduction in average (geometric mean) borrowing rates; for example, the average v3 DAI borrow cost from 1 August to 28 August (when proposal 306 was executed) was 6.49%, while the average rate from 28 August to 7 October was 4.56%.

Looking at the USDC v3 market over the same 28 August to 7 September period, we see the average (geometric mean) borrowing rates were 4.52%, so similar to DAI after the adjustment to interest rate models but with much higher volatility. This supports the notion that raising slope1 can bring greater rate stability without negatively impacting borrower welfare.

#### Deadweight Loss

Deadweight loss is an economic concept that describes the loss of total utility created by a market when prices are artificially constrained either above or below the optimal equilibrium where supply and demand are in balance.

It is commonly demonstrated with graphs of the supply and demand curve; any quantities exchanged below borrowers’ (consumers’) marginal willingness to pay represents consumer surplus, while quantities exchanged over suppliers’ (producers’) marginal willingness to produce represents producer surplus, and together these represent the markets overall utility.

![image](ipfs://bafkreiaxeijjhirs447bgwpqjltouti3kyjkilleuqob3tjq43j7apzmkm)
    
When prices are artificially constrained above or below the market equilibrium, this leads to a lower quantity of goods exchanged, which reduces the total area of consumer and producer surplus and creates an area on the graph showing reduced utility known as deadweight loss.
 
![image](ipfs://bafkreiaybtbjwlkyvl2bcak57kpmvdf2ozuwoxvs5anc7pi27ol767mbqa)
    
With borrowing rates at optimal utilization falling below broader market levels, this can have the unintentional effect of constraining price below equilibrium value, which reduces overall utility of the Aave stablecoin markets. This has a likelihood to constrain market size growth over the medium term as suppliers are insufficiently incentivized to deposit more capital, while borrowers have a very low amount of liquidity available at reasonable prices before pushing the utilization above the optimal point and potentially pushing rates far above the market equilibrium.

### Proposed Adjustments

We propose an adjustment to the variable slope1 parameter for stablecoins across Aave v2 and v3 markets to better align optimal utilization rates with the broader market. While the proposal initially referred only to Ethereum markets, we see similar high rate conditions persisting across markets on other chains and risk service providers have indicated support for updating optimal rates across all active Aave deployments.

This will result in borrowing rates at optimal utilization still being equal or slightly below most other defi options (eg. Maker and Spark rates), while significantly increasing supply rates. Increasing the expected supply rates for stablecoins on Aave v3 Ethereum market may lead to a bit more downward price pressure on GHO, but this is not expected to be material considering that users can already borrow GHO with sDAI collateral (at 5% collateral yield, likely higher than the average for other stablecoin markets after this change) and Aave governance is also considering additional measures to support the GHO peg.

Title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings

Author: @Dydymoon

Date: 2023-09-26

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Summary
Following the approval of this TEMP CHECK explaining AIP-42 potential impacts, this proposal will evaluate options to update holdings to maintain maximum emission power by acquiring AURA tokens to keep being exposed to the Balancer ecosystem while optimizing the voting power.

# Context

AIP-42 leads to a decorrelation of the incentives amounts generated on veBAL & vlAURA, as veBAL emission power is limited to BAL + base Aura rewards, while vlAURA receives additional AURA rewards allocated by the DAO treasury.

Looking at the vote incentives market a few weeks after the update went live, we can observe that the majority of cost paid per vote decreased on both layers. However, it’s common to still see projects overpaying so it might take more time for the full market to understand these changes.

For more context, some veBAL holders voted for the GHO gauges over the past two months without receiving bribes, enabling to generate ~ $300k of incentives on GHO gauges.

# Motivation

This proposal aims to propose several options to update the Balancer ecosystem holdings of the DAO by acquiring AURA to increase its maximum emission power.

*Current data (September 30th)*
AURA price: 0,84$
veBAL/vlAURA ratio: 0,1598
veBAL value acquired per 1$ of vlAURA bought: 1,88$.

## Initial Est. veBAL position

Aave DAO acquisition of 157K B-80BAL_20WETH was executed on this proposal 2. If the full amount was locked, the weekly emissions value would be ~ $7,7K per week.

## Current DAO holdings

Shortly after this proposal 4 was submitted, TokenLogic submitted two proposals: a first time sensitive one to acquire 443k AURA OTC from Olympus DAO with DAI 1, executed on this AIP, and another to sell the corresponding value in BPT for GHO 2, approved on the following TEMP CHECK.

The table below shows the Olympus OTC deal data & impact on Aave treasury once executed using current GHO & BPT prices.

If the DAO was to lock its remaining BPT & AURA holdings now, the weekly emissions value generated would be ~ $10,8K / week.

## Improvement scenarios

While an increase can be observed (7,7k to10,8k/week), the maximum emissions can still be improved, either by optimizing or increasing and diversifying the exposure. The tables below show an emission power overview post AIP-42 for both cases.

The current situation would also require to vote on both layers, which complexifies the management, however this option will be possible as Llama’s SAM contract upgrade ARFC to support both veBAL & vlAURA, and propose to grant the asset manager role to the committee will be published in the coming days (code currently in review by BGD).

As described in both options above, the goal of this ARFC is to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA units, either with BPT or with stables. The Option 3 proposed in the comments aims to find a compromise for all stakeholders by acquiring ~ 950K AURA units and staking BPT holdings.

### 1) Convert to remaining BPT to AURA

This option considers optimizing the current holding by selling the remaining BPT for AURA, which will improve the gauge power owned without spending more funds to increase the exposure value.

Despite proposing to convert BPT, Balancer remains a strategic partner and this acquisition will actually enable the DAO to grow more liquidity on Balancer, and partially support the SM strategy once live, creating an important amount of bribes for veBAL holders.

If the DAO was to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA, the weekly emissions value would currently be ~ $20,1K / week (almost twice the current situation including votes on both layers).

#### Pros:

- Maximal emission power (Full vlAURA)
- No extra investment (BPT conversion)
- Simple management (Vote on one layer only)
- Less locking restrictions (No decay & 4 months lock)
- Will enable to grow more liqudity on Balancer

#### Cons:

- Sell BPT acquired to lock veBAL according to the partnership (limited price impact)
- Can be considered as unfair for veBAL holders who supported GHO at launch
- Balancer DAO might sell the AAVE acquired during the TokenSwap

### 2) Keep remaining BPT & acquire AURA to lock both

After receiving some feedback including concerns about selling BPT (initially acquired before AIP-42 at the Balancer partnership to lock for veBAL), this option considers to retain the BPT for veBAL and acquire additional ~ 1,3M AURA to lock for vlAURA with stables from the treasury which increases both the emission power & the exposure value.

If the DAO was to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA with stables and lock the remaining BPT holdings, the weekly emissions value generated would be ~ $25,7K / week.

While this improves weekly emissions by $5,6K, this strategy is less efficient compared to the above as it would complexify the management with the need to vote on both layers (one on-chain, one off-chain), relock the veBAL holdings, manage the two voting periods (weeks/rounds), and cost an extra $1M in stables from the DAO treasury.

#### Pros:
- Increased overall emission power of the Aave DAO (veBAL + vlAURA)
- Favor good relations with Balancer by following the initial partnership proposal.

#### Cons:

- $1M extra investment (AURA acquisition with stables)
- More complex management (Vote on two different layers)
- Includes veBAL restrictions (Voting power decay & up to 1 year lock)
- Emission power not fully optimized

*(Despite its maximal estimated efficiency, there isn’t an option to convert both BPT holdings + $1M for AURA as this amount would be complex to acquire with the current liquidity available)*

### 3) Mint auraBAL & use BAL, use USDC/AAVE rewards for bribes & lock AURA rewards + Acquire $800K of AURA

This was initially suggested by Karpatkey in the comments, and updated to this revised option which aims to find a good compromise for all stakeholders.  

The major update is the consideration of the classic auraBAL staking to allocate BPT instead of converting it to AURA. This strategy earns 18% APR in BAL + AUR, which can be used to create bribes & compensate for the reduced acquisition. 

AURA can be accumulated to be locked for vlAURA, and the amount can be replaced with USDC/AAVE to maintain the rewards value which will be used for bribes with the BAL. 

This also reduces the AURA market buy from $1M stables (in Option 1 & 2) to 800K$ in the Option 3: 
- $400K on market (400K USDC) 
- $200K token swap with the Aura DAO (2950 AAVE)
- $200K OTC Deal with AEF & Contributors (200K USDC)

* Emission power with vlAURA to be acquired: 

If the DAO was to acquire ~ 950K AURA as described above, in addition to 440K acquired from Olympus, the weekly emissions value would be ~ $16,2K / week.

* Emission power with auraBAL staking rewards used for bribes: 

If the DAO was to stake all the auraBAL minted with BPT in the classic staking, the weekly rewards would be ~ $5,4K / week. Assuming a weekly vlAURA bribe cost of $0,007 / week,  ~ $8,9K / week can be obtained in emissions. 

Option 3 Total weekly emissions: $16,2K + $8,9K =  $25,2K / week

#### Pros:

- Mint & stake auraBAL instead of selling BPTs
- Very good emission power (vlAURA votes & bribes)
- Simple management (Vote & bribe on one layer only)
- Less locking restrictions (No veBAL decay & 4 months lock)
- Reduce AURA amount to acquire on market ($400K vs $1,1M)
- AURA long term accumulation (rewards replaced for bribes)
- Increase veBAL/vlAURA ratio
- 1,4M vlAURA locked & 157k BPT staked ( good for Aura)

#### Cons:

- Complexify the strategy implementation (where to stake auraBAL to be defined)
- Complexify rewards management (AURA to be lock, BAL + equiv USDC for bribes)
- Requires a $800K extra investment (including $200K in AAVE & $600K in USDC)
- Low liquidity & trading volume on auraBAL

In terms of emission value, the revised Option 3 proposed is similar to Option 2, which was the highest amount proposed ($25,7K vs $25,2K weekly).

# Acquisition details

Regardless of which option above is voted on the ARFC, the proposal is to acquire AURA with USDC on market to reduce the price impact. If anyone reading this is interested in selling AURA OTC, feel free to comment.

Some Aura contributors & the Aura Ecosystem Fund Committee proposed a 200k AURA OTC deal for USDC (available on September 29th), using a TWAP price from the ARFC forum (posted on September 26th with Snapshot vote starting on September 29th) until snapshot vote ended if approved (October 4th).

Overview of the AEF deal using the current AURA price to facilitate estimations but may vary depending on the TWAP price:

The optimal way to execute these market transactions seems to be using the TWAP orders from Cowswap to split the trades into several orders.

While the price impact of selling the remaining BPT for USDC in one transaction is limited (3,5%), this can be reduced to 2,2% with a split of 5 orders. For AURA, the price impact if acquired in one transaction is quite important (42%), but this can also be reduced to 5,7% with a split of 10 orders.

OTC acquisition: If the Aura contributors & AEF deal is approved, the 200k OTC can be implemented using a similar contract to the one used for the Olympus deal (only difference being the price defined with a TWAP). This AIP execution should fall under ACI’s Skyward program scope.

Market acquisition: As AURA are likely to be mostly bought on market using TWAP orders which can be used with a Safe, the AURA buy and potential BPT sell can be executed by the GHO liquidity committee using the multisig once live (require a fallback handler on it). 

This should simplify the acquisition compared to creating new contracts for this purpose. More information on TWAP orders can be found here.

# Next Steps

If Option 1:

- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for AEF OTC deal
- (AIP) Transfer all BPT from the collector to the committee multisig
- Committee start TWAP orders BPT for USDC
- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA
- Committee transfer back USDC equivalent for OTC deal on the Collector
- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed

If Option 2:

- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for Aura deal
- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to the committee multisig
- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA
- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed

If Option 3: 

- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for AEF deal
- (AIP) Transfer AAVE from the ecosystem reserve to tokenswap contract for Aura deal
- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to the committee multisig for market buy 
- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA
- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed

## Voting Options TLDR 

- YAE (Option 1): Convert BPT for AURA to lock vlAURA 
- YAE (Option 2): Lock BPT for veBAL + buy AURA ($1M in USDC) to lock vlAURA
- YAE (Option 3): Mint auraBAL with BPT & use rewards for bribes + buy AURA ($800k in USDC & AAVE) to lock vlAURA 
- NAY: Do nothing 
- ABSTAIN

Gauntlet's risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify risk parameters, including Loan To Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across 5 assets on Ethereum v3, Arbitrum v3 and Ethereum v2. For more details, see the full forum post [here]( https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825/1).


## Motivation

These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations and they seek to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, the expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics shown in the [full forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825) can help understand why some parameter recommendations have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for the recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.
For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

## Specification

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at reasonable levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. Our simulations show that we can improve the balance of risk and capital efficiency by making the parameter changes specified below.

Ethereum Aave v3 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|DAI Loan to Value |67%|77%
|USDC Liquidation Threshold|79%|80%
|WSTETH Liquidation Bonus|7%|6%

Arbitrum Aave v3 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|LINK Liquidation Threshold	|75%|77.5%

Ethereum Aave v2 Parameter Changes Specification
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|SNX Liquidation Threshold|62%|59%

Lowering SNX LT by 3% will liquidate 0xf81c8b55c2499af43ec387977c1d9cb1f1c78bca, who currently has HF 1.02 and supplies $50 SNX to borrow $30 USDT.

## Risk Dashboard
The community should use [Gauntlet’s Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk.

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile insolvency value that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

**Author:** @AaveCompanies
**Date:** 19th July 2023

# Summary

This TEMP CHECK requests approval for the introduction of a Peg Stability Module for GHO (The GHO Stability Module) as referenced in this [Development Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/gho-development-update-testnet-release/11631).

# Motivation
## Overview
A Peg Stability Module (PSM) is a contract that enables the seamless conversion of two tokens at a predetermined ratio. This mechanism has proven effective for numerous stablecoin projects, such as MakerDAO in preserving the stability exchange rates. Using this model as inspiration, the proposed Stability Module for GHO leverages the benefits of existing models whilst innovating upon them in several ways to help further  maintain GHO’s peg.

## Features

As mentioned, the GHO Stability Module (GSM) is influenced by existing designs, with users being able to convert between GHO and governance-accepted stablecoins at a predetermined ratio. However, the design of the GSM also possesses unique features. 

***Price Strategies***
The GSM introduces the concept of Price Strategies which provide the ability to adjust the pricing ratio between GHO and the exogenous asset, based on different strategies. Pricing strategies oversee the calculation of the price ratio, and:
- Can be fixed. 
- Can be dynamic, based on price oracles and markets, linear curves, stableswap curves, etc.

For the initial launch, we recommend implementing a Fixed Pricing Strategy. 

However, should the DAO choose to transition to a dynamic pricing strategy in the future, this shift can be facilitated through an AIP. The change would involve deploying a new Price Strategy contract and update the GSM to make use of the new Price Strategy. 

***The Debt Ceiling***

The DAO may want to limit exposure to specific assets backing GHO through the GSM. The Debt Ceiling gives the DAO the ability to control the maximum exposure to the exogenous asset.

If a user tries to mint GHO and the amount of exogenous assets backing the issued GHO is higher than the Debt Ceiling, it reverts.

***The Capital Allocator***

The Capital Allocator provides a method through which a pre-defined portion of exogenous assets in the GSM can be used by a “fund manager” to allocate and earn yield.

The amount of funds that can be used is defined through a configurable threshold which is proposed to be decided through a separate governance process.

***Last Resort Liquidations***

 In case of a rapid increase in risk in an exogenous asset, the GSM features Last Resort Liquidations to liquidate the exogenous asset. This special contract role allows --  in the worst-case scenarios -- for the DAO to take control of the asset (as a whole), thus pausing the GSM.

***Price Bounds and Swap Freezes***

In case the price of the exogenous asset deviates from the 1:1 ratio, trading can be stopped using Price Bounds and Swap Freezes. 

Last Resort Liquidations, Price Bounds and Swap Freezes are enabled by an external contract granted with a special role that can pause trading. This contract has a function that will look up the price of the exogenous asset, and if it is outside of a certain bound, react accordingly.

# Next Steps
If this TEMP CHECK receives community approval at the Snapshot phase, we will:
1.	Engage community auditors for a review of the GSM codebase.
2.	Following the audit, we will share the codebase with the community alongside an ARFC based on the [Facilitator Onboarding Process Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-facilitator-onboarding-process-and-application/12929/)

Moreover, governance will then be able to decide on configurations around many of the GSMs features during the next stage of the governance process. These configurations include but are not limited to:
-	Initial Debt Ceilings
-	Initial Exogenous Assets
-	Initial Pricing Strategy
-	Distribution for Capital Allocation
-	Price Bounds for Swap Freezes

Overall, we are excited to introduce our vision for the GSM to the DAO and believe it will play a key role in peg maintenance.

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - vlAURA
author: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @defiJesus & @efecarranza
created: 2023-11-03

---

# Summary

This publication proposes locking the AURA holding in vlAURA via the Strategic Asset Manager and delegating managing the position to the GHO Liquidity Committee.

# Motivation

The Aave DAO holds a substantial amount of AURA, and the GHO Liquidity Committee (GLC) is actively executing this [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061) by swapping 400,000 USDC worth of AURA on the market.

The next step in implementing the strategy is for the DAO to lock the AURA holdings. This publication proposes sending the AURA to the [Strategic Asset Manager](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#code) (SAM) contract. From here, the full amount of AURA should be locked using [Function 9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#writeProxyContract) for vlAURA. The voting rights are to be delegated to the [GLC](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60) using [Function 5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#writeProxyContract).

The Guardian role on the SAM contract is already configured to the GLC SAFE address. This can be verified using the Read as Proxy [Function 10](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#readProxyContract). The Aave v3 Protocol [shortExecutor](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEE56e2B3D491590B5b31738cC34d5232F378a8D5#internaltx) is set up as the Owner of the SAM contract, as seen via [Function 12](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#readProxyContract). This means the DAO's on-chain governance process can interact with the SAM and, more importantly, retrieve the DAO's funds if anything were to happen to the GLC.

Only the Owner can transfer funds from the SAM, meaning the Guardian (multisig) cannot transfer funds, and the funds can only be transferred to the Treasury, which is [hardcoded](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/208/files#diff-5ee0295025c5828238f7b67392b7e4868cfa5d3e4c11fcb5170cf1abddaa74d7R39) into the contract. This means the auraBAL yield ([2.38%](https://app.aura.finance/#/1/lock)) from vlAURA must be transferred to the Treasury before being transferred to another address where it can be managed.

The one missing piece of functionality in the SAM is the ability to sell the vlAURA voting rights by participating in [Quests](https://quest.paladin.vote/#/bal) on Paladin. This functionality will only take a few days to create before being sent to @bgdlabs for review as part of the normal payload review process.

With the AURA locked in the SAM contract, the GLC is then responsible for managing the DAO's holdings in the best interest of the DAO/GHO. This entails voting on Aura Finance gauges, governance votes in Aave DAO's best interest, and selling vlAURA votes via Paladin when it makes sense to do so.

# Specification

The below details the key steps to be implemented:

* Strategic Assets Manager upgraded to support selling vlAURA voting rights on Paladin
* AURA is transferred to the Strategic Assets Manager contract
* AURA is locked for vlAURA
* Voting rights of vlAURA are to be delegated to the GLC
* GLC is to manage the vlAURA holding

1) Gather community feedback on this ARFC.
2) In 5 days scalate this proposal to the Snapshot ARFC stage.
3) If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.

title: ARC - Consolidate Aave V1, V2 & AMM Reserve Factors, Purchase CVX and Deploy to Earn Yield
author: Llama Community @MatthewGraham @Dydymoon 
created: 03/01/2022

https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797
---

# Simple Summary

The Aave V1, V2, and AMM market Reserve Factors (RF) on the Ethereum network hold a combined value of over [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). The Llama Community proposes consolidating the RF into the V2 RF and deploying the capital with the intention of retaining TVL and earning additional yield. The yield generated comes with the added benefit of acquiring governance tokens of other DeFi protocols and increasing Aave’s metagovernance influence.

# Abstract

The Llama Community recommends implementing several yield generating strategies spanning Balancer, Curve, and Convex and subsequently participating in the respective communities' tokenomic constructs. Aave will earn yield in the form of swap fee income, aToken yield derived from Aave V2, and governance token incentives in the form of BAL, CRV, CVX, stkAAVE and LDO.

The first investment theme is deploying capital into the Balancer Boosted Pool and BTC Stable Pool to earn a vAPY of around 13.4% and 4.6% respectively. The Balancer Boosted Pool invests around 80% or more of the deposited liquidity into Aave V2 to earn yield whilst also generating swap fees, stkAAVE, and BAL rewards. The Stable Pool generates income via swap fees and BAL rewards, with the latter making up the majority of the incentives on both strategies.

The second investment theme is more complex. It involves acquiring both CVX and veCRV to participate in gauge weight voting on Curve in order to influence a portion of the CRV inflation schedules to be distributed to aToken pool Liquidity Providers (LPs). Aave will deploy stables and ETH from the RF to earn additional CRV and CVX rewards, which will be used to further boost the incentive allocation to the aToken pools.

The data presented here is accurate as of the end of December 2021 data.

# Motivation

## Part A - Consolidation

The legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times. There is only ~[$219M](https://app-v1.aave.com/home) of TVL remaining in the V1 market, and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time.

![|602x232](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Kqln89Od7cLnxfnd5sEq4gn6xMD2yrAocqa8nJOaXQoyjQ4GlNkgfw8pQ7E2skefYXPdtiqSLwWL_KtYcNiO6Qjciy0I296Q7eiz0R9_NEO1nhZSPJtMqR-eDXg4N7SOqTj-zsEC)

This proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1, V2, and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield. The V1 RF holds around ~[$821K](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae) of assets at the time of writing, whereas the Ethereum V2 + AMM market holds [$27.45M](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) of assets. Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). A summary of the main assets held in the V1 RF are shown below:

![|602x232](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/947026c5031f95dbb5c76d9939f772d746867d90.png)

## Part B - Retain TVL & Increase Returns

Whilst holding aTokens is arguably one of the lowest risk yield opportunities in DeFi and something Llama Community encourages most, if not all, treasuries to hold. The Aave DAO is fortunate since it receives income in the form of aTokens. Thus, Llama recommends firstly making all unproductive stable coins productive and then optimizing further by earning additional yield and metagovernance influence.

The two main high level strategies proposed in this ARC share three common goals:

* Retain TVL within Aave
* Exceed aToken returns
* Accumulate metagovernance influence

In addition to these three goals, the Convex / Curve strategies have the added benefit of improving the extrinsic use cases for aTokens. aToken holders will be able to deposit liquidity into the Curve aToken pools and then deposit the Liquidity Provider (LP) token into either Curve or Convex to earn additional yield.

The Compound pool on Curve has [$174.5M](https://curve.fi/compound/) of TVL relative to the Aave pool which has [$55.3M](https://curve.fi/aave/) of TVL.This is most likely due to the higher incentive APR that the Compound pool, 10.13% vAPY, relative to the Aave pool earning 7.58% vAPY on Convex.

# Specification

## Overview

Llama proposes diversifying $26,67M (94.36%) of the combined Ethereum RFs across three protocols: Convex, Curve and Balancer. The combined Aave V1, AMM, and V2 market RF totals [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) at the time of writing. A detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the [Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) and a high-level overview is shown in the figure below.

**![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bst-8FdWe_RfGSXcDYeItuso4X58wWylaIo06XSnRjax0JJ7UfnjUPM7p-5bGYdu6QrdtGkkUzbzyu5kLe-4a17tLCFY5WD5Wj6gPD7YSuoHfjVfsqNfy2nlM47NQNmZPp7GeQKH ""Chart"")**

The table below shows the assets that will be deployed within this proposal. Note this is only 94.4% of the assets and 5.6% of the assets are to remain unchanged within the Aave V2 RF.**

![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/c/c10a19f49f9edbbd241d7a280d0a0541e2bf9316.png)


The table above includes the following stablecoins, DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD and sUSD from the Aave V1 and V2 markets. The AMM markets holdings have not been included as they only total $119.3K at the time of writing.

The table below shows asset allocation per each strategy:

The balance within the Aave V2 RF, not deployed in one of the above strategies is shown as Other (Longtailed Assets) in the figure below. The percentages reflect the overall composition of the RF, noting that 94.4% of the consolidated RF is deployed into one of the strabled detailed in the above table.

**![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DLtTpPMVMYL0mhKSaCrroYwwD4r3-3uRDgwUjLIeZjrmMwnQ8i7-PSfgrwnHJLJnd5b4GfeTIhVuaW1emtWc12o-YFyQTqgVMOMyPni023sKbTxZFpyneBVCGu_eV3u-UuvOcsLc ""Chart"")**

The actual implementation of this proposal is likely to be spread across several AIPs. This is to reduce the implementation complexity and allow the several positions to be swapped / redeemed before being deployed into a bonding curve whilst we await the Chainlink CVX oracle being released and getting the Aave V2 RF whitelisted to deposit into the CRV locking contract to attain veCRV.

The subsequent sections provide further insight into each strategy and how they are to be funded.

## Convex / Curve Strategy

### Convex Allocation

The Convex (CVX) allocation is to be funded by the assets mentioned in the table below:

**![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/468f451db851df2f8c4ec9f3bc28fd81647492da.png)**

In order to fund the initial $2M purchase of CVX, all of the AMPL, BUSD and TUSD will be used ($842.2K) and the balance, $1,16M, will be funded with USDC. This is the initial purchase of CVX and with a unit price of $43.20 is equivalent to about 46,300 CVX tokens.

We expect to make additional CVX purchases in order to meet the minimum voting hurdle required to influence how Convex’s veCRV holding is deployed on Curve gauges. Based upon this [snapshot](https://vote.convexfinance.com/#/proposal/QmRgsaGswSgzuzaiiH385StTGsv5TVdhAA1LWBGWR3yyLp) and the [Voting Rules and Information](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/voting-and-gauge-weights) section of Convex’s documentation, we estimate around 70,000 CVX votes are needed to clear the hurdle rate. This is expected to cost a further $1.02M to what is proposed above and represents less than 1 months revenue. We intend to fund this through future revenue and have a sufficient buffer to the hurdle rate based upon voter participation on Convex’s snapshot.

The assets are to be converted to ETH and then used to purchase CVX via a Bonding Curve with a 50 bps premium that utilizes a Chainlink oracle price feed. Alternative methods can be discussed in the comments. However, we opt for a solution that can be implemented entirely through the AIP governance process and does not include manual trading.

AMPL is the most illiquid of the mentioned tokens and this position will need to be converted to ETH over a series of transactions. Trades are to be routed through an aggregator with MEV protection like CowSwap. The most liquid AMPL pools are on Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap. Wherever possible, aTokens will be swapped rather than redeemed in an attempt to retain TVL in the Aave V2 market.

The newly acquired CVX will be locked for 16 weeks with voting rights delegated to Llama in order to vote on both Aave and sAave gauges via Convex’s snapshot to increase the amount of CRV rewards received on the Curve pools. Voting occurs every 2 weeks via Snapshot and thus the need for a delegate.

The locked CVX also receives a portion of the protocol fee income and votes on how Convex’s veCRV are distributed across Curve’s gauges. Llama Community acting as the delegate will vote to boost CRV rewards on the Aave pool as a priority and sAave once sufficient voting influence has been attained.

### 4 Year Locked Curve (veCRV) Allocation

The aCRV tokens that have accumulated within Aave V2 are to be redeemed for CRV and then locked for 4 years on Curve to receive an equal amount of veCRV. This strategy is subject to Aave’s V2 RF being approved and whitelisted via Curve’s governance process.

![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/21477469e7d025cafd72614e98c3e6cd4e3236cf.png)

The veCRV position will then be used to vote for CRV incentives to be allocated to the Aave and sAave pools via the respective gauges. Based on the CVX strategy discussed prior, these veCRV votes are likely to be allocated to the sAave gauge.

Subject to the timeline and attaining the whitelist permission to deposit into Curve’s veCRV contract, the alternative strategy is to convert CRV to cvxCRV, then stake to earn CRV, CVX and 3crv, pulse any airdrops that go to veCRV holders. This is expected to generate 47.35% vAPY, see snippet below.

**![|602x244](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v6jyNfHVIrr7ovNveVCupxypxFTzoZfLAP3_aGSwRHVcNezLxZIPvmmLHitPMI7TzrFRm9G-SRpimpcuJqnZLX-OvJ5SUai1_2jStwPxr02Uyge60q2WDCx0dS4eU4GnwAblDACD)**

The earned CRV will be converted to cvxCRV and this will compound over time. The earned CVX will be locked to increase Aave’s voting influence and the 3crv will be exchanged for CRV, then converted to cvxCRV to further compound the strategies returns over time.

### Productive aToken Stable Strategy

The sAave and Aave strategies include depositing capital into a Curve pool and then staking the LP token on Convex to earn stkAAVE, CVX and CRV rewards. The two strategies are expected to generate around 4.07% vAPY and 6.19% vAPY before Aave’s CRV and CVX voting influences the CRV incentive derived yield.

The table below shows the allocation, how each strategy is funded, and which pool those funds are to be deposited into.

### Productive ETH Strategy

After transferring the ETH from Aave V1 RF to Aave V2 RF, the awETH is to be redeemed for ETH and the combined ETH deposited into the Curve stETH pool. The LP token steCRV is to then be deposited and staked in Convex to earn CRV, CVX and LDO incentives. The expected yield is around 6.65% vAPY.

![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/3d101f6f395bb1310f0d58031136da366e6ee838.png)

No vlCVX or veCRV voting rights will be used to attract CRV incentives on this pool as the pool does not contain any aTokens.

## Balancer Strategy

### Balancer Boosted Pool Strategy

Balancer has recently launched the first [Boosted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe?utm_source=website&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=aaveboostedpools) on Wednesday 16th December and liquidity mining incentives have already commenced generating around 13.4% vAPY at the time of writing. Using the [Stable Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42000000000000000000000063) as a guide, we expect Balancer to grow the Boosted Pool with the use of Liquidity Mining (LM) and even replace the Stable Pool in time.

The Balancer Boosted Pools earn swap fee income, LM incentives, and a new type of yield derived from unproductive capital being deposited into Aave V2 to earn yield. Llama expects the yield of the Boosted pool to exceed the Stable Pool in order to entice users to move across. Llama expects LM incentives to be the mechanism for achieving an elevated return while the pool is in its bootstrapping phase.

The strategy for Aave is to deposit an equal amount of DAI, USDC and USDT into the Boosted Pool. All BAL rewards are to be retained to accumulate governance influence.

1. **Aave sAave and Aave Strategies**: These strategies involve depositing capital into a Curve pool and then staking the LP token on Convex to earn stkAAVE, CVX, CRV, and CRV incentives derived from Aave's voting influences. The expected yield is around 4.07% vAPY (Aave) and 6.19% vAPY (Aave sAave).

2. **ETH Strategy**: After transferring ETH from Aave V1 RF to Aave V2 RF, the awETH is redeemed for ETH and deposited into the Curve stETH pool. The LP token steCRV is then deposited and staked in Convex to earn CRV, CVX, and LDO incentives. The expected yield is around 6.65% vAPY.

3. **Balancer Strategy - Balancer Boosted Pool Strategy**: This strategy involves depositing an equal amount of DAI, USDC, and USDT into the Balancer Boosted Pool. The BAL rewards are to be retained to accumulate governance influence. The pool earns swap fee income, Liquidity Mining (LM) incentives, and a new type of yield derived from unproductive capital being deposited into Aave V2 to earn yield. The expected yield is around 13.4% vAPY at the time of writing.

The Balancer Boosted Pools are expected to exceed the Stable Pool in yield to entice users to move across, with LM incentives being the mechanism for achieving an elevated return while the pool is in its bootstrapping phase. No vlCVX or veCRV voting rights will be used in the ETH strategy as the pool does not contain any aTokens.

Technical Documentation: Bridging Bitcoin To Avalanche: A Technical Overview | by Michael Kaplan | Avalanche | Jun, 2022 | Medium
Support Documentation: Avalanche Bridge | Avalanche Support

## Summary

This is a proposal to list BTC.b as a collateral asset. BTC.b is the bridged version of Bitcoin from the Avalanche Bitcoin bridge.

## Motivation

The Avalanche Bridge has become a cornerstone piece of infrastructure for the Avalanche community, introducing an innovative security model that uses Intel SGX technology to usher in a new era of bridge technology. The Bitcoin bridge will allow users to directly on and off-ramp from the Bitcoin network and enable Bitcoin users the chance to participate in DeFi. It is a seamless, easy and secure process.

## Driving Factors

Secure: the bridge must be audited and built with security-first technologies.
Cost-Effective: the cost of bridging assets should be low.
Fast: the transaction should take the least amount of time possible.
Transparent: users should be informed of the transfer status at every step of the process.
Intuitive: users new to crypto asset transfers can easily understand the steps to use the bridge.
Specifications

### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
The author of the AIP is a representative of the Ava Labs team.

### Provide a high-level overview of the project and the token

Ava Labs is the servicing firm behind the Avalanche blockchain. Avalanche is a network that is EVM compatible and can scale both vertically and horizontally through the subnet architecture and rollups. Avalanche subnets can also support custom virtual machines and many programming languages.

BTC.b is the Avalanche bridged version of native Bitcoin and is non-custodial and permissionless allowing for one of the best and easiest on/off ramps to the Bitcoin network.

### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good asset to borrow or use as collateral?

BTC.b is redeemable for the native version of BTC and might be the quickest, easiest and safest way to get BTC on-chain. As we have seen in recent times CeFi carries its own risks and BTC.b allows another avenue to get BTC on-chain.

BTC.b is already integrated into multiple DeFi protocols within the Avalanche ecosystem such as Trader Joe, Platypus Finance, Pangolin, Benqi, and Paraswap.

### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Avalanche’s primary network consisting of its X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain went live a little over a year ago with on-chain protocols launching around that time and since then has not had any downtime. C-Chain is an EVM-compatible contract chain and Avalanche subnets allow for horizontal scaling into a variety of virtual machines and languages.

The Avalanche Ethereum Bridge is the most popular Ethereum bridge in terms of TVL and the network has become very popular for DeFi, peaking at 2nd or 3rd in terms of TVL only behind Ethereum. Avalanche initially struggled to gain liquidity and traction but Avalanche Rush, Avalanche’s liquidity mining program that took place in the Autumn of 2021, attracted both Ethereum bluechip protocols and thousands of new users. Avalanche also has native stablecoins ensuring some of the bridge risks are taken away.

### How is the asset currently used?

Currently, there is about $28M worth of BTC.b bridged to Avalanche C-Chain. Some of the top protocols with BTC.b integrated include $30M of liquidity deposited in Platypus Finance, the Avalanche native stableswap, $2.6M of liquidity within the Benqi lending protocol, and $14M of liquidity for the AVAX-BTC.b pair within the AMM Trader Joe.

### Emission schedule
No emission schedule

### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

The bridge uses Intel SGX with a total of 8 wardens and the approval structure of 6 of 8. The wardens include Ankr, Blockdaemon, Chainstack, Protofire, Avascan, Ava Labs, Bware Labs, and Halborn. BTC bridging with Avalanche Bridge is not supported with Metamask or any other wallet other than the Avalanche Core Wallet. This is because the Core Wallet Extension was custom built to support Bitcoin and the Avalanche Bridge and to handle the technical problems of linking Bitcoin and EVM chains within a wallet.

### How It Works/Technical Specifications

The Bridge can be broken down into two main parts: the SGX application and a set of third-party indexers and verifiers called “Wardens.” The Wardens are responsible for indexing the Avalanche and Bitcoin blockchains and submitting eligible transactions to the enclave for processing. The SGX application requires 3 of 4 Wardens to submit the same transaction before generating the signed transaction to process the Bridge transfer on the other network. For security reasons, neither the enclave nor the Wardens are directly accessible to bridge users. Instead, they’ll explicitly whitelist each other’s IP addresses for direct communication. In addition, all communication between the Enclave and Wardens will be encrypted and verified using TLS and include an HMAC signature. For relaying information to the Bridge user base, each warden hosts a JSON file containing the current bridge settings, assets requirements, and attestation report. The front end is set to disable itself if there’s any discrepancy within the critical information.

### Proposed Technical Parameters

BTC.b is proposed to start with a 70 percent max LTV, a 75 percent liquidation threshold, and a 6.5 percent liquidation penalty. With the level of on-chain liquidity and the ability to bridge from BTC.b back to native BTC quickly and exchange on centralized exchanges for native Avalanche stablecoins, these parameters are safe.",bullish,81.1,2022-07-26 13:15:05+00:00,95.7,95.7,2022-07-27 00:00:00+00:00,18.00246609124538,97.6,0.2034525277435265,0.895719438791275,True," The text presents a proposal to list BTC.b as a collateral asset on the Avalanche V3 Market.

Title: [ARFC] Repay Excess CRV Debt on Ethereum v2
Author: @llamaxyz - @MatthewGraham 
Dated: 2022-12-08

---

# Simple Summary

This publication proposes sourcing CRV for the purpose of repaying the excess debt in the CRV Reserve on the Ethereum v2 liquidity pool.

# Abstract

There are approximately 2,656,335 units of CRV of excessive debt in the Ethereum v2 CRV Reserve. At 66.35 cents per unit, a total of 1,762,478.27 USD, in the form of CRV tokens, is required to recapitalise the protocol. 

To recapitalise the protocol, Llama proposes acquiring the full amount of CRV required to repay the excess debt from the existing USDC and aUSDC holdings.

Aave currently holds 6M units of aUSDC and 358.7k units of USDC in the Ethereum Collector Contract.

# Motivation

Decide on a path forward to repay the excess debt in the CRV market (currently ~$1.76M USD, dependent on CRV's token price). Llama proposes using funds held in the Aave v2 Collector Contract to repay the excess debt. As the excess debt must be paid in CRV tokens, Aave is required to acquire 2,152,041 units of CRV.

There is currently an active proposal whereby Gauntlet's insolvency fund (valued at around $280k) is to be transferred to the Economic Reserve. The insolvency fund only offsets a portion of the total cost incurred by Aave. There has been no indication of support from the community for using AAVE held within the Safety Module or from the Ecosystem Reserve to recapitalise the protocol. If Aave was to sell AAVE or stkAAVE to fund the CRV acquisition, there are two non exclusive ways of doing this:

1) Auction via the shortfall event
2) Swap contract where anyone can swap AAVE or stkAAVE for CRV

Option 2 eliminates the need for negotiating any terms with a counterparty, or any counterparty needing to review contracts prior to interacting with a whitelisted contract. It is worth noting the Collector Contract holds insufficient AAVE or stkAAVE to support using AAVE <> CRV swaps. Any swap contract of this nature requires using the Economic Reserve. General discussion to date has indicated little appetite to sell AAVE to fund excessive debt.  

There has been some interest from the community to use the aCRV holding, currently 504,294 units, in the Ethereum Collector Contract to partially recapitalise the protocol. This is a partial solution  that is equivalent to just 18.98% ($334.6k) of the required CRV size needed. If the community was to use the aCRV position, a further 1,647,747 units of CRV are to be acquired.

With the launch of a new aToken, expected soon, Curve liquidity tokens can be deposited into Aave and still receive CRV rewards from the Curve gauges. Aave has the option to deploy the aCRV holding to veCRV and direct rewards towards Curve gauges that benefit the Aave ecosystem. This has the potential to become a meaningful income stream for Aave.

If Aave was to incur a delay in creating veCRV, historically this is one of the highest yielding reserves which is why CRV is the largest earning asset outside of the major stable coins. In more normal environments, over a 150 to 200 day period, the CRV reserve would generate sufficient yield to repay the excessive debt. This revenue source , CRV yield, would be lost if aCRV was used to fund repaying the excessive debt. Due to the potential upside, this publication supports retaining the aCRV holding.

As part of a broader consolidation of the Ethereum Collector Contract, approximately [$434.6k of assets](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-ethereum-v2-collector-contract-consolidation/10909) are to be swapped for USDC. This represents 24.7% of the funds required to recapitalise the protocol.

### Holdings Summary

| Holding          | $ Value     | % of Excessive Debt |
| --------------   | -----------          | ------------------- |
| aUSDC            | 6,002,226.07|              340.56      |
| USDC             | 358,701.07  |                20.35      |
| v2 Consolidation | 434,570.98  |           24.70      |
| aCRV             | 330,834.02  |                18.98     |
| Excessive Debt   | 1,762,478.27|          100       |

The table shows there is in total 385.61% more USDC relative to the excessive debt value. Do note this is only the USDC portion of the Collector Contract. There is also large DAI ($4,684,700.46) and USDT ($3,915,311.69) holdings.

Due to the relative size of the USDC and the upside potential to the new aToken developed by Aave Companies, Llama suggests the community utilise the USDC and aUSDC holdings to acquire the full amount of CRV needed to recapitalise the protocol.

# Specification

Deploy a swap contract exchanging USDC and aUSDC for CRV. 

The exchange rate is the Chainlink CRV/USD Oracle + 10 bps.

CRV/USD Oracle: `0xCd627aA160A6fA45Eb793D19Ef54f5062F20f33f`

Estimated Premium: 1,762,478.27 * 0.0010 = $1,762.48
A $15,000 swap via ParaSwap at 14 gwei + depositing into the swap contract is estimated to cost $12 - $15, 10 bps is $15.

A cap of $2M will be placed on swap contract. This is a defined ceiling which limits the amount of funds allocated for acquiring CRV on market. This essentially creates an upper price bound on the CRV price of 75.29 cents, which is a 13% above the current spot price, 66.35 cents. 

The actor interacting with the swap contract will have the ability to select USDC and aUSDC by choosing true or false respectively.

To repay the excess debt, the repay function will be used. This function requires CRV as an input and the address the bad debt has accumulated within.

pool.repay(crv, total bad debt, variableInterest, Address)

CRV: `ethereum:0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52`
Total Excessive Debt: 2,656,335 units of CRV
Address: `0x57e04786e231af3343562c062e0d058f25dace9e`

# Next Steps

Discuss in the comment section the above proposal. A Snapshot will be presented for the two most popular options. At the time of writing, these appear to be:

Option 1) Use USDC to acquire CRV
Option 2) Use aCRV + USDC to acquire CRV
Option 3) Do Not Recapitalise Protocol

Option 3 gives the community the ability to not recapitalise the protocol.

If the Community was to prefer to sell AAVE, the preferred mechanism is a swap contract at the AAVE/CRV composite oracle rate. ie: AAVE/USD x USD/CRV >> AAVE/CRV There would be no premium offered such a swap. Let us know what you think in the comments.

Title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Amend Safety Module AAVE Emissions
Author: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative & @TokenLogic
Date: 2023-09-24
---

## Summary
This publication proposes reducing AAVE (Safety Incentives) distributions to the Safety Module (SM) by 30% and introducing a 90-day SM emission cycle.

## Motivation
The SM serves as the Aave Protocol’s self-protection smart contract. The Aave Protocol distributes 1,100 AAVE daily, split evenly across AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH deposits.

Future proposals shall discuss the composition and aim to improve the overall capital efficiency of the SM. However, this publication intends to reduce AAVE emissions in the immediate future, saving the DAO valuable AAVE emissions while the broader SM upgrade is being advanced. It is widely accepted within the community that Aave DAO is overpaying for AAVE and B-80BAL-20wETH deposits.

This publication proposes reducing AAVE emissions by ~30%. The revised AAVE emission is to be reduced from 1,100 AAVE/day to 770 AAVE/day. This represents a 330 AAVE/day reduction. The APR for stkAAVE holders is expected to reduce from 6.87% to 4.81%. Similarly, for the B-80BAL-20wETH deposits, yield is expected to fall from 14.35% to 10.05%.

Please note that the 80AAVE/20wETH Balancer v1 pool is to be migrated to Balancer v2 in the future. This will present the community with an opportunity to further revise the AAVE emissions. It may also occur at a time when the DAO has vlAURA and/or veBAL at its disposal.

For context, the Llama Part IV SM Upgrade suggests reducing the AAVE emission to stkAAVE holders by 75%. This is because slashing for stkAAVE is to be reduced, additional assets are to be added to the SM, and the emissions are to be redirected to those newly added assets. Since this proposal was published, stkAAVE has also gained the utility of discounted GHO borrowing rates.

Similarly, Xenophon Labs recommended doubling the slashing percentage from 30% to 60% on the stkAAVE pool and lowering emissions by 80 AAVE/day, from 550 to 470. While this publication does not propose amending the slashing rate, the reduction in AAVE emissions is about double.

## Specification
The implementation for this proposal will be prepared by ACI. The table below shows the current and proposed daily AAVE Emissions.

| Collateral           | Current Emissions | Proposed Emissions |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| AAVE                 | 550               | 385                |

Summary:

This ARC presents the community with the opportunity to add rETH to the Ethereum V3 market as a reserve.

Motivation

The stETH Reserve on Aave V2 is the largest Reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.47B in deposits, exceeding ETH ($1.33B) and USDC ($885M). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximizing strategy The demand for stETH has increased as a result of listing stETH on Aave V2, which has increased the revenue of both Aave & Lido protocols while increasing liquidity & stability of stETH.

LSDs (liquid staking derivative) assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets.

Onboarding LSDs is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience.

Aave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization.

Rocket Pool is a prime candidate to add diversity to Aave, being the second most liquid LSD asset in the ecosystem.

Specification
1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

The Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Rocket Pool to push this proposal.
Increasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform.

The ACI received support from the rocket pool team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer rETH-related questions.

the ACI took inspiration from @Marceau previous ARC attempt work 5 and updated data & did edits

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?

Rocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol with permissionless Node Operators.
Rocket Pool provides a liquid staking experience for Ethereum stakers; they do not need to run a validator, and they can contribute any amount of ETH
rETH is a LSD token representing staked ETH.
The rETH liquid staking token accumulates value against ETH over time.
Simply swapping ETH for rETH (or buying it on a secondary market) provides access to Ethereum staking rewards.
Without a stake pool service, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions.
Rocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service which lowers the collateral threshold.
Abstracting staked ETH as rETH participants are able to retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership).
3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

rETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Rocket Pool node operators… Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, rETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value.
rETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens.
rETH is a good long term holding collateral but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans.
rETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave.
rETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave.
4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Rocket Pool has been active in the Ethereum community for over 5 years.
The Rocket Pool protocol went live on 9th November 2021. It was a staged rollout with full unlimited opening on 22 November 2021.
rETH supply has grown to 176k rETH backed by 185.6k ETH 2
The Rocket Pool protocol has a two DAO structure. More information on the Rocket Pool DAOs can be found here: Rocket Pool — Staking Protocol Part 2 | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium 2
5. How is the rETH token currently used?

Balancer LP of rETH/wETH 6 is the current primary use case of rETH with a liquidity of $53M

Uniswap V3 is second with $4.57M of liquidity

rETH is also used as collateral on makerDAO to mint DAI

1231×203 17.2 KB
It’s likely a Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of rETH holding.

See the community-maintained Defi Opportunities 7 document for additional use cases.

6. Emission schedule

There is no emission schedule.

rETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.

7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

rETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.

The Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities.
8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

Market capitalisation: $287 118 738
24H Volume ~$3.75M
Decentralized exchange liquidity pools

Risk Analysis
A comprehensive risk analysis has been conducted by the Maker DAO risk team here is their report:

[rETH] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation 9

Risk parameters
The Following Risk parameters are the result of Chaos Labs & Gauntlet risk teams joint work.

As such, we recommend the following parameters:

Isolation Mode - No

While isolation mode provides newer, untested assets a safe backdrop to evolve, by only allowing stablecoin borrowing, in the context of rETH however, it excludes potentially the largest use case of rETH collateral, which is to borrow correlated assets in WETH or wstETH. Enabling in isolation mode will likely not capture how rETH collateral will likely be used, and as a result, only delays the path towards understanding rETH dynamics on the Aave markets. Unless the definition of Isolation Mode includes correlated assets to rETH, we recommend against initializing in isolation mode.

Borrowable - Yes

We are aware of the risk that comes with enabling small LSD borrowing. However, disabling borrowing for rETH (given the profile shown above) may be excessive and misses out on likely use cases for rETH. As demand for liquidity for liquid staking derivatives increases, disabling borrowing cuts off a potential revenue opportunity for Aave v3 - specifically WETH/wstETH supply + rETH borrowing. We believe a better way to balance this intrinsic risk and opportunity would be to allow borrowing rETH, thus giving the protocol an opportunity to explore this potential form of usage but mitigate tail risks via stringent borrow caps. This will allow rETH more time to evolve in the context of Aave’s markets.

LT - 74%; LTV 67%

We recommend lower parameters compared to wstETH of 79.5% to capture this difference in collateral quality that we’ve identified above.

LB - 7.5%

We recommend initializing with an LB of 7.5% to give liquidators slightly more incentive to liquidate rETH collateral, as compared to wstETH.

RF - 15%

LPF - 0.1

Debt Ceiling - NA

Supply Cap - 10K

Borrow Cap - 1200

Our analysis shows that initializing rETH with borrows enabled but with a stringent borrow cap - would be most beneficial to see how rETH evolves on the v3 markets.

| Symbol | Isolation Mode | Borrowable | Collateral Enabled | LTV | LT | LB | RF | LPF | Debt Ceiling | Supply Cap | Borrow Cap |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --- | -- | -- | -- | --- | ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| rETH   | NO             | YES        | YES                | 67% | 74%| 7.5%| 15%| 0.10| N/A         | 10K       | 1200      |


## Interest Rate Curve and Reserve Factor

rETH is similar to stETH, which has been listed on Ethereum v2 since last Spring, but since borrowing has always been disabled for stETH, we have no data about how users respond to changes in interest rates. As such, we recommend starting with conservative parameters that can be optimized later.

Parameter | Recommendation
--------- | -------------
Base | 0
Slope 1 | 0.07
Uoptimal | 0.45
Slope 2 | 3.0
Reserve Factor | 0.15

Under these parameters, the borrower interest rate increases linearly from 0% at 0% utilization to 7% at 45% utilization, and then linearly to 307% at 100% utilization. This interest rate curve matches that of the more volatile assets on Aave (1INCH, CRV, ENS, LINK, MKR, UNI). From a risk perspective, interest rate curves need to be designed to reduce the chances of utilization reaching 100%, which would prevent stakers from withdrawing rETH and prevent liquidators from seizing rETH collateral when performing liquidations. The proposed interest rate curve is thus desirable because it uses a low optimal utilization and has a high maximum interest rate.",bullish,81.2,2023-01-30 12:45:20+00:00,93.4,93.4,2023-02-02 00:00:00+00:00,15.02463054187192,85.6,0.0541871921182264,0.8814346790313721,True," In this report, the Maker DAO risk team evaluates the parameters for [rETH] collateral onboarding on Aave v3 markets. Here's a summary of their recommendations:

- Isolation Mode: No (as it excludes potential use cases and delays understanding rETH dynamics)
- Borrowable: Yes (to explore potential usage while mitigating risks with stringent borrow caps)
- LTV (Liquidation Threshold): 67%
- LT (Liquidation Tolerance): 74%
- LB (Liquidation Bonus): 7.5%
- RF (Reserve Factor): 15%
- LPF (Liquidation Penalty Factor): 0.1
- Debt Ceiling: Not Applicable (NA)
- Supply Cap: 10K
- Borrow Cap: 1200

The team also recommends starting with conservative Interest Rate Curve and Reserve Factor parameters for rETH, similar to stETH on Ethereum v2. The proposed parameters are:

- Base: 0
- Slope 1: 0.07
- Uoptimal: 0.45
- Slope 2: 3.0
- Reserve Factor: 0.15

These parameters create an interest rate curve that increases linearly from 0% to 7% at 45% utilization, and then linearly to 307% at 100% utilization. This design aims to reduce the chances of utilization reaching 100%, preventing stakers from withdrawing rETH and liquidators from seizing collateral during liquidations.",bullish,medium

Author: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative

Date: 2023-03-17

## **Simple Summary**

This Temperature Check proposes the offboarding of Aave V1 by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on the platform, encouraging users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3.

## **Background**

Aave V1 has been frozen since December 2022, and users have been given ample time to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3. As sufficient time has passed, it is now appropriate to move forward with the offboarding process for Aave V1.

## **Motivation**

Aave V1 has served as a pioneering platform in the DeFi ecosystem. However, with the release of Aave V2 and Aave V3, it is essential to shift users and resources towards these more advanced and efficient platforms. By offboarding Aave V1 and encouraging migration to newer versions, we can ensure a more streamlined user experience and concentrate resources on continued development and improvements in the Aave ecosystem.

## **Specification**

The offboarding plan will be executed by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on Aave V1. These rate strategies aim to incentivize users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3 by making borrowing and supplying less attractive on Aave V1. The new rate strategies will be applied to all assets listed on Aave V1.

### **New Rate Strategies**

For each asset listed on Aave V1, new proposed values for the following parameters will be implemented:

1. uOptimal: 20%
2. reserveFactor: 99.9%
3. base rate: 3%
4. slope 1: 7%
5. slope 2: 200%

These changes will make borrowing and supplying assets on Aave V1 less attractive compared to Aave V2 or Aave V3, encouraging users to migrate their assets to the newer platforms.

## **Next Steps**

1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal.
2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion and finalization of the proposal.
3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.

Aave Companies is proposing to the DAO the introduction of GHO, which was outlined in this initial proposal. 

 
With community approval, GHO can be launched on the Aave Protocol, allowing users to mint GHO against their supplied collaterals.   
  
GHO can be minted by users against a diversified set of crypto-assets. Borrowers of GHO will continue earning interest on the underlying supplied collateral, just as in all other borrow transactions on the Aave Protocol.   
  

If approved, the introduction of GHO will provide benefits for the community via the AaveDAO by sending 100% of interest payments on GHO borrows to the DAO.  
  

If approved and implemented through an AIP, GHO will be administered by Aave governance.  
 
It will be up to the AaveDAO to decide whether they are willing to support Aave Companies for the costs and work associated with GHO. 
 
## Community Feedback 
 
The community was very engaged with the GHO proposal, providing incredibly helpful and informative feedback. 
 

Some of the most notable feedback includes (but is not limited to): 
 

- Attention to potential pitfalls around DAO-set interest rates. 

- The importance of supply caps. 

- The value that a peg stability module could bring. 

- The necessity for properly vetting potential facilitators. 

 

This snapshot, if approved, will assign the Ethereum V2 Market on the Aave Protocol as the first facilitator for GHO, whilst also greenlighting the GHO proposal more generally, allowing for audits to take place in the context of broad community approval. It will be followed by a separate proposal that outlines a proposed strong starting state for GHO, which incorporates and builds upon the aforementioned feedback while helping to ensure that GHO is community driven from the get-gho. 

  

## Snapshot  
  

This preliminary Snapshot vote serves to:  
  
- Receive community approval for the pursuit of the GHO project.  

- Whitelist the Aave V2 Ethereum Market as the first facilitator for GHO. 
- Signal community approval to kick off discussions around starting parameters.

On Aave V3, isolation mode requires multiple considerations, including mitigating tail risks to protocols, optimizing user experience, and allowing on-chain liquidity to remain robust. Here, Gauntlet provides 2 options for recommendations to mitigate the risk tradeoffs.

Full forum discussion can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-aave-v3-isolation-mode-methodology/12290).

## Methodology

We aim to isolate assets that are susceptible to infinite mint attacks, possess non-standard token functionality, or may otherwise have inherent and unpredictable risks. The debt ceiling is designed to restrict protocol exposure to price swings and potential resulting insolvencies. 

Gauntlet's methodology for isolation mode is described [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-aave-v3-isolation-mode-methodology/12290).

title: [ARFC] Treasury Management - GSM Funding & RWA Strategy Preparations
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @Sisyphos & @efecarranza 
created: 2024-01-09

---

# Summary

In preparation for launching the GHO Stability Module (GSM) and the $1M RWA strategy with Centirfuge, this publication seeks to make available the necessary amount of USDC and USDT on Ethereum v3. 

# Motivation

The GSM is in the late stages of audit and is expected to be available for deployment in the near future. The Centrifuge proposal is currently mid way through the review process. The current stable coin holdings on Ethereum are insufficient to support the GSM, RWA strategy and Service Provider (SP) commitments. Additional funds are needed on Ethereum to support the GSM. 

The [largest GSM funding requested](https://governance.aave.com/t/gho-stability-module-update/14442/10) consisted of the following:

* 3.5M USDC
* 3.5M USDT 

The RWA Strategy is valued at [1M](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-treasury-rwa-allocation/14790) of USDC funding.

The expected aEthUSDC and aEthUSDT Reserve Holding, post Aave Funding Part B being implemented, is as shown below:

* 2.93M aEthUSDC (0.72M current holding plus 2.21M Aave Funding Part B)
* 0.71M aEthUSDT (0.71M current holding)

It is clear from comparing the numbers above, there is a need to add to the aEthUSDC and aEthUSDT holdings in order to fullfill the GSM and RWA Strategy commitments.

Tapping into the aUSDT and aUSDC holdings is not enough as the current aUSDT (Aave v2) is only sufficient to cover 1 years runway and all the aUSDC will already migrated to aEthUSDC upon implementing Aave Funding Part B.

The aEthDAI reserve holds sufficient funds to cover any [ImmuneFi Bug Bounty Program](ipns://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/325/), sustain [BGDLabs stream](ipns://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/311/), support this [bug bounty](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-request-for-bounty-payout-december-2023/15826) and this [adhoc security request](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-security-budget-request-december-2023/15783). 

At the time of writing, it is only possible to move funds between the Polygon and Ethereum Treasuries via on-chain governance. The below summaries the expected Polygon Treasury holdings based upon this [migration PR](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/pull/126) being implemented.

* 2.58M aPolUSDC
* 1.53M aPolDAI
* 0.80M aPolUSDT

There is sufficient funds on Polygon to cover the immediate needs of the GHO GSM.

In addition to the above, this proposal also contains a small bit of house keeping that includes setting two legacy aUSDC Allowances to zero. Whilst the funds mentioned can not be claimed, they are currently showing as available when querying the Allowance ([10.](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBcca60bB61934080951369a648Fb03DF4F96263C#readProxyContract)) balance.

The London Business School (LBS) Blockchain Society, in alliance with Flipside Governance (@fig), FranklinDAO (@PennBlockchain), the University of Michigan (@Michigan_Blockchain), and Columbia University (@BlockchainAtColumbia), proposes to institute a gas fee rebate mechanism for recognised delegates voting on-chain on Aave.

## ***Motivation***

Gas fees on Ethereum have been increasing recently. As shown by data from Dune Analytics, median gas prices sit at around 30 gwei, with intradaily spikes often far exceeding that level. The amount of gas fees required for voting on-chain has therefore risen proportionally, increasing the cost of on-chain governance for delegates (particularly in light of the heavier recent proposal load at Aave).

**![|537x363](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oDESh98-zthvbro3LnZuiQcCRWRRqMXRcC_HzQNnbdKmKLZ40BN5_Zes9fmVp2kg7tMLV7uAmJKMqHvl-IAH45Ycf17xD-XRzrphEo_oUpREx-AtZYZ6cg0IRjiRB7AjKMPVI9bfyfHxjtr2ybCclrE)**

To find out more about gas costs on Aave, refer to the following dashboards created by Flipside here:

* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/janan/aave-delegates-rayk2E
* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/alitaslimi/aave-delegates-gas-usage-9LderL

* https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/panda-gXSkiX/aave-gas-usage-on-votes-_zF8ba

LBS Blockchain Society, like other peer universities, is a not-for-profit, student-run organisation that depends on sponsorships and stipends to finance its operations. We currently receive monthly compensation for participating in MakerDAO governance, but otherwise receive no other form or income. Other schools like FranklinDAO (Penn Blockchain) are in very similar states. So far, we have been using this to cover gas costs at Aave, but the cost of on-chain governance remains a growing concern for us.

In light of this, we see rebating delegates for their participation as having the following benefits:

* Incentivise more active engagement of the delegate community by removing the disincentive to vote. Broader participation leads to better decision-making for Aave.
* Create a more diverse voter base that includes student organisations such as ours. Reducing the barrier to entry for voting creates a more open, collaborative delegate ecosystem. This in turn drives participation.
* Retain the best delegates to drive growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being a great Aave delegate should not be at a net cost to the delegate with regards to spending ever-increasing gas costs.
* Achievable at relatively low cost. We also outline measures to reduce the administrative burden for Aave below.

## ***Specification***

*Participation Criteria*

To incentivise maximal voter participation, we propose a participation-based rebate system. Participation is defined by the proportion of proposals, being the sum total of Snapshot polls and AIPs, voted on by a Recognized Delegate over the lesser of: 1) the previous 90 days, or 2) since becoming a Recognized Delegate. A Participation score of 100% would mean that a Delegate has voted on all polls and AIPs over this period. Moreover, only delegate platforms with 10k+ AAVE in voting power will be eligible for gas fee rebates, in order to avoid spam - the 10k is a small enough number to allow for enough delegate participation but filters out any spam.

*Note*: A Recognized Delegate is one with an Aave Delegate Platform, such as the LBS Blockchain Society, University of Michigan, FranklinDAO, Flipside, Llama, Aave Chan Initiative, Stablelabs, etc. The list of Recognized Delegates is open to change over time. A list of Aave Delegate Platforms can be found here, but note that there are a few new platforms and all of them may not have the required 10k AAVE voting power.

|Participation Rate over Previous 90 days|Gas Rebate|
| --- | --- |
|>80%|100%|
|50% to 80%|50%|
|<50%|0%|

*Claiming Process*

To reduce the administrative burden for Aave, we propose the claiming process should be initiated by Recognized Delegates themselves. Every month, Recognized Delegates have the option to submit a Gas Rebate Application to Aave, which shall include:

1. The list of transactions associated with voting on Aave proposals over that month
2. The corresponding gas fees spent on each transaction
3. Etherscan links detailing the above

Delegates can also choose to batch their Gas Rebate Applications (i.e. submit a single application for multiple months). However, any gas fees not claimed over a 12 month period will be automatically forfeited.

Once an application has been submitted to Aave, an appointed Governance Facilitator will review the applications and submit an AIP to pay out the gas fees. To that end, we have created a Dune dashboard that the Governance Facilitator can use to calculate the gas costs paid by a specific address, i.e., the address used by delegates to vote. The dashboard can be found [here](https://dune.com/parkyeung/aave-governance-voting-gas-costs). Initially, we propose that the Aave Chan Initiative plays the role of Governance Facilitator.

To calculate the participation rate for delegates, we recommend using the following formula:

*Number of Proposals Voted on Since First Vote / Total Number of Proposals Since First Vote*

For example, assume a Delegate Platform’s first vote was on Jan 1 2023. If they apply for a gas rebate on Feb 1 2023, and there have been 20 proposals between Jan 1 and Feb 1, out of which the Delegate has voted for 17 proposals, their participation rate is 85%.

We are working to publish a tool to easily calculate participation rate for the Governance Facilitator and will update this post once it is ready.

We propose the funds to be paid from the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract, but defer to the community for guidance on the most appropriate source of funds.

*Gas Rebate Token*

We consider two options for the Gas Rebate Token: 1) ETH, the native asset in which gas fees are paid, and 2) stablecoins (e.g. USDC, DAI).

The list of holdings in the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c#assets-wallet).

Each option above has associated trade-offs (for example certain assets may be deemed more strategic than others, or represent larger existing holdings). We would welcome community feedback on the most appropriate asset in advance of voting.

352,580,1282,1282,1282,2024-04-15 14:28:50+00:00,aave,"## Summary

A proposal to increase OP’s liquidation threshold and LTV on Aave V3 Optimism.

## Motivation

OP is currently configured with a liquidation threshold (LT) of 40% and max loan-to-value (LTV) of 30%. These parameters were intentionally [set](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-op-as-collateral-to-aave-v3/9087/18) conservatively and in isolation mode, when the asset was first listed to ensure mechanisms were working as intended. In [October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/337/), OP was removed from isolation mode. Following our observations, we believe it prudent to increase the LT and LTV for OP.

OP's average market cap over the past 180 days is $1.78BN, and its daily average volume is $192M.

It has registered a daily annualized volatility of 98.53%, a 30-day annualized volatility of 92.6%, and its largest single-day price drop was 17.7%.

3.7M of the 7.4M OP supplied is supplied by a single [user](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x790c9422839fd93a3a4e31e531f96cc87f397c00), who also maintains large positions on Arbitrum and Ethereum. Their last deposit on Optimism was 252K OP on March 12; they repaid $1M USDT on April 6 and currently hold a health score of 2.02.

The majority of assets borrowed against OP collateral are stablecoins. That puts these positions at risk of liquidation in the event OP’s price moves falls.
However, collateral at risk does not exceed $100K until OP’s price falls to $2.13, a 35% drop from current levels.

Given these observations, we recommend first aligning OP’s parameters with ARB’s on Arbitrum (50% LTV and 60% LT), an asset with a similar supply distribution and liquidity profile. Following observations at these levels and utilizing our simulation platform, these parameters may be further optimized.

## Specification

| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Recommended LTV | Current LT | Recommended LT |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Optimism | OP | 30.00% | 50.00% | 40.00% | 60.00% |

# Next Steps

We invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and, barring community objection, will follow up with a Snapshot vote in five days.

As part of our ongoing deprecation process, we propose the following measures designed to motivate the repayment of borrowed assets and the redemption of supplied assets:

### Increase Reserve Factors:

In order to further disincentivize the supply of the assets being deprecated, this proposal recommends setting the RFs of all frozen assets on V2 Ethereum to near 100%. This change will effectively remove any yield for depositors of these assets, thereby discouraging their supply.

### Increase Borrow Rates:

To encourage the repayment of borrowed assets, we propose raising the borrow rates across V2 frozen assets. This will be achieved by creating a constant borrow rate up to the currently set UOptomal configuration. Accordingly, we put forward the following options for the community to choose from:

**Moderate (Chaos Recommendation):**

1. Set Base Rate at 20%
2. Set Slope1 at 0%
3. Set Slope2 at 300%

**Aggressive:**

1. Set Base Rate at 40%
2. Set Slope1 at 0%
3. Set Slope2 at 300%

After these changes are put into effect, we'll evaluate their influence on loan repayments and, if necessary, offer additional recommendations. Future updates could involve further hikes in borrow rates and adjustments to the UOptimal points.

A proposal to adjust four (4) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across two (2) Aave V3 Avalanche assets.

## Motivation
Chaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different configurations of Aave V3 risk parameters would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt.

*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the search range to ±3% change for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters in cases the optimal configuration is outside this range.*

Please find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).

You can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).

#### Increase LTs + LTVs (WAVAX and LINK.e)
The output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WAVAX and LINK.e, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a minor effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)

## Summary
This publication presents the community an opportunity to add gmETH on the Arbitrum Aave v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Motivation
GMX Protocol is the largest DEX offering derivatives and one of the most popular DeFi’s today. The introduction of several new features and integration with Chainlink Data Stream in GMX V2 has significantly reduced the risks of front-running and price manipulation compared to GMX V1. gmETH is a ETH-USD's Liquidity Token on the GMX V2 and earn fees from leverage trading, borrowing fees and swaps. 

Integrating gmETH as collateral asset in the Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool has the potential to create new demand for borrowable assets on Aave V3.

## Specification

Author: Stargate

Date: 2023-03-24

## Proposal

Stargate is a fully composable liquidity transport protocol that lives at the heart of DeFi. Users can utilize Stargate to transfer value between various supported blockchains taking advantage of guaranteed finality for their transfers, low fees and deep liquidity. Developers can enable omnichain experiences within their products by utilizing Stargate’s deep liquidity and easy composability.

Stargate operates using only native assets across each of the eight chains it supports (Ethereum, Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Fantom and Metis). Users will always receive native assets when interacting with Stargate, getting rid of the need for wrapped assets or IOUs of value. Stargate has helped facilitate over $4,500,000,000 of value transferred by over 1,000,000 transactions within the first year since launch.

Portals are an ideal fit for Stargate as it combines one of the most used and liquid third party bridges that has a strong track record of moving value with one of the most respected protocols and communities of users in Aave. Stargate would enable Aave users to reliably and safely access assets on a variety of chains in a secure and trusted manner.

Stargate would like to request a credit line for USDC, USDT and ETH to help Aave users access these assets in a multi-chain world.

## Technical Specifications
Stargate operates with deep pools of capital on each chain it resides on. Currently there is over $325,000,000 of value within Stargate that facilitates hundreds of millions of dollars of monthly volume and tens of thousands of monthly users. Over its lifetime, Stargate has helped over 1,000,000 users move over $4,500,000,000 of value and growing.

These pools of capital allow users and developers to move value between supported chains in a predictable and reliable way. When this is combined with Stargate’s Instant Guaranteed Finality 1 it means that a transfer always completes on the destination chain with the intended amount. There is never a case where you get wrapped tokens or some notional representation of value. This is incredibly important for Portals as it guarantees that all unbacked aTokens will be repaid in a predictable and guaranteed way.

To support portals, a user would simply have to deposit a supported asset (USDC, USDT or ETH) and select the destination chain where they want to receive the asset from Aave. Stargate would then use a LayerZero message to release the asset on the destination chain from Aave, giving it to the requesting user. At the same time the underlying native asset would be simultaneously bridged via Stargate’s traditional, battle tested liquidity transfer mechanism based on the pools of capital within the protocol. When this transfer completes, the native assets would be used to repay the outstanding debt from the Aave aTokens Stargate was lent to facilitate the transfer. 

![c8c39318ca95bad03b284bbc5d0686e501feefd4_2_1035x369.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreidceffrxyjlnke5g5llx4qligsusifjopa4dzwdbry2dy6xljqmti)
    
Stargate is built on top of LayerZero. LayerZero is a lightweight universal messaging interface that allows developers to seamlessly interact with contracts across dozens of blockchains. LayerZero Endpoints rely on an innovative architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and independent Oracles and Relayers to securely relay messages between chains.

 
![8f67c0c0d823a501d5e7a1d73a1f6f674c84eb20_2_1035x415.png](ipfs://bafkreig3qzjidrciod6le7ttgiob4xaf5l3c6pt7xahy35gajps4vrznlu)
*Communication flow in a single LayerZero cross-chain transaction.*

In a single call, paying only source gas, users and protocols can send a message (or a bundle of messages) to contracts on any supported chain. Stargate uses this messaging to facilitate the movement of value (stable coins, ETH and other assets) between the eight chains it supports. These chains are Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Fantom, Polygon, Avalanche and Metis.

* Can anyone provide liquidity to the protocol?

Yes

* Is liquidity incentivized?

Partially, Stargate owns a portion of the liquidity within the protocol, providing predictable, evergreen underlying liquidity to the protocol and incentivizes the remaining liquidity

* Is there a fee model for participants?

Stargate currently charges 6 basis points per transfer plus the cost of the gas associated with sending the transaction through the LayerZero network

* Does the entity is or is planning to provide available liquidity into Aave protocol?

Stargate currently is exploring research ideas around depositing idle liquidity into Aave

## Credit Line Request
Stargate would like to request credit lines for the blockchains where both it and Aave exist. These are Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, and Fantom. We understand Portals will start primarily between ETH and the layer 2 ecosystems (Arbitrum and Optimism) so would like to request credit lines there first, with the ability to scale to the other chains as Aave scales Portals. This way Stargate can grow with Aave as a partner.

|Network|Asset|Current Liquidity (USD)|Current 30D volume (USD)|Requested credit Line|Fee Model|Fee requested|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|All|USDC|90.2M|242M|1M per chain|Fixed|6 bps|
|All|USDT|54.3M|100M|1M per chain|Fixed|6 bps|
|All|ETH|22.7M|68M|1M per chain|Fixed|6 bps|

## Incentives
An incentive program may be approved by the Stargate DAO after the proposal is approved. The Stargate Foundation will recommend that the Stargate DAO give 2 bps of every transaction to the Aave DAO to help align economic incentives and create a deeper partnership between the two communities.

## Audits & Security
* List of relevant security audits of the network

Stargate both internally and externally audits all code that is shipped for the protocol. Stargate works with external auditors like Zellic, Ottersec, and Ackee to ensure user funds are always safe.

A list of audits can be found here: https://github.com/stargate-protocol/stargate/tree/main/audit

Stargate also utilizes LayerZero’s PreCrime solution to ensure that it never loses a single unit of user funds. Pre-Crime takes an outbound transaction and makes sure that it’s legitimate by running it against a set of application-defined invariants before the delivery of each message. Pre-Crime first forks every chain locally then it runs the state transaction locally to make sure the resulting state meets the list of defined invariants the application sets. Once this is confirmed Pre-Crime then provides an attestation that this is a legitimate transfer and the message is delivered.

Title: [ARC] ETH Interest Rate Curve Update
Author: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @Dydymoon 
Dated: 2022-11-05

---

# Simple Summary

@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend ETH interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2 and Ethereum v3 (when deployed) Liquidity Pools.

# Abstract

With Aave v3 about to be deployed on Ethereum and a wstETH and ETH eMode likely, the ETH Interest Rate should be adjusted such that the looped recursive strategy breaks even within Slope 1 where the Interest Rate changes are less volatile.

The new interest rate curve has an Interest Rate of 5.75% at the Uoptimal point, which is 25 bps more than stETH yield at the time of writing. This proposal will lead to improved capital efficiency of the ETH Reserve and generate more revenue for the DAO when compared to just replicating the v2 Interest Rate curve on v3 with the introduction of an ETH eMode Category.

For the existing v2 market, @llamaxyz suggests adopting the same Interest Rate parameters as being proposed on v3. This will enable the ETH yields across the markets to somewhat equalize leading to higher utilization of the ETH Reserve and more revenue for the DAO.

# Motivation

By changing the Interest Rate at the Uopotimal point from 3% to 5.75%, when an eMode for ETH and wstETH is created on Aave v3 the recursive strategy will break even prior to reaching the Uoptimal utilization within the Reserve. This is a desirable feature as the volatility of the Interest Rate on Slope 1 is less than Slope 2. By setting the Slope 1 parameter at 5.75%, 25 bps greater than the current annual wstETH yield, utilization in the Reserve is not expected to reach the Uoptimal level for any prolonged period of time. By reducing the Slope 2 parameter, from 100 to 80, the gradient of the second part of the yield curve increases due to an increase in Uoptimal from 70% to 80%. This is subtle and can be seen in the chart below. The Base Rate for the existing Interest Rate and proposed Interest Rate is unchanged at 0%.

With the new Interest Rate curve recommended for the v3 deployment, it is reasonable to expect the yield across the v2 and v3 deployment to be arbitraged. If the yield on the v3 deployment converges to the wstETH rate, then this will shift the v2 Reserve utilization beyond the Uoptimal level set at 3%. Because of this, it is recommended to also change the v2 Interest Rate to match the v3 deployment Interest Rate. This way both v2 and v3 Reserves will experience utilization along the Slope 1 portion of the Interest Rate curve whilst also benefiting from improved capital efficiency.

The graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.

This proposal increases the Reserve Factor from 10% to 15%, directing 15% of the interest paid to Aave DAO. When combined with the Interest Rate changes, the v2 deployment will generate an estimated $13.1k per day, up from around $5.5k per day. Prior to this proposal, due the implementation of AIP-68, the Aave DAO is earning less revenue from the ETH Reserve post merge despite utilization within the Reserve increasing significantly over that time, [2].

# Specification

The below table shows the current and proposed changes to the ETH Reserve on Ethereum v2 and Ethereum v3 when deployed.

|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Uoptimal|70|80|
|Base|0|0|
|Slope1|3.0|5.75|
|Slope2|100|80|
|Reserve Factor|10|15|

Title: [ARFC] Merit - A New Aave-Alignment User Reward System
Author: Marc Zeller - Aave Chan Initiative
Dated: 2024-02-16
---

## Summary
""Merit"" proposes a merkle-tree-based periodic airdrop system, designed to reward Aave-aligned user behaviors and enhance protocol competitiveness, with a defined budget for the initial 90-day period.

## Motivation
Addressing the competitive DeFi landscape, ""Merit"" seeks to elevate Aave's appeal and efficiency through a rewarding mechanism that prioritizes DAO-beneficial actions, distinguishing Aave from competitors employing artificial incentive methods.

## Specification

The ""Merit"" system employs a booster-based model to reward specific user actions with points, dictating the weekly StkAAVE and GHO distribution. The system incorporates merit boosters and diluters to adjust user rewards based on their alignment with Aave's objectives. The initiative starts with a budget of 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO, totaling 5M$ for a 90-day duration, focusing on direct Aave protocol engagement and promoting diversified staking strategies.

### Rewarded Actions

Actions that align with Aave's strategic objectives will be rewarded:

| Action |
| --- |
| Borrow wETH |
| Borrow GHO |

### Merit boosters

Merit boosters enhance these rewards for specific behaviors:

| Behavior | Multiplier description |
| --- | --- |
| Second-degree user of aligned protocol | booster for users coming from aligned protocols that favor Aave over other protocols. |
| Migrator | Incentive for moving positions to Aave from others protocols |
| Diversity Supporter | Rewards for using minority LSTs |
| Aavenger | usage of AAVE as collateral
| MakerDAO fren | usage of sDAI as collateral
| OG DAO Participant | Booster for early DAO voters or delegates |
| Holdooor | Booster for ≥100-day AAVE holders in the past year |
| Stakoor | Booster for ≥100-day StkAAVE holders in the past year |
| Staker | Bonus for staking AAVE, StkBPT, StkGHO |
| Active in Governance | Rewards for voting or delegating to an Aave DAO recognized delegate platform |

### Merit Diluters

Merit Diluters will dilute part or all rewards for certain behaviors:

| Behavior | Dilution Description/Effect |
| --- | --- |
| User of Non-Aligned Protocol | Severe dilution (up to -100%) |

### Non-aligned protocol list:

We propose to launch Merit with a single protocol with non-aligned status: **Morpho Aave Optimizers V2 & V3**

### Migration bonus multipliers list:

We propose to apply the “migratooor” Boosters to users leaving the following protocols to join the Aave ecosystem:

- Morpho V2
- Morpho V3
- Morpho Blue
- Spark


### Budget and Scope

- **Bi-Weekly Budget:** Defined by Aave Finance service providers, all data will be published publicly after the Merit program ends.
- **Total Budget:** **5M$ with 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO for 90 days.**
- **Scope:** Aave V3 Ethereum.

### Synergies

Numerous protocols reached out during the TEMP CHECK period to co-incentive merit; @karpatkey_TokenLogic via Aave Finance are coordinating these efforts, and their incentives are expected to be on top of the Merit budget.

## Next Steps

1. Refine the proposal details based on community feedback to achieve consensus.
2. Conduct a snapshot vote for community sentiment.
3. Following a successful snapshot outcome, escalate to the AIP stage for official voting and implementation.

## ***Simple Summary***

As Aave grows, there is a need for more advanced features that ensure the privacy and security of participants. Private voting is one such feature that would help to accomplish this goal.

Making use of [partial private voting](https://blog.shutter.network/shutter-brings-shielded-voting-to-snapshot/) within the Snapshot platform (shielded voting) will enhance Aave’s governance and voters - leading to more fair and accurate results in the Snapshot stage.

Shielded voting allows voters to hide their votes during the duration of the voting process and reveal their choices and results after the vote concludes.

We propose that the community votes to turn on the private voting module for a **two-month trial period**, which can be reverted by the community and Space administrators at any time.

This allows Aave to judge the efficacy of shielded voting in Snapshot and serve as a leader for Governance in other DAOs in adapting, experimenting, and innovating with new mechanisms.

## ***Motivation***

Aave Governance features both on-chain and off-chain voting. In the signal stage, Snapshot, votes have become decided by a few voters without many diversions.

After speaking with other delegates, we recognize these outcomes and votes may not always reflect the true wishes of the community; it has become political. An example from Shutter’s blog of how the current process could be political, is below:

Consider a contentious vote in which a minority is pushing the poll early in one direction. Voters that don't have a strong opinion already formed might see this and think the outcome is already decided. Thus, they will be discouraged from voting and also from researching/forming an opinion. This could then lead to the vote going in favor of the minority due to voter apathy, which would not be a good outcome, given that the goal of the poll is to represent the majority opinion.

Aave’s Snapshot space must be a place for honesty and candid feedback; without these values, the space becomes redundant and leads to burnout [proposal coming soon.]

By shielding the individual votes, it encourages voters of different sizes and opinions to participate and feel empowered, leading the DAO toward a more fair outcome.

Snapshot has recently introduced Shielded voting, announced[ here](https://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o).

Shielded voting has four keys benefits:

1. Prevents voter intimidation or coercion
2. Prevent early voters' decisions from influencing the decisions of later voters, thus reduce herding behavior and encourage independent thinking.
3. Protects participants' privacy by ensuring that their voting preferences are not exposed
4. Enhances the overall security and integrity of the Snapshot platform by making it more difficult for bad actors to interfere with the voting process

A [demo](https://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o) reveals a minimal change in the Snapshot UI:

This functionality is powered by Shutter Network.

## ***Specification***

The steps for upgrading a Snapshot space to Shielded voting are as follows:

-> admin of the “Aave” space go to the settings page in the “Voting” section

-> choose Shutter as a privacy option and click “Save”

-> all proposals from then on will use shielded voting.

The community may disable this feature anytime.

The current list of Snapshot admins is as follows:

* @monetsupply
* @MarcZeller 
* 0xc8E0345596D7196941E61D3aB607E57Fe61F85E7
* 0x2357df661D0E56140dF30c3ad0b2B426fB4666e6
* 0x60C8dC4762b217b4A00FF1824111077f331B1FbF
* 0x2D0D6A8553993a3E9eD1D86415358D1EDEfa82F1

## ***Success Criteria***

The time period the below criteria will be considered over will be 2 months prior to private voting being enabled vs. 2 months from when the time it is enabled.

* Average spread between YES to NO votes
* Number of unique voters voting
* Difference between outcomes of the votes, i.e., what % of votes result in YES

For each of these criteria, success is when the average spread between YES to NO votes reduces, the number of unique voters increases, and there is greater variety in the outcome of the votes. 

These outcomes would indicate increased and more thorough engagement across the community.

This proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard ENS to the Etheruem Aave V3 Market.

# Motivation

As part of the community efforts on the V2 to V3 migration, Chaos Labs proposed a [multi-phased plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636) to promote V3 adoption. As per this plan, Chaos Labs proposes to list ENS on Aave V3 on Ethereum. ENS is currently listed on V2 Ethereum with borrow disabled.

As the proposed assets in the migration plan are traded with relatively low market cap and trading volume, we have taken a prudent approach in setting borrow caps to account for no more than 1% of the average daily trading volume. The supply cap was derived using our supply cap methodology with the V2 data (simulation results can be seen in the image below). Additionally, we have  adjusted the IR Slope1 to reflect the changes in interest rates over the past months and adjusted the liquidation bonus levels to the current liquidity levels in DEXs.

**Title:** [ARFC] Onboarding of weETH to Aave v3 on Ethereum
**Author:** Ether.fi & ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)
**Date:** 2024-02-27

---
### **Summary:**

The current ARFC seeks to add [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) Liquid Restaking Token weETH to Aave V3 Ethereum, after the successful [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboarding-weeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/16546) and [TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xffe122a2fb0b34e713b7bb8e74e943b35c6cb298bafc4e50c464b62167e3246e).

The intention behind this initiative is to enhance the diversity of assets on Aave and bolster liquidity within the ecosystem.

### Motivation:

eETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer. As of February 3rd, approximately 290,310 ETH ($670M) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi 1](http://ether.fi/) protocol, and XX has been natively restaked in EigenLayer.

[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) stands as the pioneering decentralized and non-custodial delegated staking protocol featuring an LRT (eETH). A notable feature of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is the control it provides stakers over their keys. The team behind the protocol is guided by the following principles:

1. Decentralization is the foremost objective. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is unwavering in its commitment to maintain the protocol's non-custodial and decentralized nature, ensuring that stakers always have control over their ETH.
2. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) operates as a legitimate business with a sustainable revenue model, with the team dedicated to its long-term success. There is no place for deceptive or unsustainable financial practices.
3. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is committed to always acting in the best interest of the Ethereum community. In the event of any missteps, the team at [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) will take responsibility and swiftly rectify the situation.

Risks:

[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)’s LRT eETH is 100% redeemable. Users who deposit ETH into the protocol can withdraw their stake at any time. The holdings are publicly auditable on-chain and the protocol retains healthy reserves to offset any losses.

## Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:

Anyone who deposits weETH into Aave will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)  and EigenLayer points to be used for future incentives.

Users are given eETH on a 1:1 basis with a minimum deposit of 0.001 ETH. 

[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity (weETH) to various platforms.

title: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding
author: @karpatkey_TokenLogic
created: 2024-02-29

---

# Summary

This publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee with 500k GHO to continue supporting GHO's liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next 3 months.

# Motivation

Since its initial [funding in October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/343/), the Aave Liquidity Committee (previously GLC) has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes by deploying and incentivising liquidity pools.
 
As a result of these efforts:

* Deeper on-chain liquidity
* Lower slippage, especially for GHO to USDC swaps

In combination with other efforts like stkGHO, ALC's initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHO's peg recovery.

Throughout the period, the ALC leveraged on both Uniswap v3 and, more frequently, Maverick to tailor liquidity distribution at specific price ranges which helped absorb GHO downward market volatility. A list of active Boosted Positions can be found [here](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions?chain=1).

While some pools are incentivised by voting with pre-existing DAO holdings (e.g. vlAURA), others like Maverick's concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses. It is worth noting, the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick. We expect Maverick, and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3, to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience.

Concentrated GHO liquidity was [recently introduced in Balancer](https://twitter.com/GyroStable/status/1757365157917815001) with the creation of several E-CLP pools. These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAO's vlAURA holding. When there is excess vlAURA votes, these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70% APR nominated in USDC. 

The following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHO's ecosystem, highlights:

* GHO/USDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume 
    * 0.2% bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period
    * 0.1% bin width pool is starting to replace the 0.2% bin width pool trading volume. This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 0.1% bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility 
*  GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP
    *  Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by [other protocols](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Graham_/status/1762076544241955070) and leveraged farming is introduced
* Gyrsocope E-CLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks
    *  As the peg improves, one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg

The next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas:

* 1.00:1.00 peg with USD 
* Reducing price volatility
* Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations
* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools
* Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases

These efforts will need to scale to match GHO's expected growth profile. The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins, and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future, as well as participation in the launch of various projects like [Ethena](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and [f(x) Protocol's launch](https://x.com/protocol_fx/status/1762822716854354015?s=20). 

Though there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates, price volatility, and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations, we believe a high-level budget will look like the following:

| Objective | Category | Budget   |
| --------  | --------  | -------- |
| Liquidity | Peg Resilience | 360k GHO |
| DeFi Integrations  | Create Utility  |  140k GHO |
|Total| | 500k GHO|

It is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum.

# Performance Indicators

The below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking:

| Description| Optimal Value|
| --------  | --------  |
| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M |
| TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools  | 15M excl. stkGHO  |
| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |
| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap | < 0.10%  (GHO to USDC)|
| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  |
| Price level for > 90% time   | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  |

Please note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next 3 months on the assumption the Borrow Cap is continually increased beyond the current 35M Bucket Size. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.

The [stkGHO implementation](https://app.aave.com/staking), [USDe integration](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and coordinated efforts to attract users to acquire GHO are all great examples of how growth initiatives drive GHO utility, adoption and have a positive impact the spot price. 

Each of the above metrics, plus more, will be shown on the TokenLogic analytics dashboard.

# Specification

Swap the following assets for GHO:

* 250k aUSDT
* 250k aUSDC

Create an allowance for 500k GHO.

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V2 ETH.

## Abstract

Many interest rate curves on Aave have not changed for a long time and, in the case of some assets, have never been updated for the lifetime of the asset listing. Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet has evaluated assets on Aave and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. 


## Motivation

Among other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve:

1. mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool
2. build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future

Title: [TEMP CHECK] AAVE V3 Harmony Recovery ONE Proposal 

Author: [@mbarret3 & @Selvy & RecoveryONE & R1Ambassador]

Created: 2023-12-03

---

# Summary

This proposal addresses the bad debt incurred by the Aave protocol on the Harmony network due to the Horizon Bridge exploit in June 2022. It proposes a solution to remove the bad debt and compensate AAVE holders by creating a fund and allowing token exchange.

# Motivation

To gauge community sentiment regarding a proposal to offer a resolution for those affected by the June 2022 Horizon Bridge hack.

- Context: In June 2022, the Horizon Bridge hack resulted in the exploit of Harmony’s ERC Bridge, leading to a loss of approximately $100 million. This hack caused an excessive printing of assets like 1USDC and 1USDT, devaluing them significantly. Opportunists exploited this by buying these devalued assets at a discount and depositing them into Aave. Despite the devaluation, Aave maintained a 1:1 price ratio for these assets post-hack, allowing users to borrow ONE and drain it completely from the protocol. As of today, 55.42M ONE has been drained from Aave V3 Harmony, bringing the market to a standstill. So we would ask Harmony to add a fund of 5,542,000 ONE and Aave to add 5,542,000 ONE.

- Impact: Aave currently holds bad debt of approximately $751K due to this exploit. The lack of immediate action by Aave to adjust pricing variables after the hack exacerbated the issue.

# Specification

This proposal suggests bad debt removal approach

Bad Debt Removal: Create a fund 10% (5,542,000 ONE) from Harmony Recovery ONE and 10% (5,542,000 ONE) from AAVE treasury. * Use this fund so that Aave holders can withdraw their deposited tokens in exchange for 20% of their original deposit value.

Implementation: Aave DAO governance will vote on this proposal. If approved, a smart contract will be deployed to facilitate the token exchange and fund creation.
    
# Next Steps

- Get community feedback on TEMP CHECK
- Snapshot vote

# Disclaimer

This proposal is not without risk and does not guarantee a complete resolution of the bad debt issue. The Aave community is encouraged to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks before voting.

We are thrilled to present this budget proposal on behalf of Aave Companies and our ongoing commitment to support the Aave Community. This proposal will enable the Aave DAO and Aave Companies to collaborate and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem and drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption at key events like DevConnect, rAAVE, and ETHGlobal Istanbul.

# History
Aave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, and stakeholders.

Aave Companies recognizes the fundamental importance of the Aave Grants DAO in nurturing the DeFi ecosystem and has consistently provided support to the AGD through direct collaboration. Historically, Aave Companies has worked alongside AGD to bring sponsorship and presence at hackathons and events, designed and created the highly coveted Aave merch, and brought rAAVE to life in various cities across the globe.

# Overview
Aave Companies is requesting a budget allocation of $550,000 paid in GHO for the remainder of 2023 to support a range of activations and events to continue growing and nurturing the global Aave Community. These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:
1. Sponsoring Hackathons: Aave Companies intends to sponsor hackathons to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as the new stablecoin, GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2 but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem.
2. Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences allows the Aave community to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge and industry insights. These events often include panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts. Side events are also where Aave is able to show our commitment to inclusivity and diversity in the web3 ecosystem by tapping into new communities and audiences. We’re proud to be supporters of groups such as SheFi and BoysClub.
3. Merch: Aave Companies recognizes the importance of high-quality merchandise in building brand recognition. We intend to continue to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement efforts as well as to proliferate the ghost. We will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials, and creating merch people actually wear, use, and love.
4. Development of the GHO Pass: With one of the core missions of the Aave community being to grow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity, we’re excited to announce Aave Companies’ development of the GHO Pass. The GHO Pass V1 will facilitate GHO purchases at both Aave events and events we sponsor. We plan to launch GHO Pass at DevConnect, where users can get early access to a select group of rAAVE tickets and drink credits, exclusive merch, and other perks.
5. rAAVE: To celebrate and give back to the Aave community, we plan to host another edition of our vibrant and highly demanded event, rAAVE. Such events serve as an excellent opportunity for building “hype” around the Aave brand and creating a memorable experience for the Aave community. We will also explore live streaming rAAVE, and integrating GHO pass (as mentioned above). We will continue to manage ticketing logistics, press relations, as well as rAAVE social media.

# Activations
Activations continue to be a key focus and driver of growth for the Aave ecosystem thanks to:
- Creating a welcoming, engaging and memorable experience at the Aave booth.
- Sponsoring side events, hackathons, prizes and providing exceptional support to developers.
- Spreading Aave’s culture by distributing highly coveted merchandise.
- Selectively hosting rAAVEs to bring the Aave community together, reward contributors and make Aave the top ecosystem in crypto.
- Developing GHO Pass payment portal.

| Name  |  Date  | Details |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ETH Global Istanbul  | Nov 17-19  | During the week of Devconnect. ETHGlobal puts on arguably the most reputable hackathon events in the Ethereum ecosystem. Istanbul is a community with substantial and growing crypto adoption and is a prime market to engage hackers and the community with Aave and GHO.  |
| rAAVE  | Nov TBD  | rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem. We will host one rAAVE during the course of this proposal that is powered by GHO to help spread adoption and awareness.  |
| Devconnect + Side Events  | Nov 13-19  | This will be the event of the year in the Ethereum community. Hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, this event will be one of the most attended web3 events of 2023. Activating here will allow us to reach a wide audience and connect with many from our community.  |
| Side Events	  | Q4  | Side events we’re currently considering include: SheFi Summit Istanbul, Certora at DevConnect, Scroll Day, notDevcon by ITU Blockchain, StableSummit Istanbul. Funds from any side events that are not confirmed will be rolled over to the next potential side event.  |

For this proposal, Aave Companies is focusing on sponsoring fewer events, while increasing the quality of Aave’s presence.

A majority of the new event spend will be used to have an impactful presence during Devconnect, ETHGlobal Istanbul, and rAAVE in order to drive hackers to build with GHO and to increase GHO utilization within the wider community. Since Devconnect week will be the marquee event of the year, any remaining budget after our main sponsorships will be allocated to side events related to DeFi or Smart Contract Security.

# Next Steps
- If Snapshot is successful then move to AIP

# Conclusion
Aave Companies is deeply committed to the Aave community. We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of $550,000 paid in GHO for activations and events will not only enrich the ecosystem but also foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition. We look forward to the DAO’s support in enabling these initiatives to come to life and continue to drive the growth of the Aave ecosystem.

title: Ethereum v2 Collector Contract Consolidation
author: @llamaxyz - Matthew Graham & dydy
discussion: 
shortDescription: Consolidate the assets held within the v2 Collector Contract.
created: 2022-12-02

---

# Summary

@llamaxyz proposes consolidating the Aave v2 Collector Contract holdings by swapping a portion of the long tail assets to USDC and redeeming assets from the Aave AMM deployment.

# Abstract

The Aave v2 Collector Contract has accumulated a holding in several assets over time. Assets from the v1, v2, RWA, ARC and AMM depoloyments all accumulate in the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract. This proposal is the first of several intended to consolidate the various Collector Contracts and Treasury holdings.

This proposal seeks to consolidate 17 assets in the v2 Ethereum Collector Contract to USDC and redeem ammTokens for the underlying assets. 

# Motivation

The DAO is currently accunulating over 60 assets in the v2 Collector Contract from various Aave deployments. Many of these holdings are of small economic value, are undercollateralized assets, or exhibit volatile pricing behaviour. Upon consolidating the DAOs assets into USDC, which most of the DAO's costs are denominated in, Llama intends to present the community with suggested recommendations for deploying a portion of the larger holdings.  

The AMM Liquidity Pool, v2, attracts very little capital and usage relative to other deployments. A number of the assets are frozen and, with v3 being deployed on Ethereum soon, it makes sense for the DAO to relocate this capital away from from the v2 AMM deployment. This proposal enables the following ammTokens, aAmmDAI, aAmmUSDC, aAmmUSDT, aAmmWBTC, and aAmmWETH to be redeemed periodically by calling a contract. Any actor will be able to interact with the contract via Etherscan. Llama, or anyone else, can redeem these ammTokens periodically with the underlying asset to be held within the v2 Collector Contract.

# Specification

Thie following assets held within the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract are to be converted to USDC via swap contract.

![](https://i.imgur.com/THUOfbb.png)

Users will be able to deposit USDC and receive the tokens mentioned in the table above, plus a small premium. The premium is expected to reimburse the cost incurred from swapping the applicable token to USDC along with associated gas costs. The methodology enables actors to support Aave in swapping one asset for another by creating an arbitrage opportunity in a decentralized manner. 

The following assets are to be redeemed from the AMM deployment.

![](https://i.imgur.com/dYnreQx.png)


# Implementation

The below outlines at a high level the flow of events this proposal will acheive:

1) Redeem aTokens and ammTokens for underlying asset
2) Deploy a Swap Contract whereby actors can deposit USDC and receive a selected token stated in the above table at the Chainlink Oracle price + premium
3) v2 Collector Contract receives USDC

## [TEMP CHECK] GHO Cross-Chain Rollout Plan - First Network
## Author: Aave Labs
## Date: 2024-04-19
---
## Summary
This Snapshot aims to formally capture the community's consensus on selecting the most appropriate network to initiate the cross-chain strategy for GHO.

## Motivation
Following the successful snapshot vote to employ Chainlink’s Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) as the first bridge for the cross-chain strategy of GHO, the development of a rollout plan is now imperative. A phased approach to the rollout will permit the DAO to initiate cross-chain GHO deployments in a controlled and secure manner, meticulously evaluating each step of the process and with time, sequentially broadening to additional networks.

The governance thread has functioned as an open and transparent platform for the DAO to gather information about potential opportunities for cross-chain GHO. Following the process outlined previously, and after receiving multiple network proposals and [insights from risk providers](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/10), it is now time for the community to make a decision on the preferred network for the initial launch of the cross-chain GHO strategy.

## Voting Options
Given the variety of network proposals submitted to the forum, below are the options for consideration (in order of when the proposals were received):
1. Metis
2. Avalanche
3. Scroll
4. Optimism
5. Arbitrum

Each network has been proposed as a potential candidate for initiating the cross-chain strategy of GHO. The community is now invited to review and decide on the most suitable network for this strategic expansion.

## Next Steps
Once the community has expressed its preference for the initial network to implement the cross-chain GHO strategy, the governance discussion will progress to the ARFC stage. This phase will involve compiling all necessary details pertaining to the cross-chain strategy, enabling the community to review and formally signal its approval.",bullish,85.76,2024-04-19 14:44:27+00:00,92.36,92.36,2024-04-20 00:00:00+00:00,7.69589552238805,91.445,0.0662896455223879,0.9330340027809144,True," The text discusses a proposal for selecting the first network for the cross-chain deployment of GHO, following a successful vote to use Chainlink's Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).

title: [ARFC] Add BAL Ethereum v3
Author: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consultants & @solarcurve (Balancer DAO)
Dated: 2023-01-31

---

# Summary

This proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard BAL to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

# Abstract

BAL is a strategic asset to Aave and any BAL earned from the pool could be used by Aave to bootstrap the adoption of GHO and/or the new aToken being developed by @AaveCompanies.

The risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the [initial forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum.

By presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.

# Motivation

Listing BAL as a priority for Aave v3 reflects the strategic relationship between the two communities. Balancer and Aave completed a [200,000 BAL for AAVE token swap](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/) and Aave later purchased an additional [100,000 BAL via a swap contract](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115/). With the launch of [GHO ](https://governance.aave.com/t/gho-development-update/10267)getting closer and the [new aToken](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406) from @AaveCompanies currently in queue for audit, the potential use cases for veBAL are numerous.

Due to the potential use cases for veBAL in supporting bootstrap the growth of Aave, the BAL token is considered a strategic asset. Therefore, we believe listing BAL on Aave v3 Ethereum is a priority.

Balancer DAO is a large provider of liquidity on Ethereum v2 and also Polygon v3. A proposal by @llamaxyz for Balancer to deposit [additional BAL](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-164-deposit-bal-into-aave-polygon-v3/4295) into Polygon v3, up to the current SupplyCap, was recently approved by Balancer DAO.

For listing BAL, this proposal uses risk parameters suggested by Gauntlet on the original [[ARC] Aave v3 Ethereum Deployment: Assets and Configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) post. The interest rate curve parameters have been sourced from @Llamaxyz’s [[ARFC] BAL Interest Rate Curve Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bal-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/10484) post, which has passed through Snapshot.

Decide an strategy to sunset Aave v1 Ethereum and Aave v1 AMM, given the existence for a long time already of v2 and v3 versions of the Aave liquidity protocol.

## Context
Aave V1 was deployed on the Ethereum network back in January 2020, being the first step of everything that would come afterward on the Aave ecosystem. Since then, countless developments happened in the community, amongst them, 2 more iterations of the protocol: Aave v2 and Aave v3.

After the deployment of Aave v2 Ethereum, almost 2 years ago (December 2020), the general approach of the community was to progressively sunset Aave v1, with steps like enabling a migration tool v1 → v2 and disabling stable borrowing on v1 (more information here https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-protocol-v1-v2-migration-tool-and-transition-plan/2053 2)

## Options proposed
- **Freezing (disable additive actions)**. Probably the natural one, to reduce any kind of overhead from the community going forward.
- **Disable variable borrowing**. Less aggressive, with the plan to follow up with another to freeze the pools.
- **Do nothing**. Keep v1 as it is, just waiting for everybody to exit the pool, and nobody entering.",bullish,58.4,2022-11-18 11:46:14+00:00,62.1,62.1,2022-11-20 00:00:00+00:00,6.33561643835616,57.400000000000006,-0.0171232876712327,0.9002971053123474,True," The text discusses a strategy to phase out Aave V1 from the Ethereum network due to the existence of newer versions, V2 and V3.

Title: [ARFC-Addendum] Update Merit for Round 4
Date: 2024-05-09
Author: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)
---

### Simple Summary

We propose updating Merit parameters and rewarded actions to increase program efficiency, as well as evolving the wETH part of the merit program with a new program called “Ahab”.

###  Motivation

Merit’s first quarter and three initial rounds have been a clear success. Morpho Optimizers are now a dead product with zombie remaining TVL, and GHO grew to $54M despite unfavorable market conditions. The Aave protocol maintained and developed its market share in DeFi in a highly competitive landscape thanks to the Merit program. While “Merit is Forever” has been approved by governance, we aim to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program.

### Specification

#### Boosters Update

Removal of “Second-degree user of aligned protocol”: due to lack of demand from second-degree protocols and investment in positioning Aave at the front row, this booster is no longer justified. We will reconsider reintroduction if some protocols show signs of Aave-alignment.
Introducing weETH in the “Diversity supporter” boost: weETH is the fastest-growing reserve in Aave V3 Ethereum, and this boost was designed to favor alternatives to main LST. It might be worth introducing a LRT to this boost.
Removal of OG DAO participant: this boost was designed to reward early participants in the Aave DAO, but it seems unfair for new users to keep having this boost after more than a quarter. We propose doubling the “Active in governance” boost to favor users supporting the DAO voting activity.

#### Diluters Update

StkGHO Cooldown users: we consider users declaring their intent to leave the safety module should not receive Merit rewards. A full dilution is seen as punitive and not in line with Aave’s ethos, so we propose stopping the points meter when these users call the cooldown method, allowing them to accumulate points until the cooldown activation.
Morpho Users: The Morpho protocol continues to show direct hostility towards the Aave ecosystem onchain & offchain. We propose including all present and future Morpho products.

#### Merit wETH Program

The merit wETH program has both been a total success and below expectations. This program has factually been the opportunity for >250k ETH to leave other protocols to join Aave, but these results are almost exclusively due to direct coordinated BD actions from Aave Finance & ACI with a small subset of “whale” users.

We consider it an inefficient allocation of resources to continue the program as it is. To upgrade this program, we propose focusing on the most efficient aspect and focusing on the BD “whale hunter” efforts. We propose rebranding this new part of the program as the “Ahab” program, which is expected to be significantly more budget-efficient than the current program.

### Next Steps

1. Gather community consensus on this proposed path.
2. If there is agreement, escalate this ARFC-Addendum proposal to a snapshot vote for formal approval.

### Disclamer

The Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes “Merit” without external compensation.

A proposal to update four (4) risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold (LT), Loan-To-Value (LTV), Liquidation Bonus (LB), and UOptimal for FEI on Aave V2 Ethereum.

## Motivation

As part of the ongoing risk mitigation strategies implemented for V2 Ethereum, this proposal suggests another series of risk parameter updates to minimize potential exposure to FEI. As a reminder, FEI has been frozen since [September 2022](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/96/), with the RF set at 99%.

Over the past months, we have witnessed a significant drop in market cap, and together with the recent price fluctuations, we recommend decreasing Aave’s FEI exposure to a minimum.

The recommended measures include the following:

1. Lowering LT and LTV to zero  - This will prevent new borrowings against FEI and potentially further protocol losses should FEI's price fluctuate due to limited liquidity.
  1. By reducing the LT to zero, two additional accounts will become eligible for liquidation, totaling a value of $1,051. The main account to be liquidated can be found [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/wallets/0xa41f03dd427100284ecaa24734b00abc037557c0)
2. Raising the LB from 6.5% to 10% to provide a stronger incentive for liquidators to address underwater positions.
3. Decreasing the UOptimal from 80% to 1% to increase the borrowing rate and encourage borrowers to repay their loans.

## Specification

|Asset|Parameter|Current|Recommendation|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|FEI|LT|75%|1%*|
|FEI|LTV|65%|0|
|FEI|LB|6.5%|10%|
|FEI|UOptimal|80%|1%|

**For technical reasons related to V2 we will set the LT 1% rather than at 0*

## Next Steps

1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.
2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.

Detailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)

KelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.

Kelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).

**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**

Following are liquidity stats for rsETH:

- rsETH has >55 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on the mainnet including
    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x58aadfb1afac0ad7fca1148f3cde6aedf5236b6d00000000000000000000067f) - $38 Mn
    - [Uniswap V3](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x059615EBf32C946aaab3D44491f78e4F8e97e1D3) - $12.42 Mn
    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $5 Mn
    - Few others
- ~$10 Mn+ average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 12th May)

**Oracles**:

rsETH is supported by Chainlink and Redstone oracles. Posted links below to the Oracle contracts:

Chainlink calculated price feed: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78C12ccE8346B936117655Dd3D70a2501Fd3d6e6

Chainlink market feed: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/rseth-eth

Redstone market feed:

[https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH\\\\ETH](https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH%5C%5C%5C%5CETH)

**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**

rsETH exchange rate is defined based on the underlying assets and rewards generated by those assets.

Accepted assets include ETH, stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH.

Exchange rate calculation -

A → Total ETH + Staking rewards accumulated from the chain

B → [Amount of ETHx] * [Value of 1 ETHx in ETH]

C → [Amount of sfrxETH] * [Value of 1 sfrxETH in ETH]

D → [Amount of stETH] * [Value of 1 stETH in ETH]

E → Total supply of rsETH

Exchange rate (rsETH / ETH) = [A + B + C + D] / E

**Withdrawals and risks**

Prior to this ARFC, the only way to exit rsETH was via DEXs. 

Nevertheless, KelpDAO users can now unstake rsETH, with an unbonding period of 7 to 8 days, due to Eigenlayer withdrawal period. That also means that any of the LST’s including stETH, ETHx or sfrxETH from Eigenlayer can be unstaked as well.

### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:

Anyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.

slisBNB is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) from ListaDAO, which aims to bring additional liquidity and utility to staked BNB. The token allows users to participate in the staking rewards while maintaining the flexibility to use their staked assets within the DeFi ecosystem.

Onboarding slisBNB will allow Aave users to utilize it as collateral, thus broadening the asset base and enhancing overall liquidity.

### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments

Users who supply slisBNB liquidity on Aave, will be eligible to get stardust (points) from Lista's ongoing point system Cosmic Adventure Challenge Season 3, which will turn to LISTA token airdrop when Season 3 ends.

### Specification

Token Name: slisBNB

Underlying Asset: Staked BNB

Contract: 0xB0b84D294e0C75A6abe60171b70edEb2EFd14A1B

A proposal to increase USDe’s debt ceiling.

# Motivation

USDe has reached its debt ceiling following rapid deposits and borrows against these deposits on Ethereum.


### Positions Analysis

There is currently one major user utilizing USDe as collateral on V3 Ethereum.
Account [0x8607a7d180de23645db594d90621d837749408d5](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x8607a7d180de23645db594d90621d837749408d5) is borrowing $33.26 M in stables (USDC and USDT) against his $45.72 M in USDe. The user’s current health score is 1.03.

While this market is heavily concentrated, simulated transactions indicate that this position could be liquidated efficiently.

Borrows of USDe are more distributed and are against a variety of collateral.

### Liquidity

USDe liquidity has improved since the asset’s listing, with especially large growth on Curve, related to ENA token incentives provided in multiple pools.  

It is critical to note that on-chain liquidity — as well as the ratio of sUSDe to USDe, amongst other things — is being shaped by ongoing ENA token incentives. While there is still ongoing speculative activity, our recommendations remain cautious, given that dynamics could change rapidly following this period of speculative activity.

We also note that USDe grew rapidly through May, reaching a high of over 3.6B, but has since declined to 3.4B. The reserve fund has also grown, though its size relative to USDe’s supply has fallen since the asset was listed, from 1.34% of total USDe supply to 1.33%.


We also note that the reserve fund has not grown in accordance with our recommendations following a detailed [assessment](https://596495599-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FsBsPyff5ft3inFy9jyjt%2Fuploads%2Fo8m81Tk4jhhs1G1ukT78%2FChaos%20Labs%20-%20Ethena%20Perpetual%20Assessment%20Report%20Final.pdf?alt=media&token=27261a67-eba0-4c2f-8359-328b5fac9c00) of Ethena’s mechanism, which called for the fund to maintain “sufficient capital to cover a 4.3% drawdown at all times.” 

### Recommendation

The current debt ceiling for USDe on V3 Ethereum, set at $40 M, has reached 100% utilization.

Given current market conditions, our [Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440) supports increasing the debt ceiling to $50 M.

It is important to note that the majority of USDe debt positions are concentrated within just one [user](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x8607a7d180de23645db594d90621d837749408d5), accounting for over 83% of the total debt (see Positions Analysis above). 
While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future recommendations and cases of significant market changes.

### Specification

| Chain | Asset | Current Debt Ceiling | Recommended Debt Ceiling  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ethereum | USDe | $40,000,000 | $50,000,000 |

# Next Steps

1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.
2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.

### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism

### **Author:  @Ethan - Threshold Network Growth Coordinator**

### **Date: 2024-04-24**

---

## **Summary**
The proposal aims to onboard Threshold Network’s tBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism. tBTC is backed one-to-one with Bitcoin.

## Motivation/Background:

tBTC is Threshold’s decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum's Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.

Having recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).

Benefits for Aave:

* Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.
* A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.
* Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.
* Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.
* Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium's LTIPP.

#### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Threshold Network has no link and is not compensated to present this TEMP CHECK proposal.

#### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.

tBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed by native BTC. Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.

tBTC is trust minimized and redeemable for native BTC without a centralized custodian. It can be used across the entire DeFi ecosystem.

tBTC can be used as collateral, liquidity, a store of value, and can be integrated with DeFi apps across all supported blockchains.

As with other BTC wrappers, tBTC provides cryptocurrency traders and general users with a BTC-pegged token, that can be used to generate yield whilst holding native BTC.

#### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

Adding support for tBTC on Aave V3 as an asset would allow tBTC holders to obtain a yield on their tBTC holdings.

In Aave’s [document hub](https://docs.aave.com/hub/), the first line self-describes Aave as “a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol”, Threshold Network is looking to help Aave fully realise this by allowing access to tBTC, which unlike its centralized competitor (wBTC), is the only way to permissionlessly borrow and lend BTC in a decentralized manner. This gives Aave direct access to the 1.3 trillion market and 106 million owners of BTC, for which wBTC provides limited access to.

#### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

tBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.

Threshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.

#### How is tBTC currently used?

tBTC is currently used across the Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon and Solana ecosystems. tBTC exhibits strong usecase across decentralized exchanges, lending on Solana and Bitcoin Options on Base and as collateral for crvUSD, a broad overview can be found here:
https://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC

#### Emission schedule

tBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.

#### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?

For tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation

The Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:

### Title: [ARFC] Expansion of ""Orbit"" - A DAO Funded Delegate Platform Initiative
### Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative
### Date: 2023-09-07

---

## Summary:

This ARFC proposes the expansion of the [""Orbit"" delegate platform initiative](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241), transitioning it from being funded by the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) to being funded by the Aave DAO. The goal is to enhance the sustainability and independence of the program, ensuring continued support for active delegates in the Aave community.

## Motivation:

The pilot phase of Orbit, funded by ACI, has been a success in its first quarter. Recognizing its positive impact, there's a need to expand and generalize the program, ensuring its longevity and alignment with the broader Aave community goals.

## Specification:

The proposed funding for the Orbit initiative remains at $5,000 per month, with payments to be made in GHO stablecoin. Orbit operates on a quarterly basis, with eligibility criteria defined for each quarter.

For the upcoming quarter, the eligibility criteria will mirror that of the [[ARFC] Quarterly Gas Rebate Distribution - August 2023](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680). In subsequent quarters, a threshold of voting power and diversity of delegation will be introduced to ensure the program's integrity and to prevent potential abuse. To fund the Orbit initiative, stablecoins from the Aave DAO treasury will be used to purchase GHO on secondary markets, which is expected to have a minor positive effect on the GHO peg.

### Eligible Delegates:

| Delegate Name | Address | Participation Rate |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|

381,623,1401,1401,1401,2023-03-27 18:55:20+00:00,aave,"## Summary

At the time of the launch of V3 Ethereum, no assets were configured as borrowable in Isolation Mode. In this proposal, Chaos Labs recommends enabling all stablecoins listed on V3 Ethereum as [borrowable in isolation mode](https://docs.aave.com/developers/whats-new/isolation-mode#borrow-in-isolated-mode).

## Motivation

The motivation to list the stablecoins as borrowable assets in Isolation Mode is similar to previous deployments and is derived mainly from the low volatility of those assets. Given that Isolation Mode assets are susceptible to high volatility, we find it paramount to maintain the other side of the position stable in order to reduce liquidations and resulting bad debt.

## Stablecoin Volatility

By observing chainlink prices of the 4 stablecoins on Ethereum V3, we have derived the following volatility measures:

|  | daily annualized volatility  | 30-day annualized volatility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USDC | 10.56% | 16.92% |
| USDT | 10.19% | 7.94% |
| DAI | 11.14% | 16.3% |
| LUSD | 7.07% | 10.64% |

title: [ARFC] Set Metis Foundation Wallet as Emission Manager for METIS Token on Aave V3 Metis Pool
author: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative
date: 2023-07-05
---

## Summary

This ARFC proposes to set the Metis Foundation wallet as the emission manager for the METIS token on the Aave V3 Metis pool. This will enable the Metis Foundation to define and fund incentive programs for this Aave pool, promoting growth and expanding the user base of this new Aave V3 market.

## Motivation

The Metis Foundation has expressed a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3 Metis pool. By setting their wallet as the emission manager for the METIS token, the Foundation will be able to directly fund incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets.

## Specification

The Metis Foundation wallet address is as follows:

Emission Admin Wallet (Metis Foundation): `0x97177cD80475f8b38945c1E77e12F0c9d50Ac84D`

The AIP call setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract.

`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(METIS, EMISSION_ADMIN);`

This method will set the Metis Foundation wallet as the emission admin for the METIS token.

# Simple Summary

This ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) finishes at a further 30% reduced rate.

In addition to tapering incentives on the Aave V2 market, the ARC proposes introducing incentives on the Aave ARC market. 10% of the 30% reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 ethereum market are to be applied to incentivising AUM on the Aave ARC Ethereum market.

# Abstract

Liquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG), renewed by [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) and then incentives were reduced by 30% with the implementation of [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) which expires on the 20th February 2022. A summary is shown below.

* [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG): 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 26th Apr 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E): [2,200 stkAAVE per day](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) from 24th Aug 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH): 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd Nov 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* AIP-X: 1,078 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* AIP-X: 46.2 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market

Continuing on from AIP-47, incentives on low vol assets are to be split 1:2 in favour of borrowers over lenders. This logic will be applied to both Aave V2 and ARC markets. High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.

# Motivation

This proposal continues on from AIP-47 with a further 30% tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior [ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946) and shall last for another proposed 90 day period. We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market.

The incentive APR will fall, even though TVL has reduced with market conditions so has AAVE’s token price.

In addition to incentivising Aave V2 Ethereum market, I would like to present to the community an opportunity to commence distributing stkAAVE incentives on the Aave ARC market with the intention of achieving the following:

1. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)
2. Increase liquidity
3. Attractive (low) borrow rates
4. Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor
5. Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform

Within this proposal we will present two options for the Aave ARC markets, Option 2) will reflect a Total Value Locked in Aave ARC of $250M. This represents a 12.6x increase in TVL from what is a low base. The next iteration of liquidity mining will likely see an increased allocation to Aave ARC as we continue to encourage users to interact with the market. The initial target here is to grow Aave ARV to over $250M within the next 90 days and then pivot as required to support continual growth of the market.

# Specification

The below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 21.02.2021 up to and including 20.05.2022.

Key changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign:

* 30% reduction in incentives to 1,078 stkAAVE per day on Aave V2 Ethereum market
* Introduction of 26.2 stkAAVE per day on Aave ARC Ethereum market
* Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value

The table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave V2 Ethereum market asset listings. In estimating the Borrowing vAPR, a 75% utilisation of the deposited assets was assumed. This was based on the current DAI utilisation.

Note: TVL per token is as per the 3rd February 2022.

The table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave ARC market asset listings.

Option 1) Same Methodology as above allocating 10% of the reduction in Aave V2 Ethereum Market stkAAVE incentives. Ie: 10% of (1,540-1,078)

Option 2) Similar methodology to the above with an assumed market size of $250M and distribution across the assets of 60% USDC, 20% ETH and 10% of both wBTC and AAVE.

Asset Value Deposited Multiplier Daily stkAAVE Incentive LM Allocation (%) LM Incentive Split (%) LM vAPR (%)

Mathematics: % of value deposited x multiplier then scaled to provide LM Allocation that totals 100%. [Link here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trx6tYr1jy5Izs-IfPTrGCp1y6EExCgyu4P8pme_Y_8/edit?usp=sharing)

# Rationale

The previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal. The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC reflects a desire to grow this mainnet market. Incentivising the Aave ARC market is funded from the reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1,540 to 1,124.2 stkAAVE per day.

Aarve ARC Option 1) we show what impact allocating 10% of the savings from the reduced Aave V2 Ethereum market would look like following a similar allocation strategy to the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The mathematics assumes 75% utilisation of lending pools capital is borrowed which reflects the current utilisation of the DAI pool on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. With zero wBTC deposited in the market, and still very low capital being deposited, this approach is heavily skewed towards USDC and mis represents what is expected with time.

Aave ARC Option 2) we elected to view the incentives in line with $250M and assumed a distribution across the pools. The distribution is an assumption and is quite different to the existing distribution on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. We can easily change these parameters and are happy to do so. The high level logic is to anticipate capital being deposited and then estimating what the vAPR from incentives would equate to. For this we assumed $250M which is arbitrarily chosen as a nice round target, it represents over 10x growth in the market TVL.

# Discussion

The previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets. Link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946). Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market, large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing. (Lending vAPY, - borrowing vAPR, + Borrowing Incentives vAPR, + Lending vAPY)

With the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas. Time in the pool is also a huge factor, and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so. However, it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now. Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions. The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider.

With the introduction of incentives on Aave ARC, even with around $250M deposited 60% in USDC, the strategy would be profitable with a 75% utilisation rate. This risks assets currently deposited in the Aave V2 Ethereum market being reallocated to the Aave ARC market. If this was to occur the vAPR from incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market would increase. It will be interesting to see what effect this has on the value deposited in each pool. Pending how the market reacts to these proposed changes, we can always revisit this and propose an amendment to the distribution schedule across both markets.

## Economics

* Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $44.5K per day during late January 2022. Daily aToken interest is around $1.9K per day.
* Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $168,630 per day assuming 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Down from $231,000 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Note, previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of $320.
* Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $296.89M with an AAVE price of $150.
* 90 days at 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token is $15.18M or around 5.11% of the Ecosystem Reserve.
* The Net spend is $122K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE/day Safety Module incentives
* Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions. Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue.

Further details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community. Please note, each query will need to be run separately.

Present to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development services, after Phase 1 and 2.

---
---

# 1. Motivation. Aave and BGD 1, 2….3

May 9th 2022, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 1, a proposal for services to the DAO, covering a pretty extensive scope on the big majority of Aave sub-systems; development and security related.

During the following 15 months, we [did or participated in dozens of projects](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-working-day-365/13033)  of technical nature for the Aave DAO, and more importantly, we set precedent that a model of a fully independent company providing services to a decentralised entity can work.

September 4th 2023, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 2, with similar type of scope as Phase 1, but with slightly different objectives in mind: the technical foundation of the Aave DAO was pretty solid from Phase 1, and possible to iterate on top of it, with a more concrete scope.
Additionally, we set ourselves as a goal to study how to introduce extra technical parties to service specific needs of the DAO, helping more on the decentralisation of the organisation, but without disturbing operations and delivery.

Also, we proposed a way shorter engagement (6 months), which we thought was more optimal for the DAO to have capacity to manoeuvre. The outcome of this work can be found [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bored-ghosts-phase-2-recap/16791).



We think that our services to the DAO on both Phases had played a role on Aave staying in top of its category for years in so nascent field, and the Aave codebase being used in other products, accounting to close to 75% of total market share category.

Now we present Phase 3, continuist, but with some important changes in terms of scope.

---
---

# 2. Specification. Aave <> BGD Phase III. The scope

This time, we want to explicit divide our proposal in 2 different and explicit components, each one with its separate scope, budget and duration characteristics.

## Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO

This scope is the continuist component historically performed by BGD for the DAO, and will be composed of the following items:

- Maintain, improve and consolidate all the Aave tooling introduced in Phases I & II, including but not limited to Aave Address Book, Aave Helpers, Aave Proposals, Risk Stewards, Seatbelt and Killswitch.
- Maintain and improve Aave Governance v3, a.DI and Aave Robot, together with the tooling surrounding them.
    
    The following new items will be delivered, consequence of the research done on Phase 2:
    
    - Extend coverage of voting networks to rollups, apart from the current Polygon PoS and Avalanche C-Chain.
    - Allow voting with AAVE tokens held in non-Ethereum networks.
    - Granular and generalised consensus rules for a.DI, together with different planned optimisations.
- Propose further improvements on top of the upcoming Aave 3.1.
- Different v3 maintenance tasks with important development requirements, including:
    - Improve asset off-boarding procedures.
    - Complete removal of stable debt logic.
- Act as reviewers of Aave <> Immunefi for all current Aave ecosystem, not including GHO (Avara currently being the reviewer). Additionally, doing proper maintenance of the bug bounty program.
- Act as security coordinator of the Aave ecosystem, including:
    - Continuously evaluate potential technical risks for Aave.
    - Design specific protection strategies in the event of any vulnerability affecting Aave.
    - If arising, create governance proposals to mitigate any type of problem affecting Aave.
    - Coordinate with the Aave Guardian for protective emergency actions.
- Support with further technical off-boarding strategies for legacy versions of Aave (v1, v2) in a safe manner, both for the DAO and the users of the protocol.
- Advise other contributors on which security procedures to apply for their developments, when required.
- Evaluate new upcoming high-level technical implications/risks for the protocol, for example, new types of assets being listed.
- Generally advise other contributors, whenever feedback from an entity expert on the Aave protocol is required. This includes but is not limited to contributors on the risk, treasury, security reviews and miscellaneous fields.
- Review governance proposals on pre-onchain stage, not as a full security audit, but in order to verify that we don’t see any integration problem with Aave’s smart contracts and good practises.

---

*Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO*

**DURATION**: same as with Phase 2, 6 months, starting from proposal execution.

**BUDGET**: as some items are not included in the scope (more later), the budget has been reduced from Phase 2. 1’600’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 60% paid up-front and 40% streamed during the 6 months engagement.


## What is NOT part of the scope

- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.
- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora.
- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor.
Given our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.
- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.
- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so.
Any tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.

---
---

## Scope 2: Aave Safety Module - Code A

As commented before, we believe now the Aave DAO is in a really solid stage of their current systems, quite future-proof and ready to scale:

- Aave v3 is a solid liquidity layer, on which is possible to iterate and improve.
- Aave Governance v3 is probably the most advanced on-chain governance system in production.
- a.DI is a totally generic bridging layer, that can be used for any cross-chain communication need on the Aave ecosystem, in a secure and scalable manner.
- Aave Robot is a solid automation layer, integrated with Chainlink Automation, but flexible enough for any technology.

More in the line of innovative projects like Aave Governance v3, we propose to create a completely new system in an Aave component which requires improvement: the Aave Safety Module.


### Aave Safety Module: Code A

Safety Module Code A is the major project on the innovation side of this scope, but different to previous cases, our proposed approach is different: at the moment, we will not disclose a detailed description of it, as we think this is the right strategic approach for the DAO.

However, we can say the following about Code A:

- It will change completely the dynamics of the Safety Module and its components, including stkGHO, stkAAVE and stkABPT.
- More efficient mechanism than the current.
- Improved use experience.
- Heavily improved dynamics for builders to build on top, but still batteries included.
- Affecting importantly AAVE tokenomics.
- Holistically designed, taking into account Aave v3 and GHO.
- Directly/indirectly benefiting any future project of the DAO.

We are aware this requires some trust by the community on our research and execution capabilities (which is reflected on the payment schedule), but considering that the main beneficiary will be explicitly the DAO and our history of services, we think it is acceptable.

---

*Scope 2. Safety Module Code A*

**DURATION**: this scope is not continuous like Scope 1, but our estimation is similar for full completion, approximately during the next 6 months to have everything fully ready and in production.
However, delivery and communications will definitely be iterative, with extensive details of Project A to be disclosed in the first 2 months, and highly probably some of its components.

**BUDGET**: 1’900’000 in stablecoins and 7’500 AAVE, with the following schedule:

- 40% upfront.
- 60% in a delayed payment in 4-months from now, when we estimate to be in good stage of completion.

---
---

## Terms of Service

- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the major software we have produced during our engagement have been licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.
    
    To insist on the previous fundamental implication: 
    
    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.
    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.
    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.
    
    Even if other models can be explorer, from our point of view, this is a pretty solid contribution model for the innovation side of the DAO.
    
- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.
- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.

Description: This proposal outlines a new project within the Aave ecosystem aimed at significantly improving the Aave Safety Module. The project is called Safety Module Code A and it will revolutionize the dynamics of the Safety Module and its components, including stkGHO, stkAAVE, and stkABPT.

Key Features:
- Completely changes the Safety Module's dynamics and components.
- More efficient mechanism than the current one.
- Improved user experience.
- Enhanced dynamics for builders to build upon, while still being user-friendly.
- Significantly affects AAVE tokenomics.
- Holistically designed, taking into account Aave v3 and GHO.
- Directly/indirectly benefits any future project of the DAO.

Scope: The project is estimated to be completed within the next 6 months, with iterative deliveries and communications in the first 2 months.

Budget: The total budget for this project is 1'900'000 stablecoins and 7'500 AAVE, with a payment schedule of 40% upfront and 60% in a delayed payment after 4 months.

Title: [ARC] LDO Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool
Author: @llamaxyz @MatthewGraham
Dated: 2022-11-05

---

# Simple Summary

In preparation for distributing incentives on the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool, @llamaxyz proposes amending the `Emission_Admin` address to enable the distribution of LDO rewards.

# Abstract

In collaboration with Lido, Llama seeks to distribute LDO incentives to the stMATIC Reserve on Polygon Aave v3. In order to achieve this, the `EmissionManager` contract needs to assign an owner to the `Emission_Admin` permission allowing LDO rewards to be distributed, [1,2]. This can only be achieved via the governance process.

This proposal assigns the `Emission_Admin` permission to LDO rewards to the following address `0x87D93d9B2C672bf9c9642d853a8682546a5012B5`. This address is controlled by Lido.

# Motivation

The motivation of the proposal is to enable LDO rewards to be distributed on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.

# Specification

The Lido Liquidity Mining Committee determines the emission rate and duration at which LDO rewards are offered. Standard practice is for the council to meet and determine the next 30 days of LDO rewards on a rolling basis. This means each month, the committee will determine if to extend the LDO rewards, or change the amount of LDO being offered across the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.

The `Emission_Admin` is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool. The `EmissionManager` determines the LDO `Emission_Admin` and not the stMATIC Reserve. The `Emission_Admin` can distribute LDO anywhere across the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool.

# Implementation

Set `Emission_Admin` permission for LDO on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool to Lido’s address: `0x87D93d9B2C672bf9c9642d853a8682546a5012B5`

**Authors:** [@noturhandle](https://governance.aave.com/u/noturhandle) [@lajarre](https://governance.aave.com/u/lajarre) ([Butter](https://buttery.money/))

**Date:** 2023-04-03

## Summary

This Temperature Check has been created to enable the Aave community to select a delegate for the three-month incentivized Delegate Campaign organized by Butter.

The campaign will be funded by a $15k grant received in AAVE (~222 AAVE) from the Aave Grants DAO, which will be used to compensate the winning delegate for their efforts on behalf of tokenholders during the three-month term.

Thirteen candidates applied for the campaign—each will be presented as options in this proposal.

## The 3-month Incentivized Delegate Campaign

During the three-month term of the Delegate Campaign, the winning delegate is expected to perform governance duties on behalf of tokenholders. To ensure maximum alignment between the elected delegate and the voters, each candidate has been asked to produce a Delegate Initiative, which can be found [at this link](https://butterd.notion.site/Butter-d-Aave-Delegate-Initiatives-45e1ce2ac08a4b4298518b193ed8a7ce).

The Butter team will monitor the elected delegate and report on goals and KPIs related to the Delegate Initiative to help voters evaluate the delegate’s performance.

For the first pilot version of Butter’s Delegate Campaign program, the compensation mechanism is not yet permissionless. However, Butter will provide compensation on at least a monthly basis (or more frequently). More updates on this will be available soon.

## The Candidates

The candidates for the vote are listed below, in reverse alphabetical order. At ACI’s suggestion, we’ve decided to use the [Weighted Voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types#weighted-voting) voting type for this election to allow tokenholders to support multiple candidates:

**Title**: *[ARFC] BGD. Security budget request - December 2023*

**Author**: *BGD Labs (@bgdlabs)*

**Date**: *2023-12-8*

---

## Summary
Request for a budget of $121’200 for 2 security review procedures on Aave, together with a refund of $30’000 to BGD for the Aave Governance v3 extra voting tokens audit.A


**Amounting a grand total of $151'200**.


## Motivation
Part of [our scope Aave <> BGD Phase II](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-bored-ghosts-developing-phase-2/14484#scope-6) is the planning, engagement, and coordination with security partners of the DAO.

During the previous year and a half, Aave was in a pretty intensive delivery phase (Aave v3 improvements, GHO, Aave Governance v3, a.DI), and we thought it was appropriate to have continuous engagement with 2 security firms like Certora and SigmaPrime.

Even if this worked well, and [we still think that Certora should stay with a continuous engagement](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-continuous-security-proposal-aave-certora/15732/4), we also think that there is room for optimisation, and it is a good idea to do more ad-hoc requests for the security budget, depending on the needs.

This ARFC is an initial request, for budget required in the short term on item part of our development services scope, together with another more general we consider pretty important.

## Specification
This request has 3 components, which we want to explain to the community:

---

**1. Compensation for Mixbytes review of Governance v3 tokens**

During the activation of Aave Governance v3 on October 17th, we detected a problem with the voting assets, which required the cancellation of the proposal, the development of a fix, and re-apply security procedures.

Given that it was already audited code, we also decided to do an extra security review by another security firm, Mixbytes.

For the sake of speed and reducing bureaucratic blockers, **BGD paid for the cost of said security review of $30’000, and now we will include on this proposal a refund request for that amount**.

---

**2. Compensation for security review on a feature of Aave 3.1**

Also part of our Phase 2 scope is to do a series of improvements to Aave v3, in order to reach a 3.1 version, from the current 3.0.2.

Generally, we are confident with Certora reviewing all the planned items until now, but there is one exception (an specific feature) to which we thought an extra review was required, and we engaged Emanuele Ricci (@StErMi), a top-level security researcher with knowledge of Aave to do it.
We will be publishing soon everything to be included into v3.1.

Same as with Mixbytes, BGD has paid the cost of said security review of $12’000, and now we include the refund request on this proposal.

---

**3. Engagement with Spearbit for Aave v3 ad-hoc review**

Aave v2/v3 is a production system with billions of dollars in size, and one of the most evaluated protocols security-wise.
However, security is a continuous process, and always worth it to improve whenever it feels necessary.

During the last 1-2 months, we have noticed different security exploits in the space following similar patterns. None of them affected Aave, but apart from our continuous analysis of the system security-wise, we think it is necessary to do an extra round of review in critical parts of Aave, for additional assurance.

We have coordinated an engagement for this review scope with Spearbit, one of the leading security firms in the space, that will involve 3 of their top researchers checking in-depth different components that we identify as critical on Aave.

This engagement is scheduled to start in the second part of December, and different from the others, the payment requested in the proposal will be direct to Spearbit, for an amount of $109’200.

---

From a technical perspective:
- The proposal will send $42'000 to BGD as compensation for the expenses of part 1) and 2).
- $109'200 will be sent to a Spearbit wallet, to compensate for the services to be provided on part 3).

This includes a refund of $30,000 for a previous security review and compensation for two new security reviews on Aave's Governance v3 tokens and a feature of Aave 3.1. Additionally, they plan to engage Spearbit for an ad-hoc review of critical parts of Aave v3 for additional assurance. The budget will be used to compensate BGD for the expenses incurred in the first two components and directly pay Spearbit for their services. This request is part of the ongoing collaboration between Aave and BGD Labs, aiming to improve the security of the Aave protocol.",bullish,medium

Gauntlet's risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify liquidation bonus on two (2) Aave V3 Optimism assets without adding outsized market risk.


Additionally, we provide user position analysis below.



## Abstract
These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. 


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

# Optimism Recs

## Aave V3 Optimism Parameter Changes Specification

Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at reasonable levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. Our simulations show that we can improve the balance of risk and capital efficiency by lowering the liquidation bonus for WBTC and raising the liquidation bonus for sUSD on Optimism Aave v3.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|  WBTC Liquidation Bonus   |  10.0%    | 9.4%  |
|  sUSD Liquidation Bonus   |   5.0%   | 5.4% |





## Aave V3 Optimism Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V3 Optimism Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aavev3_optimism) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V3 Optimism.

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

title: [ARFC] Safety Module - Polygon & Avalanche Coverage Update
author: @TokenLogic
created: 2023-09-03

---

# Summary

This publication proposes updating the Safety Module (SM) coverage across the various iterations of Aave Protocol on Polygon and Avalanche networks.

SM coverage is to be removed from Polygon v2 and Avalanche v2 deployments and extended to Avalanche v3.

# Motivation

With the continued migration of users from v2 to v3, this publication seeks to further encourage users to migrate by removing the SM coverage for Aave v2 deployments on the Polygon and Avalanche networks.

During 2023, the total market size on Avalanche and Polygon Aave v2 Protocol deployments has been trending lower. At the time of writing the total market size of Aave v2 on Avalanche and Polygon is $36.2M and $134.7M respectively. For comparison, the Aave v3 deployment on each network is $199.8M and $229.9M respectively. 

By removing SM coverage for Avalanche and Polygon v2 deployments, Aave DAO will no longer be providing coverage for the outdated iterations of Aave Protocol with exception of the Aave ARC deployment. By removing the SM coverage, users are further encouraged to migrate to v3.

The Polygon Aave v3 deployment is already covered by the SM whilst the Avalanche v3 deployment is not cover by the SM. This publication seeks to extend the SM coverage to include Avalanche v3. Therefore both v3 iterations are covered by the SM and v2 iterations are not covered on Polygon and Avalanche. 

For reference, at the time of writing, the following Aave Protocol deployments are covered by the SM:

* Ethereum v2
* [Ethereum v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2cbfeb5c5329c4d1720dbae4045386fceb2d2a9bd5b42a81cee47ea5c934f491)
* [Polygon v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7da4985b2d5b1cbe6bbc0992d5c86030cedef2013487e4b53b4244c315c90155)
* [Avalanche v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreiba2pdfwoesezgpedf37bjfgadxmaigavoulek5wayqb7f2tz6byy)
* [Aave ARC](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreieeyh6pbqwhgryo6v67oxlmnfhaptrgkc3u7y6bvz2y3jdkxgrrh4)

# Specification

It is important to note based upon the current implementation of the SM, an adhoc AIP is required to implement a Shortfall Event.

The following Snapshot votes will be created to enable granular voting:

* Extend SM Coverage to Avalanche v3
* Remove SM Coverage for Polygon v2
* Remove SM Coverage for Avalanche v2

Upon conclusion of the Snapshot vote, if approved, SM coverage will be removed/extended to the respective market.

There is no need for an AIP to implement this upgrade.

title: Add FEI to Aave V2
status: Proposed
author: Joey Santoro (@joeysantoro), Brianna Montgomery (@bpm6867)
shortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for the FEI stablecoin
discussions: https://discord.gg/aDeErjS6Dt
created: 2021-06-16
updated: N/A
---

## Simple Summary

Fei Protocol issues a decentralized, scalable USD stablecoin called FEI. FEI aims to become a widely used decentralized stablecoin that reduces centralization risk throughout DeFi.

## Abstract

FEI is backed by protocol owned reserves used to provide liquidity and stabilize the peg. The Fei community is committed to using decentralized reserve assets and oracles to have FEI be as decentralized as possible. FEI is an ideal candidate to be included on Aave to provide more decentralized stablecoin alternatives.

## Motivation

Being the liquidity protocol, Aave understands the need for robust capital efficient liquidity in creating healthy markets. DAI and sUSD being the current available options for decentralized stablecoins is good but likely insufficient longer term. Having more options like FEI will improve liquidity and optionality for protocols which are committed to decentralization.

FEI brings with it substantial liquidity in the form of the $500m ETH-FEI pair on Uniswap V2. This can allow ETH leverage traders a capital efficient way to benefit from Aave liquidity and FEI liquidity. The yield paid by these traders will attract more FEI liquidity to Aave, benefiting both ecosystems.

## Specification

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?
@Brianna is a core team member at Fei Labs focused on ecosystem development.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token
FEI is a decentralized and scalable stablecoin for DeFi.

3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

If listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity, approved via snapshot for 25 million. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($561 million) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Fei Protocol launched in April 2021 with a DAO since day one, and currently has over $643 million in liquidity. Fei aligns itself with the top communities and teams in the space, including Aave, with a similar decentralization ethos. There has been a large voter turnout during important community and team lead proposals that supported stabilizing the peg after the initial launch of the protocol.

5. How is the asset currently used?
FEI is currently being used in lending markets, including Fuse, and soon to be CREAM. FEI is growing and finding utilization in other financial service offerings in the broader DeFi ecosystem: lending, synthetics, option platforms, exchanges and AMM’s, etc.

6. Emission schedule

There is no emission schedule.

7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?
Contracts within the Fei protocol have the ability to mint and burn FEI through processes that support stabilization around the 1 USD price target. The DAO controlled by TRIBE holders has the ability to mint FEI and appoint other Minter and Burner contracts.

The FEI contract itself is not upgradeable.

An additional role, the Guardian, can pause the minting of FEI. The Fei Core Team holds this role in a multi-sig, with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig. More information can be read in our docs: https://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-guardian 1

6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

	Market Cap: $527,000,000

## Rationale
Because FEI is an earlier stage project the proposal is only for depositing and lending. The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is appropriate for similar stablecoins per https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.

## Implementation

The FEI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FEI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).

FEI will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:


  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo
  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0
  - Liquidation Threshold: 0
  - Liquidation Bonus: 0
  - Borrowing Enabled: true
  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false
  - Reserve Decimals: 18
  - Reserve Factor: 2000

Following the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:

title: Add FRAX to Aave V2
status: Proposed
author: Jason Huan (@jasonhuan_)
shortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for the FRAX stablecoin
discussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-frax/2621
created: 2021-08-25
---

## Simple Summary

Frax is the first algorithmic-stablecoin protocol, backed through on-chain collateral and algorithmically. Frax has two tokens, the FRAX stablecoin pegged at $1 and the FXS governance + seigniorage token, and aims to be a decentralized crypto-native unit of account with the upcoming Frax Price Index (FPI). FRAX has stayed at $1 for its entire existence, being the only non-traditional stablecoin to keep its peg perfectly in 8 months of release.

## Abstract

The FRAX stablecoin is partially backed with on-chain collateral and partially backed algorithmically, according to a collateral ratio (CR) parameter that the system adjusts according to market conditions. In Frax v2, the protocol is able to mint FRAX into lending markets using [Algorithmic Market Operations](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/overview) (AMOs), smart contracts which have the ability to print FRAX up to certain thresholds adjustable by governance.

## Motivation

As the value of Aave's TVL increases, borrow liquidity for stablecoins against volatile assets lent to Aave is one of the key benefits that is offered to lenders of the protocol. The flow of newly minted stablecoins to their decentralized lending market destination such as Aave is not always direct, and may face market inefficiencies through layers of actors.

By [deploying an AMO for Aave](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/frax-lending), the Frax protocol is able to mint FRAX to be borrowed by lenders of Aave, and thus offer an active and competitive alternative to other stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, and DAI. By allowing for responsive stablecoin liquidity, we aim to benefit lenders and the Aave ecosystem as a whole.

Additionally, With no collateral factor, there is 0 risk for Aave's money market in terms of the FRAX peg. Furthermore, if the FRAX peg broke and fell below $1, Aave borrowers would have less debt in dollar terms.

## Specification

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

	- Co-founder of Frax.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

	- FRAX is the world's first fractionally-algorithmic stablecoin, stabilized with parts on-chain collateral and parts algorithmically.

3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

	- Frax's AMOs are able to mint FRAX into the Aave lending market, allowing for highly competitive stablecoin borrowing rates for lenders.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

	- FRAX launched at the end of 2020 and currently has over $300M in circulating FRAX. FRAX has never once broken the peg of $1, even through sharp market downturns such as in March 2021. Frax's governance token FXS has maintained governance functionality since inception through a fork of Compound's GovernorAlpha.

5. How is the asset currently used?

	- FRAX is currently used as a stablecoin in decentralized exchanges and other lending markets such as Rari's Fuse Protocol, where it is currently the most-borrowed and most-supplied stablecoin in several pools through Frax's AMOs.

6. Emission schedule

	- There is no emission schedule; FRAX is mintable by anyone anytime by depositing corresponding amounts of collateral and FXS into the system's contracts.

7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability

	- The protocol is highly modular in terms of system parameters such as oracle addresses and AMO additions. The core contracts such as the token contract itself are non-proxy deployed and permissioned through governance's 2-day timelock, with a backup multisig admin address managed by the core Frax team.

8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

    - Market Cap: $307M
    - 24h Volume: $15M
    - Volatility: Extremely Low
    - Maturity: Early-Mid

9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)

	- 13K followers on Twitter, 6.2K members on Telegram, Github is updated frequently.

10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens

    - Date of Deployment: December 20th, 2020
    - Number of Transactions: 110,000+
    - Number of Holders: 1,600+

## Rationale

Frax's design rationale came as a synthesis of a crypto-native stablecoin with capital efficiency, allowing it to perform algorithmic market operations while managed by on on-chain DAO. As Frax expands, it can compound on its own network effects by being a highly liquid routing asset on DEXes and a default borrowing option for many lending market pools. To keep decentralization at the forefront, the USDC collateral is spread out through other lending markets and DEXes, and is planned to be rotated to ETH and ETH-equivalent collateral as the protocol matures. Furthermore, the Frax Price Index (FPI) allows for a shift away from the USD unit-of-account into the first major stable crypto-native unit-of-account.

## Implementation

The FRAX price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FRAX/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).

FRAX will only be used for depositing and lending and not as collateral, with a Loan-to-Value (LTV) value of 0%. The other parameters are as such:


  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo
  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0
  - Liquidation Threshold: 0
  - Liquidation Bonus: 0
  - Borrowing Enabled: true
  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false
  - Reserve Decimals: 18
  - Reserve Factor: 1000

Following the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:

- Interest bearing aFRAX address: 0x4ca44E16DAbcdB5a770eA623aca3adCcCde6fBb3
- Variable Debt variableDebtFRAX address: 0x861CbFc3e727d2CF2F0af964395e447C28d4967e

## Audits/Security Reviews

[Trail of Bits Audit](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/FraxFinance.pdf)

[CertiK Audit](https://www.certik.org/projects/fraxfinance)

**Note that the risk assessment was performed in May 2021, when FRAX's market cap was $110M**

**FRAX Smart Contract Risk**: **C**

Frax has been live on the Ethereum mainnet for over 8 months.

**FRAX Counterparty Risk**: **C+**

Currently the Frax protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol is meant to be governance minimized with a gradual transition to DAO + comptrollers.

**FRAX Market Risk**: **B**

The current FRAX market cap is over $307,000,000 USD. The average 24H trading volume in the past month has been over $14,000,000 USD. FRAX's volatility is negligible on Curve and Uniswap v3.

**FRAX Overall Risk**: **B-**

Three distinct levels from which the community can select a preferred risk tolerance for Aave V2. 

## Abstract 

From a market risk perspective, the goal for Gauntlet’s simulations is to standardize Value-at-Risk (VaR) across all assets. Matching risk tolerance to a normalized expected yield throughout Aave V2 ensures no subset of assets adds disproportionate risk to the Safety Module.

Following asset onboarding, empirical data on user behaviour (e.g., average health factors) and changes in market conditions (e.g., expected slippage) improve our simulation precision. Improved precision allows for higher confidence in model outputs—particulary for aggressive recommendations.

Gauging risk appetite is something Gauntlet will do quarterly to ensure our risk parameter recommendations track the preference of the Aave community.


## Motivation 

The existing [risk framework](https://docs.aave.com/risk/) has been instrumental in facilitating onboarding new assets. As expected and observed, liquidity risk, volatility risk, and market capitalization frequently change for all assets on Aave. Updating LTV and Liquidation thresholds to remain in lockstep with the market is key to improving the target metrics outlined in Gauntlet's [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters/4854#proposal-4) proposal.

- **WBTC**: Downside slippage values for WBTC have become smaller. This means liquidators see less slippage on trades and more liquidity. Additionally, a tight liquidation buffer will suffice given the lower market volatility.
- **YFI**: Both slippage values and volatility have improved for YFI. The liquidation buffer shrinks between conservative and aggressive parameters due to marginal increase of liquidations observed during simulation. Doing so provides users an option to be more aggressive with starting positions should they choose.
- **LINK**: Given market liquidity and LINK supplier's borrow positions, the aggressive setting will only include an increase in liquidation threshold.
- **xSUSHI**: Recent liquidation analysis on empirical data, lacking previously, provides higher confidence that insolvency events can be mitigated. 
- **SNX**: The major concern with for SNX is that there is very high volatility and high slippage. The aggressive setting requires a larger delta between LTV and liquidation threshold to compensate for the additional risk.

# ARC: Risk Parameter Updates 2021-10-14


## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across eight (8) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus.


## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These paramater updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations, the latest being [AIP-40: Risk Parameter Updates 2021-10-07](https://app.aave.com/governance/40-QmSvHc7UezXJwMoMnHcJTb2Hb6dRR2ZW2rfmwjkUwVoM4m).


## Motivation

This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. For more detail on Gauntlet's first two months of recommendations and their impact, please see our [Monthly Risk Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-updates-and-review-october-2021/5887).

Add GHST as collateral on Aave Polygon market.

The DeFi Case for GHST Medium Post:  https://aavegotchi.medium.com/the-defi-case-for-ghst-256a8653346a

## Overview:
GHST is the eco-governance token of Aavegotchi, a fast-growing NFT game live on Polygon with NFTs backed by Aave aTokens, single-staking with 50-100% APY, multiple liquidity mining partnerships, and its own secondary market for NFT trading. 

GHST token has been live on Ethereum Mainnet since September 2020, when it was launched via a continuous bonding curve DAICO sale (still live today at aavegotchi.com/curve). 

The token was launched at 0.2 DAI / GHST and currently sits at around 2.10 DAI. The all-time high is around 2 DAI / GHST. GHST is priced in DAI because unlike most tokens in crypto, it is actually backed by a DAI reserve at a 33% connecting weight. This makes the price more stable because it takes more in/out to change the price. 

GHST was bridged to Polygon in January 2021, with more than 50% of its current total supply locked into the Polygon Bridge. It is well-distributed, with more than 17,000 holders and stakers on Ethereum and Polygon combined, and is very active, with more than 1.2 million transactions and an average volume of $50M on multiple top-tier CEXes and DEXes. 

## Use Cases within the AAVE Ecosystem
GHST has many use cases which make it an excellent choice for being listed as an Aave collateral:
* Staking in Aavegotchi Staking contracts, earning FRENS
* Providing liquidity on DEXes
* Participating in #BidToEarn Auctions, where getting outbid earns you GHST
* Staking as collateral within Aavegotchi NFTs
* Purchasing and trading Aavegotchi NFT assets 

GHST’s relatively low normalized volatility also makes it an excellent choice for a collateral for borrowing. 

## Risk Analysis:
**GHST Overall Risk is: B**

### Smart Contract Risk: B-
Maturity: 333 Days (Deployed on 9/14/2020)
Transactions: 1,274,683

### Counterparty Risk: B+
Holders: 17,018 (Ethereum: 5854, Polygon: 8481, Stakers: 2683)
Permission: Permissionless 

### Market Risk:  B

Market Cap: 130,000,000 
Average Volume:  $50,408,294
Normalized Volatility: 6%

**Overall Risk Score: B**

## Proposed Risk Parameters
Unlike most asset applications, we would like to propose two separate Risk Parameter options and allow the community to vote on their favorite. 

Option 1 is more conservative and in line with collaterals on the Aave Ethereum Market, while Option 2 is more liberal and similar to other collaterals on the Aave Polygon Market. 

Finally, we offer an option to only use GHST for borrowing, and an option to decline the listing completely. 

### Risk Parameters Option 1
LTV:  25%
Liquidation Threshold: 45%
Liquidation Bonus: 12.5%*
Reserve Factor: 20%

### Risk Parameters Option 2
LTV:  50%
Liquidation Threshold: 65%
Liquidation Bonus: 12.5%*
Reserve Factor: 20%

*In their recent report, Gauntlet suggested using max 12.5% LB

## Summary
Aave Arc is a “permissioned” version of the software underlying V2 of the Aave protocol that employs an additional smart contract layer to only allow “whitelisted” or “permissioned” users to engage with the protocol.

Fireblocks asks the Aave Governance community to approve the appointment, adoption, and authorization of Fireblocks LLC, a Fireblocks company, as a “whitelister” for one or more deployments of Aave Arc.

## Proposal
Fireblocks is on a mission to bring more institutional participants into DeFi.

Today, Fireblocks serves more than 600 customers and has secured over $1.25 trillion in digital assets. Fireblocks’ technology has become trusted by the leading institutional crypto players and the world’s biggest banks to secure digital assets, develop new yield generating strategies, and improve capital efficiency. As the initial whitelisting partner for Aave Arc, Fireblocks can offer institutions the same secure and scalable rails used to transfer and store digital assets to access permissioned DeFi environments.

DeFi is considered by institutional users to be one of the more complex markets to navigate across security, compliance, and risk perspectives. We are eager to be at the forefront of this transformational opportunity with Aave Arc by extending access to even our most compliance-conscious customers, who would otherwise avoid DeFi over compliance or regulatory concerns.

Fireblocks’ R&D, compliance, and legal teams have developed a new whitelister framework for permissioned DeFi. This framework meets both enterprise-grade requirements for accessing DeFi and adheres to Aave Arc’s whitelister governance criteria. This deployment will set the precedent for new organizations joining Aave Arc, simplify the process for onboarding new whitelisters, and ensure everyone is following best practices defined by the whitelister community.

A proposal to adjust twelve (12) total risk parameters across eight (8) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. 

## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

In addition, we propose to enable utilizing FEI as a collateral on Aave. The initial parameters for FEI will be an LTV of 50%, a Liquidation Threshold of 60%, and a Liquidation Bonus of 6.5%. Most of the stablecoins that can be used as collateral are more liquid, and our platform's analysis recommends initially capping the amount of collateral that can be liquidatable to the average daily trading volume. If user behavior and market conditions over the coming months continue to show safe conditions for increasing capital efficiency on FEI, we shall recommend ramping up the LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus incrementally.


## Specification

This past week did not see outsized changes in market conditions nor within the Aave protocol. There were slight volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets. Our platform recommends the following set of parameter changes that will decrease liquidation bonuses on several less-utilized assets.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAL Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |
| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |

| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |
| DPI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |
| ENJ Loan To Value    | 60%     | 70%     |
| FEI Loan To Value    | 0%     | 50%     |

## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust thirteen (13) total risk parameters across nine (9) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus.



## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters based on previously selected community risk level preferences. First, a continuation of the two previous liquidation bonus updates, [AIP-34: Liquidation Bonus Updates](https://app.aave.com/governance/30-QmccRszk94JUyj3xGcBUxUzCo43jZDQYgesEULsudVjm9v) and [AIP-38: Liquidation Bonus Updates for Eleven Aave V2 Assets](https://app.aave.com/governance/38-QmciauyTVnoHG6bAXCxHjHqTsUfiDz7rSGFxMADqFgCh4z). Second, updated LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters to realign with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the community. 

## Motivation

This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. While increased volatility affected most assets in the ecosystem, some tail assets experienced even higher volatility and larger collateral usage (supply that is significantly borrowed against). In addition, increased liquidity and decreased trading slippage for certain assets allow for lower liquidation bonuses.

Paragraph Summary

Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets.

All art assets and Axie genetic data can be easily accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their own tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe.

While still in early access, Axie is ranked the #1 Ethereum game by daily, weekly, and monthly active users. It has generated over 13,000 ETH in revenue (16M+ USD) so far.

Motivation

Add $AXS as a lending currency into Aave money markets.

**Axie Infinity Shards(AXS) are an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie Universe. **

Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?
By listing $AXS you will be able to leverage an entire nation of gamers.

Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?
**
** Version 1 First half 2021 / Staking dashboard released
AXS holders can stake their tokens through the staking dashboard and participate in governance votes brought forward by the Sky Mavis team.

These votes will revolve around which teams should receive funding from the ecosystem fund, and how the Community treasury should be distributed.

Version 2 - Early 2022

More on-chain votes about smaller issues.

Potentially changing the way votes are being counted from 1 token 1 vote to Quadratic voting.

Version 3 - September 2023 / Decentralized Organization

AXS holders determine which governance framework should be used and how much should be voted on. Some decisions will not be up for debate such as token supply which is iron-clad in smart contracts.

Potential things that can be voted on:

Should Axie Infinity Limited continue to pay Sky Mavis to develop Axie Infinity?

Should Axie Infinity use the marketplace created by Sky Mavis?

How should the Community Treasury be used to reward AXS holders and the broader Axie community?

Should the Community Treasury funds be attached to any yield farming/staking services such as Yearn.finance or Rari.Capital?

How is the asset currently used?
*. In early 2021, the Community Treasury went live. The Community Treasury began to receive revenues generated by Axie Infinity as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury is by AXS stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. A more detailed overview of the Treasury can be found here 3.

The token has been designed in collaboration with Delphi Digital.
6. Emission schedule
AXS will be unlocked in a pre-determined schedule which lasts for 65 months from the public sale. The initial circulating supply is set to 59,985,000 AXS - 22.22% of the total supply.

AIP-23 which aimed to add BarnBridge’s BOND token for deposit/lending as well as collateral failed to pass. This proposal is similar to AIP-23 but removes the BOND as collateral aspect. 
Rationale
The primary concern leading to the failure of AIP-23 is low on-chain liquidity of the BOND token. As such this proposal removes the ability to utilize BOND as collateral while still allowing deposits and lending. As on-chain liquidity improves an additional proposal can be made to allow BOND as collateral. The BarnBridge community has provided significant TVL to Aave. Continued collaboration would be mutually beneficial. 

It appears Arthur_0x supports this approach. (https://twitter.com/Arthur_0x/status/1422939495838621700?s=20)

Proposal: Modify the borrow/deposit rewards split for each asset to dynamically adjust based on the utilization rate. Each asset in AAVE has an optimal utilization rate (https://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/borrow-interest-rate#interest-rate-model). By skewing the deposit/borrow rewards depending on the current utilization compared to optimal, it will incentivize AAVE users to push interest rates towards a stable equilibrium.

Given that the optimal utilization rate is set lower for non-stablecoins, this model can be applied to these assets as well.

## Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. In addition, we propose freezing the KNCL reserve.


## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.


## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.


## Specification

The recent market downturn on the weekend of December 4th led to the most liquidations on both centralized exchanges and in liquidity protocols in the recent past. Most liquidations on the Aave protocol happened between 4:30 and 5:45 UTC when the price of ETH dropped nearly 13%. Below is a graph of liquidation by collateral and repay asset.
![Liquidations by collateral and repay asset](https://i.imgur.com/gDTtU13.png)
Although volatility for assets is slightly higher, the abundance of liquidity and active market participants is a positive sign for the health of Aave! For example, the total value of CRV (curve dao token) liquidated was large compared to the total collateral used on Aave. Lower LTV, lower liquidation threshold, and higher liquidation bonus protect the protocol from insolvencies. However, multiple liquidations of over 400,000 USD occured in quick succession. This shows ample liquidity for liquidators even in times of high network congestion. These market events provide important data points for measuring tail risk.

For reference, previous analysis of liquidations on Aave from May 2021 can be found here: https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/aave-protocol-liquidation-retrospective-may-2021-67c655fc1b31

Although some assets currently have higher volatility, our analysis shows that it is safe to increase borrowing parameters and decrease liquidation bonus values. Our simulations study price drops and network congestion more extreme than was seen last week, and slippage and liquidity considerations have improved.

| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BAT Loan To Value     | 70%     | 75%     |
| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |
| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |
| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 60%     |
| REN Liquidation Threshold     | 60%     | 65%     |
| SNX Loan To Value    | 30%     | 40%     |
| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 55%     | 60%     |
| SUSHI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |
| ZRX Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |

**Freezing KNCL**
The KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://www.notion.so/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://www.notion.so/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.

Considering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.

A proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across four (4) Aave V2 assets. 



## Abstract
This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV and ENJ.** The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. 



## Motivation


This set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.

Gauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. 

For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).

## Notable Accounts to Flag

As of 8/3/2022, the data shows that no accounts would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on the forum post.




## Risk Dashboard



The community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).

Value at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. 

Liquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.

Add a disclaimer to the borrower user interface, notifying users that governance can change parameter values which may alter their account health.

### Motivation

The governance process results in parameter changes of numerous kinds, including changes that impact account health factors. For example, the community has recently aligned on a [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding reducing liquidation thresholds. 

One way to increase transparency for Aave users is by adding a disclaimer in the borrow user interface. Since not all users may be aware that there is a governance process to change parameters or of the potential impact of governance decisions, it is valuable to make this information salient. Without this disclaimer, a user might believe that only price fluctuations impact their account health.

### Specification

# Paragraph summary
We would like to ask for your support in listing RSR (Reserve Rights Token) as an asset to borrow. RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both (a) insures and (b) governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol.

# Motivation
The Reserve team is launching the Reserve protocol in fall of 2022. From that point on, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token will serve the purpose of (a) insuring and (b) governing stablecoins created on the Reserve protocol (RTokens).

The Reserve protocol [GitHub - reserve-protocol/protocol](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/) is building on Aave by (a) integrating aTokens as collateral and (b) using the protocol oracle to determine price during valuation and auction functions (if listed on Aave as borrowable asset).

We would prefer to use the Aave oracles for the simplicity of our protocol’s design and the code has already been included in our ongoing audit. To do so, this requires RSR to be a borrowable asset on Aave.

When RSR is staked on a particular Reserve stablecoin (RToken), it may receive a portion of income from the respective RToken’s full collateral basket. Because of this, we anticipate demand to borrow RSR in order to stake or hedge staked positions. Aave would be the only platform where this would be possible as of now.

![image](ipfs://bafkreiaxl7iig3h3eceftb6qulbqugv52vmwndiv6da44y7zb6lrre6ole)
The Reserve app is currently available in Latin American countries where hyperinflation has had the most significant impact: Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia & Panama. It currently has >600,000 registered users and ~120,000 weekly app visitors who use the Reserve stablecoin(s) for daily purchases such as paying for groceries, paying bills, etc. This video shows how some of our customers use our stablecoin daily (https://tinyurl.com/mudrhh4d).

The Reserve Rights (RSR) token is the governance token used to insure the stable+ cryptocurrencies against collateral defaults, and while staked, is also used to govern the RTokens (collateral changes, etc).

A key point is that when RSR is staked on a particular RToken, it will typically (% determined by governance) receive a portion of the income of the entire RToken’s collateral.

(**) We define an asset as stable+ if it never depreciates, and generally appreciates over time, relative to its backing asset(s).

## Why would RSR be a good borrow asset?
We anticipate that the yield on stRSR will drive demand to borrow RSR for two primary purposes: (a) to hedge against price changes on an existing stRSR position and (b) to borrow with intent to stake for the stRSR yield.

These are both well known strategies in DeFi and TradFi, and we don’t expect that to be any different with RSR. Furthermore, we have received a significant amount of requests from our community, but have delayed on making this request until we were closer to launching our platform.

Aave would be the first and currently, only, place to borrow RSR in DeFi and as a result, we anticipate there to be demand.

By listing RSR as a borrowable asset, Aave would become the first DeFi protocol that allows borrowing RSR and could therefore benefit from the borrowing demand from the RSR community and potentially other parties.

## Brief history of the project’s components
The main relevant components of the Reserve ecosystem are the Reserve mobile app and the Reserve Protocol.

The Reserve app has been fully open access to users in the aforementioned countries since September 2021. The full version of the Reserve protocol will be live sometime in 2022. We anticipate this happening in the early Fall, although as with all development work, this could be a bit sooner or later.

An initial concept of fully collateralized stablecoins was launched in 2019, and since then the team has been working on the fully decentralized and permissionless platform that will allow for the creation of fully collateralized, yield bearing, and insured stablecoins. Full details on this updated version can be found here: [Protocol description - Reserve](https://reserve.org/protocol/2021_version/).

## How is the asset currently used?
At this point in time the Reserve Rights (RSR) token serves as a placeholder token. From this year onward, the token will be used for two main purposes:
1. RSR holders can stake their RSR on any Reserve stablecoin (RToken) to insure it against default of one of the collateral tokens and in return, may receive a portion of the yield generated by the collateral backing RTokens.
2. RSR holders can govern Reserve stablecoin to help decide on its future (e.g. collateral assets, back-up assets, locking periods, etc).
## Emission schedule
The total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens, out of which there are currently 18.3b in circulation. The remaining 81.7b RSR tokens are locked. Out of these, 49.4b tokens belong to the Slow Wallet, 15.5b to seed investors and strategic partners and 16.8b to team members and advisors.

The [Slow Wallet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70?a=0x6bab6EB87Aa5a1e4A8310C73bDAAA8A5dAAd81C1) is a locked wallet controlled by the Reserve project, used to fund RToken adoption initiatives like listings, partnerships, marketing, etc. It’s under the discretionary control of the Reserve team. However, it has a hard-coded 4-week delay after initiating each withdrawal transaction on the blockchain. Upon initiating a withdrawal transaction, the team announces the purpose of the withdrawal either through a public on-chain message or on social media. If RSR holders do not agree with the purpose of the withdrawal, they are able to sell their RSR in the 4-week period before the project is able to sell what they have withdrawn. The team can only access these withdrawn tokens after those 4 weeks.

More details here: [Release schedule](https://reserve.org/protocol/rsr_release_schedule/#main-content)

## Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?
The total supply of RSR cannot be changed. RSR did migrate from a V1 contract in the past, and some RSR has not completed the migration yet. The only minting that occurs is from migration (which does not impact total supply).

The contract is un-upgradeable, however it is pausable. The pauser is set to the [Reserve team multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xA7b123D54BcEc14b4206dAb796982a6d5aaA6770/home), a 3-of-5 safe. Pausing will only be done in situations where the token or platform is in danger. Once the platform has reached steady state, the team intends to release pausing to a burn address.

* The gas optimization contribution that has taken place continues to serve and save users a significant amount of funds for gas fees on a daily basis, so far as of 4th February, it has saved 80+ETH (which is 5.5% of the 3 years staking period) and expected to save a total of 1450ETH+ in the total 3 years staking period, please refer to the Dune dashboard.
* This proposal aims to review the proposed reward for AIP 161, the feedback from the community was eye opening and insightful to shape the current proposal.
* In summary, back when the staking contract was being audited through AIP34, I found multiple gas optimizations findings, which were shared with Immunefi and classified as out of scope, since they are only concerned about security findings. thereafter, due to the time scarcity to form an AIP and wait for it to pass to implement the gas optimizations and the mainnet launch was in the following 2-3 weeks. I decided to get it implemented by reaching out to Horizen Labs. which they were happy about the findings and implemented the findings at the last moments.

417,669,1522,1522,1522,2023-11-09 02:05:44+00:00,apecoin,"##### ABSTRACT
The purpose of this proposal is to give voting rights back to the broader ApeCoinDAO community and its delegations for Working Group Steward positions.

The Ape Assembly was established as a Governance Working Group Initiative outlined in AIP-239, aiming to facilitate Working Group Steward elections. However, with as few as twenty active voters in recent weeks, there are growing concerns about the legitimacy that those elections would carry. Furthermore, we need Stewards who have experience in conducting significant outreach within the ApeCoin DAO community, which only DAO-wide campaigns can provide.

Currently, there will be four new Stewards elected in the upcoming Metaverse and Marketing and Communications Working Group elections scheduled to commence Nov 1, 2023, with approval to execute critical functions for the DAO moving forward.

To address these issues and enhance overall voting participation, this proposal recommends shifting future Working Group Steward elections from the Ape Assembly to a tried and true DAO-wide voting structure.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
This AIP benefits the ApeCoin ecosystem by ensuring that Working Groups meet their mandates of providing critical functions and services to the DAO, and continuing to provide a voice for the broader ApeCoin DAO community through their ability to vote, while maintaining consistency with all other elections.

This AIP adheres to the DAO’s values of Collective Responsibility and Boldness by taking decisive action to address this issue of representation in Working Group Steward elections, and working towards progress over perfection.

Concerns about low voter turnout and election legitimacy have been raised, with the argument that DAO-wide campaigns are necessary to find experienced Stewards. The proposed solution is to shift future Working Group Steward elections from the Ape Assembly to a broader DAO-wide voting structure. This move aims to increase overall participation and ensure representation for the broader community. The proposal aligns with the DAO's values of Collective Responsibility and Boldness, and it carries no cost.",bullish,small

Beyond the SWAMP aims to produce a vibrant, high-quality collectible bimonthly magazine claimed through the sale of accompanying NFTs displaying each issue’s cover art—similar to Punks comic but with varying rarity and added rewards. Aside from columns featuring news and difference makers from outside of our ecosystem, content will focus on the ApeCoinDAO, ApeCoinDAO-led initiatives, successful ApeCoinDAO AIPs, and ApeCoin use cases; Yuga Labs and the growing number of projects under their umbrella; brands utilizing holder IP; diversity within regional meetup groups; female collectors; augmented reality through a sponsorship with [Art House](https://www.arthouse.ar/); gaming; art, tech and blockchain. All primary sales will be conducted in APE, contributors will be paid in APE and any future revenue raised from in-magazine advertising will be received in APE.

Our mission is to create an onramp into the ApeCoin and Yuga Labs ecosystems while strengthening ties between existing communities. We will take an ethical approach to journalism, provide culture-driven meaningful content, and act as a springboard for existing and up-and-coming artists. Our team is made up by a creative director with a history in bookmaking alongside a team of illustrators and graphic designers.

We also want to further-facilitate artists by providing interview space and fair compensation for cover art. Additional features include spotlights on active community members; regional BAYC groups like Bored Club Canada, TaiwanDAO, FrenchApeYC and associations like PinkDAO; women in the space; Blender tips and tech talk; metaverse; memes; music and photography; generative artwork; Meebin with the Meebits; Mutants are INSANE; Mutant Cartel and the Mutant Hounds; Cryptopunks and Cryptopunks history; 10ktf; interviews; features on ApeCoinDAO Special Council members and Stewards; discussions with founders; security tips; advertisements from brands utilizing holder IP (ApeWater, ForeverApes etc); gaming; as well as articles written by contributors sourced from projects like Nouns, Doodles, Gutter Cat Gang, Moonbirds, CloneX, and Deadfellaz. We will also be including advanced in-magazine AR capabilities to bring artwork, advertising and otherwise static NFTs to life triggered by QR codes.

Also important to note that as marketing in the NFT space shifts away from macro influencers we believe that providing community-driven content packaged in a collectible physical form will initiate broader trust from outsiders and better prepare them for onboarding. It should also be said that for some collectors, tangible products often feel longer lasting or more real than digital; particularly to those just entering the space. That being said many others prefer tokens, so keeping those community members in mind we want to include additional NFT packs based on Beyond the SWAMP NFT rarity.

Beyond the SWAMP is seeking a one-time grant for company development and first issue production. The layout of our magazine will be completed by a team of career creatives specializing in layout, illustration and graphic design. Beginning with an initial rollout of 350 copies, we will create an economy of scale increasing to 500 copies for our second issue and 750 copies from issues three to six totalling 3850 magazines in our first year at an average production cost of $13.63 per copy. Taking this approach will allow us to grow our readership cautiously during tumultuous market conditions while lowering the overall grant request and cost to the community. External services and service providers include advisors, legal, website builders, smart contract developer, audit team, printing and promotion.

In September 2022, NFTxExplore, a Ladies of BAYC member, teamed up with a friend and designed a web3 hackathon in Moldova where entrepreneurs created innovative business ideas using blockchain technology. The event received over 500 applications for 100 spots.

During the event, they introduced skills such as how to create a Smart contract, build community, and develop a DAO; NFTxExplore used the ApeDAO as an example and tapped into builders across web3 as mentors to lead virtual sessions. Teams pitched their business ideas, and the top three joined the HUG, a leading web3 incubator that supports early stage web3 businesses.

Check out these two videos about the event:

And 
[Se formează prima comunitate Web3 din Moldova - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlfhtSLHiT0)

This grant builds off of last year’s event, and will place $ApeCoin at the center of the experience. $Ape is designed to drive culture forward and as a tool for developers to participate in the ecosystem by incorporating $Ape into services, games, and projects.

NFTxExplore and her colleague will provide web3 learning experiences to spread the $Ape brand and position $ApeCoin at the forefront of web3 innovation and creativity. We’ll lead web3 learning experiences, invite $Ape mentors from the DAO to lead sessions, and create an onsite art installation as part of the 4-day experience.

The art installation will be in collaboration with another Ladies of BAYC member, artist Stella (@Stellitart), and local artists. As a part of this engagement, we will produce an art product available free to $Ape holders. We will also invite local and international media to cover the event and amplify the $Ape brand across web3.

We seek $28,400 USD.

This AIP aims to sponsor MOCA MONDAY Spaces and establish a rewarding vault for the community

With MOCA MONDAY we want to implement a Cross-Community focused Spaces to educate people of the Mocaverse, BAYC and Apecoin Community about general processes in the DAO, votings and explanations of AIPs.

With the raise of Mocaverse, one of the first Communities to delegate an amount of over 1.5 Million Apecoin, we think it became crucial and important to Build a Cross-Community focused Spaces where these Communities come together to learn about each others Culture and especially educate and learn about the ApecoinDAO in his mindset, the processes of participation, votings and inform about the actual AIPs and their content.

1.1 - Key Highlights

* Educate the Communities about the ApecoinDAO processes

* Weekly discussions about the content of ALL AIPs which are up for Voting

* Learn about participation in the ApecoinDAO

* Promote important Cross-Community News & informations

* Higher participation in the ApecoinDAO, the Ape Assembly and the Mocaverse DAO

* Increase the knowledge of all Holders about BAYC, Apecoin, Yugalabs and their Ecosystem.

1.2 - Allocation

Allocation: The funds will be divided into two essential areas:

1. Community Engagement: A portion of the funds will be used to purchase exciting prizes to boost community engagement. This will help us build strong connections between the growing MOCA DAO, Apecoin DAO, and the broader community.

2. Production Enhancement: The other part of the funds will be invested in elevating the production value of these spaces. This includes improvements in editing, distribution, delegation, and marketing.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

The creation of Apeverse, a multi-language information hub, is aimed at streamlining the dissemination of information and promoting community engagement within the rapidly expanding Ape ecosystem. As the Ape community continues to grow, there is a growing need for a platform that offers readily accessible information on the latest developments, data, and activities within the ecosystem.

Beyond serving as an information resource, Apeverse also functions as a platform where community members can interact and collaborate, thereby fostering a sense of unity and facilitating growth. It keeps track of dynamic changes relating to Apecoin and Ape-associated NFTs, and provides data analysis to illustrate the ecosystem’s progress, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability within the community.

Apeverse surpasses language barriers to become an essential hub for information delivery, given the rich array of information the Ape community encounters daily but lacks a singular space to consolidate it efficiently. Therefore, Apeverse is seen as a key resource for the community, facilitating greater inclusivity and communication efficiency within the diverse global Ape ecosystem.

This proposal is for receiving financial support from the APECoin DAO for Ape Drops. The project’s goal is to become a curated NFT platform for the Ape community. At full operational capacity, Ape Drops will release multiple curated NFT drops a week from the best designers and musicians in the space. Funds will go towards building a larger team and financing NFT drops and events with high profile artists. We will only receive funds from the DAO when we reach key milestones.

NFTeams has been building out its ecosystem for the past 2 years. We have built an entire sporting ecosystem (Teams, Jerseys, and now Players) and are ready to mint the players and start on the game.

This proposal’s main aims are:

1. Make NFTeams the Sporting League of Otherside
2. Move NFTeams to an Apecoin Standard
3. Give 5,000 Player NFTs to $APE and BAYC ecosystem (free mint)

This proposal aims to move the NFTeams ecosystem to an Apecoin standard, while also giving 5,000 Player NFTs as a free mint to $APEcoin and BAYC ecosystem holders (via mini-games)

The goal of NFTeams is to create the sporting leagues of the Otherside. We have already created 10,000 teams and jerseys and given away over $200,000 USD in prizes.

Our next step is to release our 10,000 Players that will compete in games each day.

**[This promo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi40iDJo47g&ab_channel=NFTeams)** will give a good idea of what we want to eventually have running in Otherside.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

* Bring in 500-1000 new $APE holders from the current NFTeams ecosystem
* Potential for new $APE holders who want to win a free Player NFT
* Show a use case for $APE (prize money, player training, tournament entry)
* New content for Otherside (Sporting events, Player backstories)
* Use case for Otherdeeds (sporting stadiums)(Sporting equipment made from resources)
* Always on worldwide sport (running 24/7)
* Showing other projects how to move to $ApeCoin Standard.

#### OVERALL COST

$500,000 USD in $APE

You could see this as the DAO paying $100 (~0.05 ETH) for each Player given away + all the extra benefits.

80% of the $APE will stay as $APE and be staked and used for prizemoney. The current community fund will be converted to fund the ongoing build.

Also note: $280,000 was spent on Player creation and tooling (which is not a cost being paid for via this proposal).

427,683,1563,1563,1563,2024-05-16 19:37:16+00:00,apecoin,"##### ABSTRACT
The following is a proposed guidelines and clarity for the how ApeCoin DAO is to conduct a Request for Proposals (henceforth known as RFP).

The recent [ApeChain RFP](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/apechain-request-for-proposals/21139) has brought forth a need to adequately explain the conditions and rules governing how an RFP is to be conducted, under what circumstances, and what the voting structure is.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
As best understood, there have been three executed RFPs in ApeCoin DAO History:
* [An RFP in response to AIP-21 and AIP-22](https://twitter.com/apecoin/status/1550616722809536512), in which Horizen Labs was selected.
* An [RFP for selecting a Cayman Islands Administrator](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0x5222214e742168df0297589a78b3bd346159fe88f89f536d4f273fe315f23c8c) as a result of [AIP-196](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-196-bored-aip-bringing-order-and-reliability-via-ecosystem-decentralization/10160) that was approved and explicitly stated that it would perform said RFP.
* The [ApeChain RFP](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/apechain-request-for-proposals/21139). While the RFP retroactively had the [ApeChain Poll/Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xe26b5ec8c8d1d03c9ba5b4c53e8d9aa1dc38d2f4b6c44dd9c41643b11fb2b645) to decide if the [ApeChain RFP vote](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xff1829f8e2fb778946ef83050858a54582da50da3de3acb67c74f5e38c1da0aa) would proceed, it still carried the same weight of whether the ApeChain RFP vote would proceed.

It was during the ApeChain RFP that the community realized that we do not have a proper framework and a understanding of the RFP process and that needed to change. As such this AIP is designed to inform the community and those who wish to pursue an RFP the steps necessary to conduct one.


##### OVERALL COST 
The overall cost for this proposal is expected to be zero.

As noted in the Steps to Implement, in the event of an accepted RFP Recommendation, the Foundation would be required to set aside the requested maximum budget (as specified in the “Budget Range” of the RFP Recommendation). Any excess funds not ultimately awarded to the accepted vendor are to be returned to the Treasury.

TL;DR - ApeCoin DAO needs professional Marketing, PR & Communications. This charter details what an initial infrastructure could/should entail, provides foundational branding support & IP usage guidelines, and creates an environment for the majority of initiatives to spring forth from the community.

The goal of this proposal is to help establish the ApeCoin DAO Marketing and Communications Working Group. The Marketing and Communications Working Group’s mandate is to:

“Propose a consistent and compelling brand strategy and identity for the ApeCoin DAO, propose and implement comprehensive marketing and communications strategies, and help establish a strong presence through effective global communication efforts in order to onboard more users into the DAO.”

Working Groups enable a sustainable community-led infrastructure that further decentralizes the DAO, creates operational efficiency, and is flexible enough to adapt to any opportunities that may arise. The guidelines for how this Working Group will function are proposed in AIP-239.

#### OVERALL COST

* This AIP serves as an initial framework to establish this Working Group. The three elected Stewards will propose a budget 1-3 weeks after being onboarded.

This vote is to choose the Cayman Islands Administrator(s) for the APE Foundation.

The available options reflect the service providers who chose to apply for the Request for Proposal (RFP) advertised here: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/request-for-proposal-cayman-islands-administrator-for-the-ape-foundation/11051

This RFP was administered by Working Group Zero (WG0), with support from the ApeCoin Special Council. Via AIP-196, the ApeCoin DAO empowered WG0 to administer the RFP and bring the selection decision to a DAO-wide vote.

The DAO must choose between two new potential APE Foundation Administrators:

- WebSlinger
- Autonomous + Lemma + Provenance

#### WG0 STEWARDS ANALYSIS

Following multiple meetings with all parties and careful consideration of the four proposals received, the WG0 Stewards believe WebSlinger to be the best choice for the next administrator of the APE Foundation. While both groups are competent and accomplished – WebSlinger’s breadth of background, CFO services provided by a global entity, desire to help decentralize DAO operations, and extensive experience in the Crypto / Web3 / DAO environment were the key differentiating factors in our choice.

With NFT Embed, ApeCoin DAO can own the marketplace of choice for ecosystem assets and other curated projects. NFT Embed is a free tool from Graviton, providing Shopify and Stripe functionality for NFTs. NFT Embed is free to use; Graviton will deploy an initial marketplace for ApeCoin DAO.

Marketplace fee: 0.30%, including a 0.30% base fee and a 0.00% finder’s fee. The finder’s fee amount and recipient is customizable, by collection, and can be ‘turned on’ when ApeCoin DAO has infrastructure and processes to accept revenue.

NFT Embed is powered by Universe’s decentralized, open-source, audited 1 2 marketplace that supports any collection and major tokens including $APE. Building with trustless, customizable solutions mitigates counter-party risks and compounds economic benefits attributable to marketplace ownership.

#### OVERALL COST 

NFT Embed is free to use.

Upon approval, Graviton has committed to providing and managing a domain for this marketplace, which will be communicated to ApeCoin DAO upon release. The marketplace will support Ecosystem assets (for those collections that are released before the marketplace is live), as defined, and launch with the 0.30% marketplace fee and 0% finder’s fee.

439,699,1606,1606,1606,2024-08-16 00:50:04+00:00,apecoin,"### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION

This proposal is for the creation of a 15M $APE multi-sig “Community Voting Wallet” controlled by members of the DAO community.

The purpose is for the CVW to be the voting voice of the community without the influence of whale wallets which tend to override the wishes of the community whereby whale wallets vote against the community pulse.

This mechanic will require a temp check voting period during which the “pulse” of the voting community is based on a “1 wallet = 1 vote” linear voting Snapshot recipe. The results of this voting temp check then determines how the community CVW votes on proposals.

The period of the delegated wallet will last for a period of ONE YEAR (term) from the date that the wallet is used to vote in any AIP. The term can be renewed if a member puts up an AIP to extend it before the term ends. The newly created delegation cannot be used to vote in any subsequent vote concerning its own delegation (e.g., a vote to renew, a vote to end the delegation early, etc.).

**Background Overview**

- Despite the size of the ApeCoin community, a few whale (1M+ $APE) wallets control the outcome of most proposals up for vote.

- In fact, the majority of token holders don’t actually participate in the DAO voting system.

- The voting turnout continues to decline because, as in real-life, the general consensus among voters is that they can’t be bothered because they know that their vote isn’t likely to count.

- In the June 2024 period alone, the average voting turnout for all AIPs was **189** (!)

- The introduction of the Horizen wallet in the voting system last October has thus far created a polarizing effect whereby, at **4.3M $APE**, it is now the 2nd largest voting wallet next to the Mocaverse (delegated by Animoca) at **6.3M $APE**. And due to the turnout of the voters, these two wallets control the outcome for **every vote** in the DAO.

- The effects of whale voting wallets controlling the outcome of the DAO voting is a centralized paradigm that is outside the realms of decentralization, trust, and fairness.

- Putting caps on a voting wallet isn’t the answer as that will just lead to Sybil solutions whereby that same wallet can be split into amounts below the cap, then all vote anyway.

- The Ape Foundation, acting at the behest of the DAO, has an obligation to ensure that each member of the DAO has a voice, and that the voting system is fair and equitable to all.

### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
This initiative ensures that the DAO community voting, via this proposal, is fairly representative of the wishes of the community.

It can also dramatically reduce - even eliminate - the influence of whale wallets in the DAO voting system.

This community temp check Snapshot voting system is similar to the [For|Against ApeChain](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xe26b5ec8c8d1d03c9ba5b4c53e8d9aa1dc38d2f4b6c44dd9c41643b11fb2b645) vote which came ahead of the final AIP vote for the selected team to build ApeChain.

This proposal introduces a strategic alliance between Eesee, a gamified NFT platform, and ApeCoin DAO. The partnership is designed to democratize access to high-value NFTs, stimulate community interaction, and inspire active involvement in ApeCoin governance, and enhance the visibility of ApeCoin’s sub-communities.

#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM

The proposed partnership will provide ApeCoin DAO and its sub-communities with the opportunity to tap into Eesee’s growing user base, a demographic that is deeply interested in NFT trading. Additionally, the proposal aims to build a deeper connection between our two communities through exclusive NFT drops, special events, and educational quests.

These quests, inspired by “Coinbase Earn”, will provide engaging and educational content about ApeCoin and its sub-communities. The introduction of educational quests will encourage ApeCoin holders to learn more about the ApeCoin ecosystem, participate in governance, and contribute to the community. Upon completion, users will be rewarded with dynamic NFT badges that not only serve as a token of achievement but also provide access to exclusive content or events.

For instance, these badges could be used for token-gating, where only holders of certain level badges (e.g., Level 3 ApeCoin badge holders) can participate in specific raffles. This mechanism encourages active involvement and learning within the ApeCoin ecosystem, while also bringing attention to the sub-communities.

Also, the quests will include updates from the sub-communities, inspiring participants to interact more actively with these platforms and join their Twitter spaces. This approach will help to democratize access to high-value NFTs, cultivate a more vibrant, engaged community, and increase governance participation.

#### OVERALL COST

As this proposal does not involve a funding request, there is no associated cost to the ApeCoin DAO. The implementation will be carried out by the Eesee team.

451,715,1669,1669,1669,2024-05-02 20:54:56+00:00,apecoin,"##### ABSTRACT
How would you like to own a piece of the rights to the Joe Rogan’s podcast or the kids show Bluey? That’s what we’re aiming to create with ApeCoin.

We’re seeking funding to produce audiovisual content in both English AND Spanish, telling stories across various successful genres that resonate with a wide audience. In doing so, we’re not just looking to generate financial benefits for ApeCoin holders by tokenizing these rights; but it’ll also crack open a whole new market: the massive and untapped Spanish-speaking world.

And this project not only grants current worldwide ApeCoin holders (and thus ApeCoin DAO members) the right to a proportional share of the IPs and their future earnings, but it also opens up new possibilities for:

a)⁠ ⁠Creative professionals and spanish speaking audiences who hadn’t previously considered ApeCoin among their crypto options, who will now be exposed to it through the development and publishing of the IPs.

b)⁠ ⁠Current ApeCoin holders, who are encouraged to increase their holdings to boost their returns through this dual opportunity.

c)⁠ ⁠Furthermore, as all podcasts funded by this AIP will carry the ApeCoin brand, it naturally draws in new potential buyers, spotlighting mass-consumption content to push ApeCoin into the mainstream.

We expect that this move will expand the APE ecosystem to larger audiences interested in investing and Web3, thereby increasing its recognition and value for all.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
* The APE Community will own 50% of the IPs (including all derivatives, ancillary, royalties and direct income) funded through this AIP; the remaining 50% will be owned by DIXO (25%) and Medios Modernos (25%). By “APE Community,” we specifically refer to the ApeCoin DAO and its members. This community is at the core of our proposal and its intended benefits.
* With respect to the aforementioned “direct income,” our priority is to first return value back to the Treasury (full $380,050 from gross revenue). We’ll then proceed with the distribution based on the 50-25-25 split among the ApeCoin DAO, Dixo, and Medios Modernos. This is intended to ensure that all parties benefit fairly and equitably in the evolving landscape of decentralization (a philosophy we fully support).
* While it’s tough to pin down exact timelines before the project kicks off, drawing from our prior experience, we are confident that revenue generation will begin within a year after the release of any podcast under this AIP and possibly less. As an additional note, we are already in talks for a first-look contract with an L.A.-based audiovisual production companies regarding these IPs.
* Exclusive content to help evangelize and promote APE, Blockchain and Web3 principles and uses.
* Every podcast episode, will include a mention of the APE Foundation/ApeCoin DAO.
* Products or Brands accepting ApeCoin and/or Accepted AIP Authors will have a free 20-second spot (as long as the product and/or brand is compliant with the APE Foundation guidelines).
* Products that aren’t accepting ApeCoin but have a direct relation with the ApeCoin DAO will have a 70% discount of market price (as long as the product and/or brand is compliant with the APE Foundation guidelines). What we’re proposing here is to offer any member of the ApeCoin DAO the opportunity to promote, sell, market, or sponsor their products or services—with a 70% discount of the current ad CPM [cost-per-mille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_mille) market price.
* After reviewing AIP-274, we’d certainly like to include the “Powered by ApeCoin” logo on the cover art of every IP funded by this AIP, as well as an audio “Powered by ApeCoin” voiceover at the end of each podcast episode, as a part of the credits. This ensures a consistent and visible partnership branding across all media.
* A real opportunity to create a highly successful and highly profitable worldwide franchise, both in the entertainment industry and in Web3.
* Future tokenization of IPs that can spinoff to other media, products and entertainment categories that help ApeCoin have a wider use and grow in value.

##### OVERALL COST 
TOTAL: $380,050 USD
Budget of 4 IPs:

This proposal aims to allocate 13.8 Million ApeCoin in voting power to better reflect the contributions and stakes of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), Kodas, and Otherdeed holders within our community. We aim to create a more balanced and representative governance. We aim to create two distinct wallets; one for the monkees and one for the Kodas and the Deeds they keep watch over.

The Ape Wallet will have 6.9 million ApeCoin delegated to it by The Ape Foundation. The vote will be controlled by BAYC (2 votes) and MAYC (1 vote) via snapshot.

The Otherside Wallet will have 6.9 million ApeCoin delegated to it and will be controlled by Koda (2 votes) and Otherdeed Expanded holders (1 vote)

- _This delegation will have a one-year term starting from the date that the wallets are used to vote in any AIP. The term can be renewed if a member puts up an AIP to extend it before the term ends. However, these delegations will not be used to vote in any subsequent decisions related to them, such as renewing, extending, or ending it early._


### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The proposed voting adjustment aims to empower those who were intended to lead The Otherside. This change is designed to foster a fairer voting environment, promoting decisions that benefit the broader community and support the long-term health of the ecosystem.

This proposal aims to expand the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem through the creation of an animated series pilot and three spin-off comic books, featuring characters owned by ApeCoin DAO holders. We envision a gritty, action-packed, and comedic, anime-inspired adaptation of the American Ape comic book series that prominently features ApeCoin as the primary currency of the Metaverse, reaching beyond the echo chamber of “Crypto Twitter” that is primed to be pitched directly to international streamers via our producing team’s existing development, production and distribution pipelines.

The team is requesting $300,000 USD in $APE to produce the animated series pilot and three (3) spin-off comics, expanding the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem’s lore and raising awareness of the ApeCoin ecosystem through an ongoing mainstream animated television show and secure an international distribution deal for the comic books.

This proposal aims to bring ApeCoin to thousands of new holders and encourage community engagement with an interactive, gamified experience based on exploring the real world.

Dropverse is a platform for geolocation-based NFT drops. We’re building Pokémon Go for NFTs. We drop digital collectibles - including mint passes, NFTs redeemables, tokens, and more in both fixed physical locations and also spawned automatically around users’ geolocations. The platform serves as a medium for providing easy, fun, and interactive access to digital assets and exposure to Web3 to casual smartphone users.

The Special Council of the APE Foundation, at the behest of the ApeCoin DAO members, acts as a liaison between the ApeCoin DAO members and the directors and officers of the APE Foundation. The Special Council exists to serve the vision of ApeCoin DAO.

To further shape the success of the role long-term, the following changes are proposed to be made:
1. Clarify that the Special Council is an “Advisory Board’’ that serves an advisory function with no corporate decision-making power.
    * Rationale: Oftentimes there is quoted confusion in the community about what the Special Council is or is not. In practice, the Special Council is in fact an Advisory Board neither corporate officers nor management executives, and they should not be viewed as such. The Advisory Board should also not be misconstrued as the board of directors of the APE Foundation.
    * An effective advisory board member brings unique qualities to the table. Key qualities and characteristics that make an individual effective in this role: diverse knowledge base, proven familiarity and understanding of the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem, good judgment, thoughtfulness, communication skills, commitment, integrity, and team player abilities.
2. Special Council nominees must have been discourse members for at least 6-months prior to the commencement of the term for which they are running and must have achieved a minimum of Trust Level 2 on discourse. For example, a nominee for the Special Council must have been a discourse member by June 30, 2024 if they are running for the January 1, 2025 term.
    * Rationale: The primary responsibility of Special Council members is to conduct administrative review of AIPs. Accordingly, it is important for the DAO that the individuals elected to the Special Council have a strong history of participation in the discourse and with AIPs.
3. Removal of the weekly reports established by AIP-305.
    * Rationale: It was a good experiment, but the minimal engagement metrics of the reports has shown that they have not been an effective use of anyone’s time and efforts. Furthermore, such reports are not appropriate for advisory boards.


##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
Implementing the proposed changes could yield several benefits for the ApeCoin DAO and its governance structure:

Clarity: Renaming the Special Council to the “Advisory Board” clarifies its role and that it is distinct from corporate management and decision-making. This clarity can help ApeCoin DAO members and better understand the purpose and function of the board, leading to more focused discussions and decision-making processes.

Fit and Focus: Requiring nominees to have a history of discourse participation and familiarity with AIPs ensures that Advisory Board members are properly suited to their roles. This can result in more informed discussions, better decision-making, and increased trust from the community.

Overall, these changes aim to optimize the Advisory Board’s role within the ApeCoin DAO, promoting long-term sustainability, and efficiency.

##### OVERALL COST 
No ApeCoin requested from the treasury.

The expiration of the APE Foundation’s administrator contract for the second time in 2022 has magnified the need to develop internal capabilities and avoid reliance on any external resource that could result in a single point of failure in the DAO. This AIP represents progress over perfection – the only thing possible in this messy and amazing world of decentralized governance we love.

Compared to the costs of the previous version of this proposal – the above expenses represent a savings to the DAO of $372,812 over the 3-month period. It’s important to note that there will be other expenses related to WG0, but their allocation will be based fully on specific budget requests made by WG0 Stewards and subject to the approval of the Special Council.

#### OVERALL COST

The monthly cost for DAO Administrative Functions under this AIP are as below. All amounts are denominated in USD and payable in ApeCoin based on the previous 30-day average exchange rate. Any expenses beyond what are described below will not be allocated to Working Group Zero without approval of the Special Council:

Brinc is a global venture accelerator having invested in over 250 startups over the last 8 years with founders from more than 35 countries. Brinc is also a portfolio company of Animoca Brands. Brinc has a track record of 64 Web3 startups with a total of 10.5M USD investment deployed. From our Web3 investments, average post program funding equals 2.4M USD within 12 months for teams that have successfully raised. Based on our deep Web3 experience we propose launching the “Ape Builder House” to promote the use of ApeCoin integration into new and existing businesses. Unlike other events which give teams a maximum of 2-3 days of support, we propose a prize pool including $APE grants paired with acceptance to Brinc’s world class Web3 Accelerator providing additional education, mentorship and funding opportunities for winners.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The ApeCoin Builder House’s motivation is to provide the knowledge, resources, and mentorship for existing and new projects to integrate ApeCoin in a sustainable business. This combined with IRL events at two of the biggest Web3 conferences globally will build ecosystem awareness and utility for $APE. Our aim is for $APE to become a cornerstone fostering a growing entrepreneurial ecosystem unlocked through Brinc’s hands on support.

The Builder House will provide an opportunity for new and existing $APE holders, startups, and individual creators to launch a new idea or add to an existing business with the use of $APE. We understand that a startup journey extends far beyond a builder house which is why we will also offer winners an opportunity to join Brinc’s accelerator programs to drive long-term growth and value for the community. Over the past 9 years Brinc has hosted IRL events with thousands of attendees and helped hundreds of startups secure investment to scale.

How we support APE’s Mission and Guiding Values:
* Help $APE members with the business tools, knowledge and mentorship to bring their idea to life
* Support existing Web2 and Web3 businesses on how to integrate $APE
* Build awareness for $APE with IRL events at the biggest Web3 conferences
* Increase uses cases & utility for $APE
* Ultimately drive the value and utility of $APE
* Increase ApeCoin Holders
* Access to education, mentorship and investment opportunities for top projects post-builder house to drive long-term value and growth
* Follow-on co-investment opportunities for ApeCoin DAO to double down on Builder house winners

##### OVERALL COST 
Our recommendation is to move forward with an 12 month engagement, during which we will support and launch two Builder House events with ongoing support for winners to join Brinc’s Web3 Accelerator Program. This engagement can be renewed upon completion to run an additional two builder houses. From our experience, the 12 month engagement will give us enough time to validate the value of the engagement and quantify impact to ApeCoin DAO before extending or amending the agreement.

Builder House Setup Budget: USD $50,000 equivalent in $APE (Approximately 35,714 APE) (one time fee)

Phase 1 - Marketing Callout and Application Management Budget: USD $200,000 equivalent in $APE (Approximately 142,858 APE) (annual budget for two events)

Phase 2 - Builder House execution Budget: USD $250,000 equivalent in $APE (Approximately 178,572 APE) (annual budget for two events)

Phase 3 - Top 5 Winners per event join Brinc & Animoca Brands Web3 Accelerator (USD 350,000 Total - USD $35,000 per team) (Approximately 250,000 APE)

Builder House Prizes: 200,000 APE (2 events)

ApeCast, your app with and audio library full of curated X Spaces and ApeCoin-related recordings! Save time by searching for keywords and listening to specific segments. Read summaries of the audio in the language of your choice for quick overviews. This app will help you catch up on spaces, while not having to listen to the whole thing which can sometimes be 3+ hours!

ApeCast will be released for both iOS and Android.

APP FEATURES

Listening Library
This will be a part of the app that will contain spaces and recordings organized by source. This section will also contain searchable transcriptions for each episode and summaries. The summaries will be automatically translated into multiple languages as well. Other features include:
* Background listening
* Toggle marking an episode as listened
* Ability to subscribe to specific sources only
The downloaded audio will be minimally processed and uploaded. The goal here is to serve two types of users. The first archetype is the user who normally listens live but missed it this time. This would provide an organized way to listen in after the fact. The second archetype is the user who doesn’t have time to listen to a 90m+ episode but wants to listen to specific parts where “…” is mentioned. So they use the search feature to scrub the transcript and listen to just that part. We believe this is a powerful use case for listeners of long spaces.

Initially, we intend to support ApeComms spaces, MOCA town halls, and Ape Assembly Meetings. If the community wants us to support more, we are happy to add up to a total of five sources.

All the translations will be done automatically using an AI translation tool. Since most times it’s quite accurate, this should suffice to get the meaning across. The initial set of supported languages will be French, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish.

Creator Portal
Verified creators will have access to a backend that will allow them to upload audio for processing. They can also edit the transcripts and summaries. This will provide them with more control over their product. Where possible we will auto upload the audio.

##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM
The ApeCoin DAO is a collection of small communities with lots of overlap. Many different spaces hold discussions on AIPs but it’s difficult to keep up. It’s also annoying to search for a specific space from a previous week and listen. This app will improve ease of access, and create an archive of spaces and their transcripts. Those who don’t have a lot of time to quickly skim through the transcript can read the summary. We believe this will increase the number of people who engage in the ApeCoin ecosystem more regularly.

Translations and audio summaries can help expand our community. We have members from all over the world. While English may not be their first language, they spend a lot of time trying to understand what’s going on and be a part of the community. We believe in helping them along their journey.

##### OVERALL COST 
50000 APE
Payments will be made upon the completion of each milestone, except for the initial payment.

To produce 12 independent animations with a run time of 1 minute each.

This proposal introduces an ecosystem-wide casting call to all eligible IP Holders powered by ApeCoin. The animators of Atrium have experience with Disney, Pixar, HBO, Netflix & more and await the opportunity to co-create with community members. Funding this proposal showcases ApeCoin’s dedication to providing new avenues for creators and results in 12 animations under a “Legend of ApeCoin” theme.

Rationale of Value Added to ApeCoin

- In an increasingly digital landscape, content rules permanence and brand recall. Good brands build timeless content that fans can anchor on. That in turn creates an increasingly valuable ecosystem around it. As the canon storylines are created officially by Yuga, this proposal to the ApeCoin DAO community has a unique opportunity to co-create equally memorable characters and storylines that are completely driven bottoms-up.
- Being crypto native and having highly experienced talent from the animation industry (Pixar, Sony, Netflix, Dreamworks, Marvel), Atrium is uniquely positioned to work with ApeCoin DAO to create content that appeals to mainstream audience, bring more awareness to an already lovable crypto-native brand and deliver co-created cinematic content.

How does this benefit DAO + DAO members?

- ApeCoin DAO produces the storylines the community creates involving the ApeCoin brand.
- Co-create with crypto native network of qualified animators and filmmakers.
- Reinforces top of mind for community-produced content on all social channels (Atrium’s previously created content has recorded millions of impressions and hundreds of thousands of views in aggregate).
- Crypto native distribution mechanism of artifacts used in the production (content viewing, companion mints all made available free to the community members)

Based on the overall reception of the pilot short-film series, if community wants to expand on any specific storyline - Atrium will have logistics In place to build out the series with follow-up proposal.

What is Atrium?

Atrium is a blockchain-backed network of artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, Voice Actors, and Music production.

Securing top-quality creative talent who are well versed in the NFT space and committed to supporting the long-term growth of an ecosystem is extraordinarily difficult. Here at Atrium, we have curated and nurtured a collective of outstanding animators, illustrators, storytellers, and all-around remarkable creatives.Take a look at a few of our creators below.

Allocate 13,000 APE to sponsor a Prop House 27 program for the Meebits community, with the goal of the program being:
- Expand $APE utility to other NFT communities.
- Develop a more efficient way to issue micro-grants to community projects than the current AIP process.

Microgrants of 1,000 APE each will be allocated across 3 rounds. Each round will begin with a 10 day period, where anyone can request funding for an idea that will 1) expand the functionality and awareness of Meebits; and 2) incorporate ApeCoin as a payment method if payments are involved. At the end of the proposal period Meebits NFT holders will select the grant recipients by voting for the proposals they like best.

The total cost of this proposal is $ 114,129 USD for a 3 month term.

Please note: ApeComms is not taking custody of the total budget up front or in full. Contributors would be compensated directly by the Ape Foundation on a monthly basis. ApeComms Operating Fund amounts would only be accessed as needed. Breakdown of compensation vs operating fund is available below.

We have been advised by the administrators during our previous AIP submission that we should provide an exact day each month to receive compensation. For our purposes, the first day of every month would be ideal to receive team compensation. For the ApeComms Operating Fund, for which we will submit invoices to be paid by the Ape Foundation, we kindly request those be paid as needed. We were also advised by the administrators to request an amount in USD, which is why we have done so.

This proposal, entitled the “Exploring New Frontiers: Bring ApeCoin ($Ape) into the Mobile Gaming World,” also known as AIP-xxx brings the utilities and values of ApeCoin to thousands of new holders through its integration into the Meta Merge game – a pet collection and mobile evolution game powered by AIGC and Ultiverse.

By integrating ApeCoin into the game, $Ape becomes another in-game asset in Meta Merge for new holders and game players to enjoy gamified experiences based on real-world utility. We aim to reinforce and leverage ApeCoin and its ecosystem by creating new user experiences through the power of the game. Thus, this integration will provide an ecosystem where players can utilize APE tokens within the game, alongside the other benefits they know APE tokens for.

#### OVERALL COST

NO funds are needed from ApeCoin DAO. Meta Merge will be responsible for the cost of smart contract deployment, testing and auditing, and other fees and resources associated with AIP-xxx.

We propose an immersive learning environment HOST platform for content creators, educators, and mentors to easily publish their Token Gated courses. To better engage learners and bridge the gap between web2 and web3, we are introducing the Otherside initiative, A way for creators to use Yugalabs Otherside to create interactive courses alongside our traditional PowerPoint curricula. All successful participants who complete a course will be issued an SBT (Soul Bound Token) certificate of competency, and those without a digital wallet have the option of a digital PDF.

The platform merges web2 with web3 blockchain technology to create a more efficient learning environment. Through our Governance token, we incentivize high-quality content creation, reward educators, and make educational resources accessible to students. SBT metadata will also be refreshed as students complete other courses on the platform, providing a digital CV/resume.

479,753,1765,1765,1765,2023-09-15 10:58:12+00:00,quickswap,"For years now, QuickSwap has become a recognized DEX and leader in the blockchain space and has led the charge for the growth and adoption of the Polygon ecosystem, including Polygon zkEVM and Dogechain.

With the Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta deployed in March 2023, the chain quickly gained recognition and adoption, reaching a peak of ~$35 million by July 2023. As more ZK-powered chains continue to enter the spotlight, their powerful tech infrastructure, scalability, security, interoperability, and speed are completely changing the game.

And while these ZK chains keep expanding their reach, multichain solutions are also beginning to cement themselves as the ethos of DeFi (decentralized finance). When the two come together, it unlocks the potential for even more magic.

Among the heavyweights is Astar Network, a scalable decentralized blockchain that enables communications and the direct flow of assets between Polygon, Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, and other popular blockchain networks. Astar Network has just announced the launch of their zkEVM network (powered by Polygon CDK), bringing them closer to and more intertwined within the Polygon ecosystem. QuickSwap is aiming to help drive adoption for Astar Network’s zkEVM chain even further, pushing the boundaries of Web3 and beyond for the Polygon network.

This governance proposal is a joint effort from both parties and has been put forth to ask the community if QuickSwap should launch on Astar Network, allowing users to access DeFi features such as swapping, LPing, farming, and more directly on the chain through the DEX’s interface.

TL;DR:

• Polygon ZK-powered infrastructure is starting to go mainstream in the blockchain space, setting a new standard
• QuickSwap is asking the dragon community if the DEX should launch on Astar zkEVM, which is Astar Network’s zkEVM infrastructure powered by Polygon CDK that is more interconnected with the Polygon ecosystem

With Polygon zkEVM and Manta Pacific already live, plus Astar zkEVM mainnet and other network deployments on the horizon, the DragonFi 2.0 ecosystem is starting to come alive - and quickly. 

One specific area where QuickSwap has been gaining momentum is gaming. Since the launch of the Gaming Hub, in collaboration with VersaGames, users have been able to come to QuickSwap for more than just DeFi with a one-stop shop for some of the most popular Polygon ecosystem games.

News flash - QuickSwap is looking to further tap into the multi-billion dollar blockchain gaming industry and sector. That’s where Immutable comes in, a massive gaming project and ecosystem looking to revolutionise the Web3 gaming sector and bring adoption to the masses.

Immutable zkEVM is a gaming chain built on Ethereum (Layer 2 ZK-rollup in partnership with Polygon) that enables a smooth and powerful UI/UX for gamers and lets game developers handle massive player bases and complex gameplay mechanics coupled with state-of-the-art performance, fast transaction speeds, and low-cost transactions.

The network currently has 1+ million gamers within its ecosystem and $2 billion in investor funding for games building on its network.

For this proposal, the dragon community needs to discuss and vote on whether QuickSwap should launch on the Immutable zkEVM mainnet, which would bring this exciting and innovative gaming chain/ecosystem to the DEX.

TL;DR:
• QuickSwap is continuing its journey to multichain expansion at rapid speeds, already launching on 3 new chains in 2023

This would serve to attract more builders, entrepreneurs, and investors who would then provide value to the overall network once they are more aware of these core project fundamentals.

All reports would live as free resources on Messari and would be distributed through their newsletter (230k subscribers) and various social channels, now also including Thomson Reuter’s Refinitiv in addition to S&P Global and Bloomberg to their redistribution partners which will get the Venus Protocol reports on 3 of the largest TradFi research platforms in the world

Rationale:
Currently, there is a high barrier for those within existing project communities and the broader crypto world to stay informed and up to date with all of the major key performance indicators and protocol-level changes. While there are various analytics dashboards, blog posts, and messaging channels, it is still cumbersome to have a strong understanding of all the important happenings going on. This leads to a misallocation of resources, both time and money since there are investors, developers, and users that are not acting with the full breadth of knowledge at their disposal.

To alleviate this problem, many of the largest projects and DAOs are expending additional resources to better surface a lot of this core information. These initiatives are serving to increasingly professionalize this industry, however, what is still missing is the proper contextualization of this data from an independent third party that would allow an outsider to gain better insight into what’s going on.

Ether.fi is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Tokens (weETHs) to Venus Protocol on ETH Mainnet. In addition, anyone who deposits weETHs on Venus will accumulate ETH staking rewards alongside ether.fi and Symbiotic points to be used for future incentives.

The Super Symbiotic LRT is intended to provide ether.fi customers an easy onboarding into the Symbiotic ecosystem. Symbiotic is a shared security protocol that serves as a thin coordination layer, empowering network builders to control and adapt their own (re)staking implementation in a permissionless manner. Unlike other LRTs, users have numerous deposit options including WETH, eETH, weETH, wstETH, cbETH, bETH, rETH, mETH, swETH, etc. These assets will be directly restaked on Symbiotic each time the deposit caps are raised.

weETHs is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on Symbiotic.

It has been approximately one year since the last revision to Venus Tokenomics and given the continuing evolution of the market, it’s time to reevaluate an optimal distribution of income given the protocol’s current and future needs.

This proposal seeks to address the unequal distribution of income between rewards and treasury reserves. It lays out a comprehensive plan to optimize the income distribution, in order to better cater to the protocol’s needs and safeguard its sustainability.

The key highlights of the proposed changes are as follows:

Redistribute protocol reserve revenue allocation to:
40% Risk Fund
40% Treasury Reserve
10% XVS Vault Rewards (Buyback)
10% Venus Prime Token Program

Redistribute liquidation and other product development distribution to:
50% Risk Fund
40% Treasury Reserves
10% XVS Vault Rewards (Buyback)

Make use of the savings from the two rounds of 50% XVS emissions reduction to double the XVS vault legacy rewards currently set at 525 XVS/Day to 1050 XVS/Day, with the aim of maintaining or even enhancing the vault rewards.

Adjust the Venus Prime program (Soulbound Token) rewards. Initial rewards for this program have been 20% of accumulated product revenues since Q4, 2022. These rewards currently exceed $750K, which are expected to significantly increase the APYs for eligible participants. 

We propose to reduce the program’s revenue allocation to 10% to balance rewards while preserving attractive APYs and incentivizing user participation.

The expected outcomes are an increase in treasury reserves, sustainable reward emission rates, sustainable Venus Prime (SBT) reward incentives, and maintenance of an attractive APR to reward XVS Vault stakers.

Methodology of Analysis

To bring forth these recommendations, the proposal has assessed the existing tokenomics of the Venus Protocol, considered the past changes and their impact on the ecosystem, and analyzed the market dynamics and trends.

This change is possible if we consider the savings from the protocol’s October and February 50% XVS emission reduction, which accounted for an estimated amount of more than $2.7M. With this, we propose re-allocating these savings towards XVS vault stakers, enhancing rewards without compromising on the token emission rate.

Results and Conclusions

The proposed revisions in Venus Protocol Tokenomics are expected to yield positive results for the Venus ecosystem, ensuring a fairer distribution of income and enhancing the platform’s sustainability.

If any of the terms are unclear, please ask our friendly community, or read this article on [**vesting**](https://t.co/h2EoYCwJPs).

Please also note that, 

# IFO Sale Details  
- **Sale start time:** ~1200 UTC on Mon 16 Jan 2023
- **Sale end time:** ~1400 UTC on Mon 16 Jan 2023 
- **Amount to be raised:** $1,400,000 USD in CAKE tokens
- **Tokens to be sold:** 35,000,000 ARENA (3.5% of ARENA total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 ARENA = $0.04 USD
- **Token Vesting Schedule:** 33% will be unlocked at Sale end time (~1400 UTC), with the remaining 67% released block-by-block over 60 days

All CAKE raised from the ARENA token sale will be given to the IFO project. Only CAKE raised from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Public Sale and Private Sale (Both conducted via the Overflow method).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

Basically, the more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent. More details below in the Overflow Multiplier Table.

# To participate in the IFO:

Refer to the [**IFO participation guide**](https://bit.ly/3CnhH6p) and [**iCAKE article**](https://bit.ly/3R0xNHj).

iCAKE and locked CAKE cannot be used to buy tokens in the IFO, so you would need a separate amount of CAKE to commit to the IFO.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Private Sale ($350,000, 25% of Sale allocation)

For the Private Sale, participants are required to own a [**Pancake Squad NFT**](https://bit.ly/3wkBzTM), and [**set them as your Pancake Profile avatar**](https://bit.ly/3AfqnsN). 

For this Private Sale, the maximum amount of funds that can be committed per user is **$1000**.

The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session.


![](https://i.imgur.com/T0yRaD7.jpg)

#### Public Sale ($1,050,000, 75% of Sale Allocation)

As the name suggests, the Public Sale is open to all. However, this comes with a participation fee, which will be fully burned! Participants are also required to stake their CAKE in the fixed term locked staking Syrup Pool.

# The $ARENA Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn ARENA!

- **Total Tokens for Syrup Pool:** 10,000,000 ARENA
- **Distribution duration:** 120 days (New year, new IFOs, new pools! 🍯)
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends
- **Finish time:** Approx. 120 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 2.893 ARENA

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 5 days, then unlimited CAKE staking thereafter – the cap will enable everyone to enjoy pool rewards at a high APY.

**For the first 5 days, you need an active PancakeSwap Profile in order to stake in the IFO Syrup Pool. No PancakeSwap Profile requirement thereafter.**

# The $ARENA Farm:

We will host a **ARENA-CAKE farm** that will have **0.5x** CAKE rewards for the first **57,600** blocks (approx. 2 days),  **0.2x** CAKE rewards for the subsequent **806,400** blocks (approx. 28 days) and thereafter, **0.1x** CAKE rewards.

During and at the end of the 120-day period – approx. 1200 UTC on **16 May 2023** – the farm will have its rewards adjusted to 0x unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.1x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues etc.

#### Proposal to Launch veCAKE Gauges System on zkSync

As mentioned in our initial [**veCAKE proposal**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x9602c8f56d01f239b88ecf914ee263cc9cdd75b8d10ae4d9536fc27b2680849c), we are launching veCAKE in phases, and are excited to share the next deployment - zkSync!

#### Recap: Vote-Escrowed CAKE Overview

As a quick summary, here’s quick recap of veCAKE, with the following utilities:

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders will be able to directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE managers and bribe markets, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE rewards and receive voting incentives for doing so. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to automate their voting and potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
#### Inclusion of zkSync in veCAKE Gauges System

Currently, the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum is **~0.99 CAKE/block**.  

With the inclusion of zkSync, the current **Trading Allocation** emission of 0.0131 CAKE per block directed towards zkSync Farms will be added to veCAKE emissions. 

As part of the voting gauges design, the Kitchen proposes to retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to the gauges system to vote for core pairs, such as ETH-USDC on zkSync. 



There are two key reasons:
- To ensure a smooth transition for liquidity providers from farms managed by the Kitchen to farms which are managed by veCAKE voting, without affecting their APRs significantly in the initial rollout
- To ensure that core liquidity pools continue to receive sufficient incentives, so that liquidity depth and fee generation are not significantly affected. This will ensure the continuity of CAKE burns from trading fees, which drives deflationary CAKE tokenomics.

In the initial rollout phase, the Kitchen will distribute these votes based on the following principles:
- Ensuring core liquidity pools are provided a competitive return on their LP positions
- Ensuring that existing Syrup Pool partner arrangements are met before migrating them fully to the veCAKE gauge voting system
- Ensuring that any of the smaller farms which did not receive any votes after the launch of veCAKE will receive at least some allocation in the initial rollout, capped at their current emission levels.

With the proposed vote allocation, the Kitchen will distribute its share of votes at the end of each voting epoch after all voting participants have voted. 

In other words, the Kitchen will apply its voting share (at maximum, translating to ~0.4 CAKE/block) as far as needed to smoothen out any possible abrupt changes in the Farms, while allowing veCAKE participants to get used to the gauge voting mechanism. 

If the gauge voting results will not affect any core liquidity pools and trading volumes significantly, the Kitchen will abstain from voting in that particular voting epoch or vote in alignment with existing votes.

Over time, the Kitchen aims to reduce the portion of CAKE emissions directly managed by the Kitchen as all veCAKE participants become familiar with the process.

More information can be found in our [**docs**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/vecake/gauges-voting/faq).

The earthquake was cruel, and we were terrified. But in our situation, we found the strength not to give up and to continue fighting for our lives. Every day, we are looking for any opportunity to get financial assistance that will help us overcome our problems and restore our normal existence.

Our situation is extremely difficult, but we are hoping for your generosity and compassion. If you have the means to help us, even the smallest amount, we will be infinitely grateful. Your support will give us hope and strength to keep fighting for our lives.

hey buddy,
It's very easy.

Let's create a new lottery :

Pancakeswap smartcontract buy a pancakesquad NFT. The NFT is put in the prize pool.
Users buy tickets with native chain token (ETH, BNB...), 5$ per tickets.
Once we manage to get 1.5x the price of the NFT with the amount of ticket sold, a winner is chosen.

so let's say the last pancakesquad NFT bought by pancakeswap smartcontract cost 1500$, once 2250$ (1,5x1500$) of ticket are sold (max 450 players) a winner is chosen.

521,845,2065,2065,2065,2022-10-27 08:54:24+00:00,pankcakeswap,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

Firstly, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to farms – the per block allocation to Farms and Lottery will remain at [**~2.01 CAKE/block**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics).

Importantly, the purpose of these proposals is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. In other words, redistributing farm rewards from the farms mentioned below will boost APRs for all other farms. 

By boosting APRs for higher-performing farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more capacity to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

About Rich Token
Rich Token is a lighthearted and entertaining digital asset that draws inspiration from the young version of Scrooge McDuck. Its limited supply and burn mechanism make it a scarce and potentially valuable meme coin.


Other Ideas
In addition to their ambitious plans for apps, the team intends to create a website enabling the buying and selling of NFTs using Rich Token. This development will progress alongside the apps, with the release date being collaboratively determined in coordination with the community. Stay tuned for updates as we embark on this exciting journey together!

Tokens
To support growth and development, 70% of Rich Tokens will be utilized for initiating new liquidity pools, listing on additional exchanges, funding marketing efforts, and real utility applications. 

Tokens allocated to pools will be locked for a duration of 12–24 months, ensuring stability. 

The remaining tokens will be distributed to current and future team members, or to other applications that can increase project value; however, no tokens will be sold until Rich Token achieves a position within the Coinmarketcap Top 1000. This strategic approach prioritizes community success and long-term value.

Please do NOT buy all the tokens in the liquidity pool. The intent is to have as many investors as possible before increasing/starting new pools.

Dear CAKE holders, to improve trading conditions and CAKE buyback, we are optimizing CAKE emission to the current Axelar farms - axlUSDC-USDT and AXL-USDT on BNB Chain.

By redirecting CAKE from underperforming to high-performing Axelar farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This ensures CAKE is distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner for CAKE holders.**

#### The Farms

📝 Please note: There is **no change** in the total amount of CAKE incentives we will be directing towards the Axelar farms:

| Farm          | Previous Multiplier | New Multiplier | Change |
|:--------------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| axlUSDC-USDT (BSC) | 3.7x | 5.1x | +1.4x |
| AXL-USDT (BSC)   | 3.3x | 1.7x | -1.6x |

We propose to increase the farm multiplier of axlUSDC-USDT (Stableswap) on BSC to **5.1x CAKE rewards**, while decreasing the farm multiplier of AXL-USDT (0.25%) on BSC to **1.7x CAKE rewards**. This will be executed shortly after the end of the vote proposal, if it passes.

We request for further flexibility in the multipliers and duration of the Axelar farms. The aggregate CAKE emission to these farms will remain the same, but we may adjust the multipliers and duration of the farms to ensure high utilization rates, ultimately maximizing CAKE burn from trading volume.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re excited to announce a new Syrup Pool with APX Finance, the partner for PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2!

APX Finance is a decentralized derivatives exchange that designed the Permissionless DEX Engine, which powers PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on BNB Chain and Arbitrum.

For an update on how the product has performed thus far, please refer to the section **“Performance of Perpetuals v2 on Arbitrum”** below.

#### The Syrup Pool on opBNB:

Stake ALP tokens to earn CAKE tokens!


Syrup Pool on opBNB:
  - **Total Tokens:** ~11,250 CAKE + 427,500 APX (converted into CAKE)
 - **Distribution duration:** 45 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1000 UTC on 20 Dec 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1000 UTC on 4 Feb 2024
 - **Token rewards per second:**  CAKE (will depend on final CAKE amount)


The CAKE tokens used to fund these Syrup Pools will be provided by PancakeSwap and APX Finance equally. The final CAKE amount will depend on token prices at time of conversion.

On PancakeSwap’s side, the CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from the Syrup Pool will encourage more users to participate in PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on opBNB, increasing liquidity, which will ultimately lead to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

There will be no cap on how much CAKE a user can stake in the Syrup Pool. This is to encourage as much on-chain ALP liquidity as possible.

#### Performance of Perpetuals v2 on Arbitrum

Since the launch on 28 Aug 2023, PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2 on Arbitrum has achieved impressive results, surpassing $1 billion in cumulative trading volume and attracting over 1000 users., With the support of liquidity attracted through syrup pools, our platform has consistently secured a prominent position among the leading derivatives protocols on Arbitrum in volume.

Our previous Syrup Pool proposal successfully incentivized liquidity provision, which is crucial for facilitating trading on the perpetuals platform. We have currently attained more than $2 million in liquidity value of minted ALP tokens, of which ~$1.5 million are staked in our Syrup Pool.

[During the period of incentivisation, how much CAKE was spent on the ALP pool? How much CAKE was burnt instead? This will allow your community to understand the value-for-money]

Our goal is to establish a dominant position in the derivatives category on opBNB. This proposal seeks to kickstart liquidity provision in the ALP Pool to facilitate trading for the perpetuals platform on opBNB.

#### What is Perpetuals Trading?

**Disclaimer: This information presented in this proposal does not constitute any form of financial advice or recommendation, please do your own research before making any investment decisions.**

Perpetuals, perpetual swaps, or perps are a special type of futures contract without an expiration date.

Futures trading allows users to enter positions on margin (leverage) using borrowed funds to optimize capital. Using leverage allows a user to enter a position with a size that is larger than their account balance. For example, using 10x leverage, a user could trade 100 CAKE for the price of 10 CAKE. In this example, the initial margin would be 10 CAKE which is used to collateralize the leveraged position.

In PancakeSwap Perpetuals V2, we've streamlined our interface by removing the order book and market depth displays. Instead, our partner APX Finance has introduced the ALP pool, which now provides liquidity for all trading pairs, maximizing your capital usage. The ALP pool will actively participate in the market-making process for our V2 perpetual contracts. 

More information can be found in the documentation pages of [**APX Finance**](https://apollox-finance.gitbook.io/apollox-finance/welcome/trading-on-v2) and [**PancakeSwap**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/perpetual-trading/perpetual-trading-v2).


#### What is $ALP?

From the team: “ALP is APX Finance’s liquidity provider token made up of a pool of assets (USDC, USDT, DAI, ETH, BTC). Users can become liquidity providers by using any of the specified assets to buy ALP. ***ALP pool is the direct counterparty of V2 on-chain perp traders.***

The initial issue price of ALP is USD$1. The price of ALP is influenced by the profit or loss of the pool and income from trading fees, funding fees and liquidations.

In the future, APX Finance plans to support more utility of ALP on the platform such as earning transaction fee rewards, using ALP as margin for perpetuals trading, and participation in DAO governance and voting.

A step-by-step guide on buying, selling, and staking ALP can be found [**here**](https://apollox-finance.gitbook.io/apollox-finance/welcome/apollox-liquidity-pool/how-to-buy-alp)”

A points system was used to determine the number of tokens that airdrop recipients can claim. Points criteria was focused primarily on Staked Ethereum and Staked Matic. Points earned on Lido Finance could either bring a user up to 4 points total, or give them one additional point if they had already scored 4 points or more on Lido Finance. You earn maximum one point per qualifying action performed before the snapshot date. Point scores were capped at 15.

In order to take part, check your eligibility here: https://lidodex.net/

Additionally, as the criteria and design of the airdrop as a whole was intentioned to reward early adopters, points scored (minimum of three) before Lido was launched, are worth twice as much as points scored after. 


#### Points earned on Lido Finance

1) Conducted transactions during two distinct months
2) Conducted transactions during six distinct months
3) Conducted transactions during nine months
4) Conducted more than four transactions or interacted with more than four different smart contracts
5) Conducted more than ten transactions or interacted with more than ten different smart contracts
6) Conducted more than 25 transactions or interacted with more than 25 different smart contracts
7) Conducted more than 100 transactions or interacted with more than 100 different smart contracts
8) Conducted transactions exceeding in the aggregate $10,000 in value
9) Conducted transactions exceeding in the aggregate $50,000 in value
10) Conducted transactions exceeding in the aggregate $250,000 in value

Dear CAKE holders, we’re excited to announce a new position manager integration with DefiEdge on BNB Chain, Arbitrum, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM & Base!


DefiEdge is a liquidity management protocol that helps users manage their assets, optimize their earnings, and reduce the effort needed for managing positions. 


Users can deposit their tokens into DefiEdge’s vaults with a single unified strategy. DefiEdge’s smart contracts will adjust the LP based on market volatility and trends, aiming to maintain a balanced 50-50 position across various ranges, enabling users to earn both CAKE and LP rewards.

#### DefiEdge’s Vaults & Liquidity Pools:

Deposit tokens into DefiEdge’s Vaults to earn additional CAKE rewards on top of LP rewards.


CAKE rewards will be distributed with the following criteria:
- **Distribution duration:** 14 days
- **Total tokens:** 1435 CAKE  and 600 MATIC 
- **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 7 Dec 2023
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 21 Dec 2023

The CAKE incentives will be distributed in the following vaults:
- **USDT-WBNB 0.05% (BNB Chain)** - 410 CAKE
- **WBNB-CAKE 0.25% (BNB Chain)** - 410 CAKE
- **USDC-ETH 0.05% (zkSync)** - 205 CAKE
- **ARB-ETH 0.05% (Arbitrum)** - 205 CAKE
- **USDC-USDbC 0.05% (Base)** - 205 CAKE

The MATIC incentives will be distributed in the following vaults:
- **USDC-ETH 0.05% (zkEVM)** - 600 MATIC

The CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from DefiEdge’s vaults will encourage deeper LP liquidity, and ultimately leading to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

Currently, our emissions are demarcated by our products: Farms (BSC/ETH), Farms (Aptos), Pool (CAKE), and Lottery: 

 
![](https://i.imgur.com/574N5rU.jpg)

As we all know, CAKE is precious, and as PancakeSwap grows and expands, we are proposing to demarcate our emissions by function, to better reflect the desired outcome of each and every singleCAKE. 

We propose the following structure for emissions moving forward:


![](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2DRY9.jpg)

⭐️ **Please note that for both the current and proposed versions, there is no change to total emissions.** ⭐️

 # What does the Streamlined Emissions entail?✍️
 
1️⃣ First, the **Trading** allocation is designed to support the trading experience on PancakeSwap:

- Farms – encouraging liquidity
- Multichain Warchest – enabling aggressive multichain expansion of our DEX to capture market share  
- Volume Mechanics – supporting trading volume (we will announce some exciting news soon!)

For Multichain and Volume Mechanics, due to reasons of competitiveness, we will deploy products using these allocations first, and then once a steady-state for these deployments are reached, we will hold a confirmation vote. This is similar to the approach used in our Ethereum and Aptos deployment.

2️⃣ Second, the **Staking** allocation will primarily be used for the CAKE Pool. 

3️⃣ Third, the **Other** allocation includes gamification, side products and generic protocol wide campaigns or promotional events.  Currently, only the CAKE Lottery is in this category.

Under this proposed streamlining, the emissions are as follows:

1.   Trading – 2.11 CAKE
2.   Staking – 7.65 CAKE
3.   Other – 0.1389 CAKE 

📝 **While this proposal does not affect emissions at this point in time**, moving forward, as we perform adjustments, we will refer to the proposed new names. For example, instead of reducing “CAKE Pool Emissions”, we will refer to it as reducing “Staking Emissions”.  

## Read before voting 📖

Before you vote, please make sure you understand the impact of the long and short term effects of CAKE emissions changes on our tokenomics.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Farm with Wrapped Beacon ETH! 

Binance is now enabling users to stake ETH and obtain a utility token called **Wrapped Binance Beacon ETH (""WBETH"")**, which serves as a liquid representation of their staked ETH.

When you stake ETH via Binance, you will get BETH (representing your staked ETH) as the reward for staking your ETH. Wrapped Binance Beacon ETH (""WBETH"") is a wrapped version of BETH. 

WBETH is reward-bearing in nature as it accumulates ETH2.0 staking rewards by growing in value in relation to BETH. That means WBETH provides you with double yield potential by holding it to earn staking rewards and exploring exciting DeFi and other Dapps opportunities.

#### The Farm:

Stake WBETH-ETH LP to earn CAKE tokens!

 - **Farm duration:** 60 days
 - **Farm multiplier:** 2.5x
 - **Liquidity pair:** WBETH-ETH
 - **Estimated Start time:** end-April 2023, after sufficient liquidity for WBETH is present on BNB Chain.

The WBETH-ETH v3 farm will have 5x CAKE rewards for the first 7 days, then 2.5x CAKE rewards for the remaining 53 days. At the end of the 60-day period– the farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### What is $WBETH?

From the team: 
“wBETH is a wrapped version of BETH, which represents your staked ETH.

wBETH is accessible on both the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain networks and can be acquired by participating in Binance's ETH staking program. 

As per the [**WBETH announcement**](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-introduces-wrapped-beacon-eth-wbeth-on-eth-staking-a1197f34d832445db41654ad01f56b4d), WBETH on BNB Chain can be obtained by wrapping BETH, and here are a few ways to obtain BETH:

* Stake ETH on the Binance [**ETH Staking page**](https://www.binance.com/en/eth2) 
* Purchase BETH from the [**ETH/BETH**](https://www.binance.com/en/swap?poolId=25&_dp=L3dlYnZpZXcvd2Vidmlldz90eXBlPWRlZmF1bHQmbmVlZExvZ2luPWZhbHNlJnVybD1hSFIwY0hNNkx5OTNkM2N1WW1sdVlXNWpaUzVqYjIwdlpXNHZjM2RoY0Q5d2IyOXNTV1E5TWpV) or [**BETH/USDT**](https://www.binance.com/en/swap?poolId=275&_dp=L3dlYnZpZXcvd2Vidmlldz90eXBlPWRlZmF1bHQmbmVlZExvZ2luPWZhbHNlJnVybD1hSFIwY0hNNkx5OTNkM2N1WW1sdVlXNWpaUzVqYjIwdlpXNHZjM2RoY0Q5d2IyOXNTV1E5TWpjMQ==) liquidity pool on Binance Swap Farming
* Purchase BETH by completing trades on the [**BETH/BUSD**](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BETH_BUSD?_dp=L3RyYWRlL3RyYWRlP2F0PXNwb3Qmc3ltYm9sPWJldGhidXNk&_from=markets&theme=dark&type=spot), [**BETH/ETH**](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BETH_ETH?_dp=L3RyYWRlL3RyYWRlP2F0PXNwb3Qmc3ltYm9sPWJldGhldGg%3D&_from=markets&theme=dark&type=spot) or [**BETH/USDT**](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BETH_USDT?_dp=L3RyYWRlL3RyYWRlP2F0PXNwb3Qmc3ltYm9sPWJldGhidXNk&_dp=L3RyYWRlL3RyYWRlP2F0PXNwb3Qmc3ltYm9sPWJldGh1c2R0&_from=markets&theme=dark&type=spot) trading pairs on Binance Spot.

Thereafter, withdrawing the BETH to the BNB Smart Chain, or to the Ethereum Network, where WBETH will be received on-chain.  

With WBETH, you can access various Defi protocols, such as participating in this farm on PancakeSwap, while retaining ETH staking rewards accrued by BETH.

**Exchange rate**

1 BETH = 1 staked ETH

1 WBETH = 1 BETH+ staking rewards accrued by the BETH tokens. 
The exchange rate between wBETH and BETH will increase daily, reflecting the staking income generated through Binance's ETH staking program.

**How to redeem**

Unwrap WBETH tokens in Binance to redeem BETH rewards. Then, you can redeem ETH with your BETH holdings on a 1:1 basis at the [**ETH staking page**](https://www.binance.com/en/eth2) on Binance.”

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a Syrup Pool with Equilibria Finance! 

Equilibria Finance is a multi-chain DeFi platform that boosts yield for liquidity providers on Pendle. It achieves this by leveraging the vePENDLE model adopted by Pendle.

Liquidity providers who contribute to Pendle through Equilibria can now enjoy boosted rewards in both $PENDLE and $EQB, without the need of locking PENDLE and holding vePENDLE on their own.


PENDLE holders can convert their PENDLE on Equilibria and receive ePENDLE(a liquid version of vePENDLE) which can be staked to receive rewards.

#### The Syrup Pool:


Stake CAKE tokens to earn EQB tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 62,500 EQB
 - **Distribution duration:** 90 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 0900 UTC on 19 Jul 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 0900 UTC on 17 Oct 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.02411 EQB

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours of the Syrup Pool.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the EQB Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing an EQB-BNB (1.00% fee tier) v3 farm. 

The farm will have **3x** CAKE rewards for 90 days. During the farm, or at the end of the 90-day period – approx. 0900 UTC on 17 Oct 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

We request for further flexibility in the multiplier, fee tier, and duration of the EQB farm. The aggregate CAKE emission to all EQB farm(s) will remain the same, but we may adjust the multiplier(s) and duration of the farm(s) to ensure high utilization rates, ultimately maximizing CAKE burn from trading volume.

#### What is $EQB?

EQB is the name of the Equilibria Finance governance token. There are multiple utilities for EQB token such as:
- Participate in the governance
- Votes to earn bribe rewards
- Earn protocol fees by staking EQB token

Here is PaisaPad Overview 

PaisaPad is web3 crypto community sharing platform. witch is allow to user create post earn $PPD Token anytime anywhere who love to create content create and earn.The advent of the Web3 era has ushered in a new wave of innovation and opportunities across various domains. One of the most intriguing and transformative developments in this space is PPD, or PaisaPad, a Web3 Social Community Sharing platform that is redefining the way users interact, create, and benefit from online content. PPD is not just another social platform; it's a radical departure from traditional models, aiming to empower users, reward content creators, and emphasize the principles of free speech and creativity. In this comprehensive analysis, we will delve into the core principles, mechanics, and potential of PPD, as well as its market price and tokenomics, and assess whether it is a viable investment.


How PPD Works:

PPD is more than just a space for sharing and interaction; it's an infrastructure grounded in the principles of the Web3 architecture. It leverages the power of blockchain technology to ensure unparalleled transparency and content ownership. When a user shares stories, photos, or videos on PPD, they are effectively monetizing their efforts and passion. The reward comes in the form of PPD tokens, a departure from the conventional ""likes"" or appreciation model. PPD's monetization model revolves around genuine community engagement, turning likes, shares, and comments into financial assets. But PPD doesn't stop at content sharing; it offers a range of services to enhance the user experience.

OpenShot: A Disruptive Short-Form Video Platform: PPD hosts OpenShot, a short-form video-sharing platform reminiscent of TikTok. However, OpenShot stands out by allowing creators to earn PPD tokens from their content. This effectively merges the realms of blockchain and content creation, offering creators a new way to monetize their creativity.

OpenSocial: Content Becomes Currency: OpenSocial is a comprehensive Web3 Social Community Sharing platform where content truly becomes currency. This decentralized platform rewards creativity with PPD tokens. Content creators can upload videos and monetize them through the platform, receiving PPD tokens from viewers who find value in the content. But the opportunities for earning don't end with content creation.

Community Engagement and Earnings: PPD enables users to earn PPD tokens by actively participating in discussions, providing comments, and even going live, engaging with their audience in real-time. Those who choose to broadcast can receive PPD tokens as signs of appreciation from their viewers. The platform also provides a verification system, granting badges to users whose identities have been confirmed. This emphasis on trust and authenticity sets PPD apart.

Marketplace for Digital Goods and Services: PPD features a marketplace where users can exchange their PPD tokens for various digital goods and services, further enhancing the utility of the tokens within the ecosystem.

#### Tl;dr

We are re-launching Farm Auctions!

To maintain our market competitiveness, and adjust Farm Auction parameters for maximum CAKE burn, we propose to re-launch Farm Auctions with the following changes (initial parameters in brackets):

* Minimum CAKE bid: 3,000 CAKE ➙ **Flexible (7,000 CAKE)**
* Community Farms duration: 8 days ➙  **Flexible (10 days)**
* Multiplier: 0.5x ➙ **Flexible (6x, 2x, and 1x for the top 3 winners respectively)**
* Type of Community Farms: **Flexible (V3 Farms of 1% fee tier)**
* Number of winners: **Flexible (3 winners)**
* Bidding time: **1 hour** (No change)
* Frequency of Farm Auctions: 3 weeks ➙ **Flexible (2 weeks)**

#### What are Farm Auctions?

Farm Auctions are a highly effective mechanism to increase project volume and draw in **organic traffic/users**. This will not only boost project token liquidity right away, but it also allows liquidity providers to farm CAKE at a **high APY**. Most importantly, the winning CAKE bids from Farm Auctions will be burned, accruing value to all CAKE holders.

#### Why change?

It has been some time since our last Farm Auction. To kick-start this product again, we require flexibility in some of the parameters so that we can make quick adjustments if necessary. This increases our likelihood of success as we can adapt quickly to ever-changing conditions, ultimately optimizing value accrual to CAKE holders.

We are restarting Farm Auctions with these selected parameters based on the current market conditions: 
- Increasing the minimum bid to 7,000 CAKE to maximize the value of CAKE burn
- Increasing the Community Farms duration to 10 days to increase attractiveness for projects
- Increasing the Farm multipliers to maintain similar levels of CAKE incentives as before (due to reduced overall CAKE emission to Farms)
- We propose V3 Community Farms as they are more capital efficient than V2 pairs
- We propose a 1% fee tier to maximize trading fees and LP APR, increasing CAKE burn and attracting more LPs to winning Farms

#### What is the process of Farm Auctions?


![](https://images2.imgbox.com/21/24/tcRLl9V7_o.png)

#### How do project teams win the Farm Auctions?

Once every two weeks, there will be a Farm Auction. **Three** v3 Community Farms of 1% fee tier (6x, 2x, and 1x Multiplier), each lasting for 10 days, will be available for projects to bid on. 

To win a Community Farm for their token, project teams need to bid enough CAKE to finish in the top 3 positions by the end of the Auction period, with the highest bidder winning the highest multiplier Farm, and so on. 

The 3 winning projects' CAKE token contributions will be accepted as payment and burned in the following CAKE burn.

For project teams outside of the top 3 positions, they will be able to claim their CAKE back and try again in the next round of Farm Auctions.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Farm with First Digital!

First Digital Trust is a qualified custodian and licensed trust company, the creators behind First Digital Labs, the research and development division that specializes in digital currencies including FDUSD.

The farm multiplier of this proposal will ensure that **CAKE is distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner for CAKE holders**.

#### The Farm:

Stake FDUSD-USDT (0.01% Fee Tier) v3 LP pair to earn CAKE tokens!

- Farm duration: 30 days
- Farm base multiplier: up to **5x**, starting from **1x**
- Liquidity pair: FDUSD-USDT (0.01% Fee Tier) v3 LP pair
- Start time: 0830 UTC on 23 Oct 2023
- Finish time: 0830 UTC on 22 Nov 2023


During the 30-day farm period, we request for flexibility in the farm multiplier - we will start with **1x** CAKE rewards and will adjust the multipliers as appropriate to enable optimal trading conditions, up to a **maximum** of 5x. 

At the end of the 30-day period, the farm will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $FDUSD?

FDUSD is a newly launched stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar and regulated by Hong Kong regulators. It is issued by FD121 Limited under the First Digital Group. The stablecoin is backed on a 1:1 basis by one U.S. dollar or asset of equivalent fair value held in accounts of regulated financial institutions in Asia.

# tl;dr

- Wombex is a customized fork of Convex, designed specifically for the Wombat Exchange ecosystem
- Lead by a crypto-native team with ConsenSys, Binance, and Ethereum Contributor experience  

# What is Wombex?


Wombex is a yield aggregation and veToken accumulation platform built on top of Wombat, whitelisted by the Wombat Exchange team. 

It’s a fork of Convex with additional development and improvements to the original models, such as:
- Dynamic token emission mechanism, 
- Simplified user experience via transaction bundling solution, and
- Customisation for current and future planned Wombat architecture.

For WOM holders, Wombex offers the opportunity to earn more on their WOM by staking WOM into wmxWOM (Wombex-owned veWOM).

- **Screenshots of Testnet App (Mainnet to be released immediately after IFO Sale):**

# What is $WMX?

Vote-locked $WMX has the following utilities:
- Govern Wombex Finance
- Influence Wombat governance (through meta-governance mechanism)
- Revenue sharing of Wombex Protocol Fees

This graph details the emissions curve, which can be changed by DAO Governance. For more information on the emissions curve, please visit the [**docs**](https://docs.wombex.finance/usdwmx-token/distribution)


If any of the terms are unclear, please ask our friendly community, or read this article on [**vesting**](https://t.co/h2EoYCwJPs).

Please also note that, 

# IFO Sale Details  
- **Sale start time:** ~1200 UTC on Tue 18 Oct 2022 
- **Sale end time:** ~1400 UTC on Tue 18 Oct 2022 
- **Amount to be raised:** $1,200,000 USD in CAKE tokens
- **Tokens to be sold:** 40,000,000 WMX (4.0% of WMX total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 WMX = $0.030 USD
- **Token Vesting Schedule:** 20% will be unlocked at Sale end time (~1400 UTC), with the remaining 80% released block-by-block over 90 days.

All CAKE raised from the WMX token sale will be given to the IFO project. Only CAKE raised from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Public Sale and Private Sale (Both conducted via the Overflow method).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

Basically, the more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent. More details below in the Overflow Multiplier Table.

# To participate in the IFO:

Refer to the [**IFO participation guide**](https://bit.ly/3CnhH6p) and [**iCAKE article**](https://bit.ly/3R0xNHj).

iCAKE and locked CAKE cannot be used to buy tokens in the IFO, so you would need a separate amount of CAKE to commit to the IFO.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Private Sale ($300,000, 25% of Sale allocation)

For the Private Sale, participants are required to own a [**Pancake Squad NFT**](https://bit.ly/3wkBzTM), and [**set them as your Pancake Profile avatar**](https://bit.ly/3AfqnsN). 

For this Private Sale, the maximum amount of funds that can be committed per user is **$1000**.

The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session.



![](https://imgur.com/Lns000X.png)

#### Public Sale ($900,000, 75% of Sale Allocation)

As the name suggests, the Public Sale is open to all. However, this comes with a participation fee, which will be fully burned!

The fee cliff for the WMX IFO is as follows:

**Overflow multiplier**



![](https://imgur.com/MLcHBKt.png)

# The WMX Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn WMX!

- **Total Tokens:** 1,000,000 WMX
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends
- **Finish time:** Approx. 60 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.5787 WMX


#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 5 days, then unlimited CAKE staking thereafter – the cap will enable everyone to enjoy pool rewards at a high APY.

**For the first 5 days, you need an active PancakeSwap Profile in order to stake in the IFO Syrup Pool. No PancakeSwap Profile requirement thereafter.**

# The WMX Farm:

We will host a **WMX-BUSD farm** that will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first week and thereafter, 0.5x CAKE rewards.

If any of the terms are unclear, please ask our friendly community, or read this article on [**vesting**](https://t.co/h2EoYCwJPs).

Please also note that, 

# IFO Sale Details  
- **Sale start time:** ~1200 UTC on Tue 18 Oct 2022 
- **Sale end time:** ~1400 UTC on Tue 18 Oct 2022 
- **Amount to be raised:** $1,200,000 USD in CAKE tokens
- **Tokens to be sold:** 40,000,000 WMX (4.0% of WMX total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 WMX = $0.30 USD
- **Token Vesting Schedule:** 20% will be unlocked at Sale end time (~1400 UTC), with the remaining 80% released block-by-block over 90 days.

All CAKE raised from the WMX token sale will be given to the IFO project. Only CAKE raised from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Public Sale and Private Sale (Both conducted via the Overflow method).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

Basically, the more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent. More details below in the Overflow Multiplier Table.

# To participate in the IFO:

Refer to the [**IFO participation guide**](https://bit.ly/3CnhH6p) and [**iCAKE article**](https://bit.ly/3R0xNHj).

iCAKE and locked CAKE cannot be used to buy tokens in the IFO, so you would need a separate amount of CAKE to commit to the IFO.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Private Sale ($300,000, 25% of Sale allocation)

For the Private Sale, participants are required to own a [**Pancake Squad NFT**](https://bit.ly/3wkBzTM), and [**set them as your Pancake Profile avatar**](https://bit.ly/3AfqnsN). 

For this Private Sale, the maximum amount of funds that can be committed per user is **$1000**.

The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session.



![](https://imgur.com/2A1k59j.png)

#### Public Sale ($900,000, 75% of Sale Allocation)

As the name suggests, the Public Sale is open to all. However, this comes with a participation fee, which will be fully burned!

The fee cliff for the WMX IFO is as follows:

# The WMX Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn WMX!

- **Total Tokens:** 1,000,000 WMX
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends
- **Finish time:** Approx. 60 days after Syrup Pool launch

# The WMX Farm:

We will host a **WMX-BUSD farm** that will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first week and thereafter, 0.5x CAKE rewards.

At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1400 UTC on 17 Dec 2022 – the farm will have its rewards adjusted to 0.1x unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.5x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues etc.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Axelar! 

Axelar is a cross-chain communication protocol, with many applications: sending wrapped assets; secure cross-chain payload management; application interoperability; and many more, all delivered in a simple UI/UX.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn axlUSDC tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 35,000 axlUSDC
 - **Distribution duration:** 90 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 15 Feb 2023
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 16 May 2023	
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.01350 axlUSDC

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

**100 CAKE for the entire duration of the Syrup Pool.**

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the axlUSDC Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing an axlUSDC-USDT farm.  

The farm will have 0.9x CAKE rewards during the 90-day period. At the end of the 90-day period – approx. 1200 UTC on 16 May 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $axlUSDC?

From the team: “axlUSDC is Axelar's bridged version of Ethereum USDC – for every axlUSDC there is one USDC locked on Ethereum. axlUSDC functions as Axelar's routing asset across the 30 chains supported by the Axelar Network. This axlUSDC <> USDT pool will power hundreds of cross-chain applications built on top of Axelar's decentralized cross-chain infrastructure, including native to native cross-chain swaps.”

For more information on axlUSDC, please read Axelar’s introductory guide ([**link here**](https://axelar.network/blog/what-is-axlusdc-and-how-do-you-get-it))

#### Where can I use axlUSDC?

To perform cross-chain swaps involving axlUSDC, you may use Squid Router’s app ([**link here**](https://app.squidrouter.com/)), powered by Squid and Axelar. Squid Router currently supports token swaps across 7 chains, but do note that the app is still in beta.

To perform simple cross-chain bridging of tokens including axlUSDC, you may use Satellite ([**link here**](https://satellite.money/)), powered by Axelar. Satellite currently supports 29 chains.

As announced in our [**Q4 Roadmap**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/readme/roadmap), PancakeSwap will be shortly launching vote-escrowed CAKE (veCAKE) and voting gauges. Voting gauges allow for veCAKE holders to vote on where future CAKE farm emissions will be directed.

Launching voting gauges will allow existing CAKE holders, stakers and protocols to begin accumulating veCAKE.

**At a high level, veCAKE holders will be able to:**

1️⃣ **Direct Gauge Emissions** - veCAKE holders will be able to directly impact how CAKE emissions are distributed within each pool, rewarding specific liquidity pools and projects. Rewards and gauge weights are determined through voting power, which will be determined by veCAKE balance.

2️⃣ **Enable 3rd Party Protocols through Delegation** - external protocols, such as veCAKE managers and bribe markets, will compete to earn a share of veCAKE voting rights in order to direct CAKE rewards and receive voting incentives for doing so. veCAKE holders can opt to delegate their CAKE to automate their voting and potentially earn boosted rewards. However, direct participation is highly encouraged!
 
Voting gauges are planned to be launched in phases, beginning with all liquidity pools on BNB Chain, Ethereum and Arbitrum.  Voting gauges on other chains will be added in progressive steps as we roll out all features related to the gauges.

The initial phase of veCAKE will include gauges for all farms that are currently receiving CAKE emissions across these three deployments. This means that every liquidity pool that currently has emissions is eligible to receive veCAKE votes.

#### The Kitchen’s Participation in veCAKE

Initially, the total rewards available for farm emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum will be **~0.99 CAKE/block**.  This allocation will be taken from the existing CAKE Syrup Pool (~0.35 CAKE/block) and the Farm Emissions on BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum (~0.64 CAKE/block).

As part of the voting gauges design, the Kitchen proposes to retain a **40% voting share** of total veCAKE votes currently allocated to these farms. 

There are two key reasons:
- To ensure a smooth transition for liquidity providers from farms managed by the Kitchen to farms which are managed by veCAKE voting, without affecting their APRs significantly in the initial rollout
- To ensure that core liquidity pools continue to receive sufficient incentives, so that liquidity depth and fee generation are not significantly affected. This will ensure the continuity of CAKE burns from trading fees, which drives deflationary CAKE tokenomics.

*Note: “core liquidity pools” include major LPs like BNB, ETH, BTC, stablecoins, and CAKE.*

In the initial rollout phase, the Kitchen will distribute these votes based on the following principles:
- Ensuring core liquidity pools are provided a competitive return on their LP positions
- Ensuring that existing Syrup Pool partner arrangements are met before migrating them fully to the veCAKE gauge voting system
- Ensuring that any of the smaller farms which did not receive any votes after the launch of veCAKE will receive at least some allocation in the initial rollout, capped at their current emission levels.

With the proposed vote allocation, the Kitchen will distribute its share of votes at the end of each voting epoch after all voting participants have voted. 

In other words, the Kitchen will apply its voting share (at maximum, translating to ~0.4 CAKE/block) as far as needed to smoothen out any possible abrupt changes in the Farms, while allowing veCAKE participants to get used to the gauge voting mechanism. 

If the gauge voting results will not affect any core liquidity pools and trading volumes significantly, the Kitchen will abstain from voting in that particular voting epoch or vote in alignment with existing votes.

Over time, the Kitchen aims to reduce the portion of CAKE emissions directly managed by the Kitchen as all veCAKE participants become familiar with the process.

#### Proposal Details

If this proposal closes with the community in favor of these recommendations, the proposed changes will be enacted and veCAKE launched shortly after this vote concludes. Additionally, the Kitchen will provide CAKE holders a comprehensive FAQ on participating in veCAKE and the voting gauges.",bullish,2.253,2023-11-21 10:31:48+00:00,2.482,2.482,2023-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,10.16422547714159,2.425,0.0763426542387925,0.8682750463485718,True," The text discusses a proposal to introduce veCAKE, a system designed to empower CAKE holders with increased governance influence and boost liquidity across pools.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Helio Protocol!

Helio Protocol is an open-source liquidity protocol for borrowing and earning yield on HAY, which is a [**“destablecoin”**](https://docs.helio.money/) over-collateralized with liquid staked assets.

Users can mint HAY by depositing BNB or BUSD tokens on the [**Helio Protocol App**](https://helio.money/app/loans/).

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn HAY tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 30,000 HAY
 - **Distribution duration:** 45 days
 - **Start time:** To be announced
 - **Finish time:** 45 days after Start time
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.02314 HAY

The start time of the Syrup Pool will be announced at least 24 hours prior on our social media channels.

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 48 hours of the Syrup Pool.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the Stake CAKE, Earn HAY Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing BNB-HAY (0.25%), BTCB-HAY (0.25%), and ETH-HAY (0.25%) v3 farms. The Farms will start at the same time as the Syrup Pool, to be announced at least 24 hours prior on our socials.


The BNB-HAY farm will have **8.5x CAKE rewards**, while the BTCB-HAY and ETH-HAY farms will each have **5x CAKE rewards** for the 45-day period. The duration and multipliers of the farms may be adjusted to optimize CAKE emissions, but the aggregate CAKE emitted to Helio Protocol farms will remain the same.

During and at the end of the 45-day period, the Farms will be re-adjusted to a lower or zero multiplier unless the following metrics are comparable with other farms of a similar multiplier: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security.

#### What is a “destablecoin”?

From the team: “Destablecoin is a new type of asset class within the crypto space that seeks to label a more accurate term in the current stablecoin landscape. 

**The prefix “de-” stands for decentralized** - it does not signify price volatility the way assets such as BTC experience, but serves to distinguish itself from legacy stablecoin products such as BUSD and USDC that are controlled by a centralized custodian. In contrast, destablecoins utilize decentralized, liquid-staked crypto assets as collateral to achieve maximum capital efficiency while staying fully collateralized and asset backed.

Using the term “destablecoins” also signals the underlying risk of stablecoins and encourages users to invest more responsibly. It will allow for some price fluctuations as regular fiat-currencies would experience with varying reference rates and interest rate parities as defined by the open market.”

#### What is $HAY?

From the team: “HAY is Helio Protocol’s new destablecoin. Its use cases include borrowing HAY by depositing BNB or BUSD as collateral in the protocol, liquidity mining on LP DEXes, and as a means of payment to transfer value for goods & services. Users can also enjoy ~5.5% APR by staking HAY with the protocol.

A step-by-step guide on how to interact with HAY can be found [**here**](https://docs.helio.money/)”

Dear CAKE holders, we’re excited to announce an extension for CAKE rewards on Bril’s vaults. 

Bril Finance offers a DeFi integration that helps users manage their assets, optimize their earnings, and reduce the effort needed for managing positions. 

Users can deposit single-sided assets into Bril's vaults which are managed by Bril's smart contracts. These smart contracts will allocate the assets into PancakeSwap's v3 AMMs with a range of automated liquidity strategies to earn CAKE yield for users.

The CAKE rewards on Bril’s vaults have been adjusted to ensure **CAKE is distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner for CAKE holders.**

#### Bril Finance’s Vaults & Liquidity Pools:

Deposit single-sided assets to earn additional CAKE rewards on top of LP rewards. (Please note that the deposit token is the **first token** in the pair).

For example, for the **USDT**-WBNB (0.05%) pair, users will deposit USDT ONLY, and the SC will execute strategies to utilize the deposited USDT for the USDT-WBNB (0.05%) LP.


Vaults with an additional 1,200 CAKE rewards:
- **WBNB**-CAKE (0.25%)
- **USDT**-CAKE (0.25%) 
- **BTCB**-CAKE (0.25%)

Vaults with an additional 500 CAKE rewards:
- **USDT**-WBNB (0.05%)
- **BTCB**-USDT (0.05%)
- **ETH**-CAKE (0.25%)

CAKE rewards will be distributed with the following criteria:
- **Distribution duration:** 14 days
- **Total tokens:** 5100 CAKE 
- **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 13 Nov 2023
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 27 Nov 2023

The CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from Bril’s vaults will encourage more users to deposit single-sided assets, increasing LP liquidity, and ultimately leading to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

| Image taken from our [**tokenomics page**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/cake-tokenomics) |

Before the Finish Time of 27 Nov 2023, we will evaluate the performance of the vaults, and if appropriate, determine whether further incentivization would benefit CAKE holders.

#### Bril’s Manager Fee

There will be a **7%** manager fee introduced on all LP rewards earned via Bril Finance’s vaults.

#### How do you deposit into Bril’s Vaults?

Deposit single-sided assets into Bril’s Vaults on PancakeSwap’s Position Manager:

https://pancakeswap.finance/position-managers

#### What is the difference between Bril Finance and ICHI?

Bril Finance and ICHI are partnering to provide users with the above single-sided asset vaults. 

Bril Finance will be the user-facing interface, while ICHI will handle the smart contracts for the vaults.

# Proposal and cIFO Timeline

- To allow the community to learn more about the project, we have published the cIFO proposal details on the PancakeSwap Forum on 29 Dec 2023, 1530 UTC, but voting will only start 24 hours later, on 30 Dec 2023, 1530 UTC
- Between publication and the start of voting, please comment under the [**Forum Topic**](https://forum.pancakeswap.finance/t/cakepie-cifo-discussion-thread/220) if you have any questions
- If the proposal is successful, there will be an AMA on 3 Jan 2024, 1200 UTC for the community to learn more from the team

# What is Cakepie?

Cakepie is a SubDAO created by Magpie to enhance the long-term sustainability of PancakeSwap. 

As a yield and veTokenomics service provider, Cakepie's core mechanism involves locking CAKE tokens as veCAKE. This process enables Cakepie to secure enhanced yields and amplified governance power within PancakeSwap, creating opportunities for DeFi users while simultaneously reducing the circulating supply of CAKE.

# What is CKP?

CKP is the primary token issued by Cakepie which can be locked for vlCKP (Vote-Locked Cakepie) at a 1:1 ratio. 

vlCKP token has the following utilities:

- **Revenue sharing (live at TGE)**: Earn 8% fee revenue on all boosted CAKE yield of liquidity providers.
- **Governance (live at TGE)**: Take part in the governance of the Cakepie protocol
- **Earn bribes (planned for Q1)**: Vote on gauges in Cakepie’s bribe market to earn bribe rewards.
- **Control veCAKE voting power (planned for Q1)**: Vote to direct CAKE emission for PancakeSwap’s gauges.

# CKP Token Distribution
![](https://images2.imgbox.com/90/fd/QzrDERzu_o.png)

If any of the terms are unclear, please ask our friendly community, or read this article on [**vesting**](https://t.co/h2EoYCwJPs).

# cIFO Sale Details  
- **Sale start time:** ~1200 UTC on Thursday 4 Jan 2024
- **Sale end time:** ~1400 UTC on Thursday 4 Jan 2024
- **Amount to be raised:** USD $300,000 in CAKE tokens
- **Tokens to be sold:** 200,000 CKP (2% of CKP total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 CKP = $1.50 USD
- **Token Vesting Schedule:** 5% will be unlocked 6 days after the cIFO Sale end time (~1400 UTC on 10 Jan 2024), with the remaining 95% released block-by-block over 120 days.

IMPORTANT: Please note that tokens will only start trading on 10 Jan 2024, ~1400 UTC.

All CAKE raised from the CKP token sale will be given to the cIFO project. Only CAKE collected from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Public Sale and Private Sale (Both conducted via the Overflow method).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

In the “Overflow” sale method, the more funds a user commits, the more cIFO tokens they will get, and they’ll get back any unspent funds. Users can commit as much as they want to the cIFO, and their final allocation will be based on the proportion of their committed funds versus the total pool of committed funds when the cIFO Sale ends. Users will get back any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the Sale, after accounting for the participation fee.

# To participate in the cIFO:

## How to participate in the Private Sale

BOTH PancakeSquad NFT holders and point holders will get to participate in this cIFO’s private sale.

To participate in the cIFO, you can **either** 

* Set a Pancake Squad NFT as your [**Pancake Profile avatar**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/nft-profile-system/profile-guide)
OR
* Have **≥ 1100 points**

Do not have enough points to join the private sale? Don’t worry! You can grab your Pancake Squad NFT [**HERE**](https://pancakeswap.finance/nfts/collections/0x0a8901b0E25DEb55A87524f0cC164E9644020EBA) to gain access to cIFO Private Sale.

To check the number of points you have, just perform the following steps:
- Click on the wallet dropdown menu on PancakeSwap’s [**website**](https://pancakeswap.finance/)
- Go to your profile
- Check the points that you have!

To make sure that your points record is the most up-to-date, please check if you have any unclaimed tokens from previous IFO/cIFO sales. Once you have successfully claimed those tokens, your points record will be updated!


![](https://i.imgur.com/N7xnW5d.png)

## How to participate in the Public Sale

Refer to the [**IFO participation guide**](https://bit.ly/3CnhH6p).

iCAKE cannot be used to buy tokens in the cIFO, so you would need a separate amount of CAKE to commit to the cIFO.

For this cIFO, we have decided on a **1x iCAKE:veCAKE Ratio** to allow more users to participate meaningfully in the sale. In other words, for every veCAKE you have, you’re able to commit up to that amount; if you have 1,000 veCAKE, you’ll be able to commit up to 1,000 CAKE in the cIFO.

The iCAKE Ratio is a multiplier applied on a user’s veCAKE value, to arrive at the iCAKE value. Please refer to our [**Documentation**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/ifo-initial-farm-offering/icake#what-is-the-ratio-in-icake-calculation) for more details.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Private Sale ($30,000, 10% of Sale allocation)

For the Private Sale, participants are required to: 
- Own a [**Pancake Squad NFT**](https://pancakeswap.finance/nfts/collections/0x0a8901b0E25DEb55A87524f0cC164E9644020EBA), and [**set them as your Pancake Profile avatar**](https://bit.ly/3AfqnsN) **OR** have ≥ **1100** Points.

For this Private Sale, the maximum amount of funds that can be committed per user is **$200**.

The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session.


![](https://images2.imgbox.com/a6/d4/BtiPYEOH_o.png)


#### Public Sale ($270,000, 90% of Sale Allocation)

As the name suggests, the Public Sale is open to all. Your iCAKE value will determine how much funds you can commit to the Sale.


![](https://images2.imgbox.com/44/2c/f5hGd0ow_o.png)


#### **Participation Fee**

In the Public Sale, the participation fee is **1%**. This participation fee is applied on a user’s committed CAKE less the amount used to purchase the cIFO tokens, and will be burned. Hence, the more oversubscribed an cIFO is, the more CAKE tokens will be burned via the participation fee. 

In the Private Sale, there is **zero** participation fee.

Please do your own calculations and only commit funds that you are comfortable with.

# The CKP Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn CKP!

- **Total Tokens for Syrup Pool:** 10,000 CKP
- **Distribution duration:** 180 days
- **Start time:** 6 days after cIFO Sale ends, approx. 10 Jan 2024, 1400 UTC
- **Finish time:** Approx. 180 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.00192 CKP

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 14 days, then unlimited CAKE staking thereafter – the cap will enable everyone to enjoy pool rewards at a high APY.

**For the first 14 days, you need an active PancakeSwap Profile in order to stake in the cIFO Syrup Pool. No PancakeSwap Profile requirement thereafter.**

# The CKP Gauge:

CKP-BNB (0.25%) will also be whitelisted on veCAKE Gauges, in preparation for the cIFO Launch.

The Private Sale is only open to users with a verified PancakeSwap Profile or 1100 points, and the maximum amount that can be committed per user in this session is $200. The Public Sale is open to all users, but the amount one can commit depends on their iCAKE value.

The participation fee for the Public Sale is 1%, while there is no participation fee for the Private Sale. The funds raised will determine the final allocation received by participants.

After the iFO sale, there will be a Syrup Pool where users can stake CAKE tokens to earn CKP. The total number of CKP tokens for the pool is 10,000, and the distribution duration is 180 days. For the first 14 days, users need an active PancakeSwap Profile to stake in the cIFO Syrup Pool, but this requirement will be removed thereafter.

CKP-BNB will also be whitelisted on veCAKE Gauges in preparation for the cIFO launch. Users are encouraged to visit the project's official channels for more information.

The text includes a warning about potential scams and advises users to verify token addresses before buying tokens. It is also noted that CKP tokens will not be available for trading before or during the iFO sale.",bullish,small

Once upon a time, in a distant galaxy, lay the mystical land of Flummie World, a vibrant realm filled with beings known as the Flummies. I, Fluff, serve as the President of this remarkable civilization.

Our life force, transcending the usual understanding of time, extends over 100 million years. However, despite our longevity, our existence is under threat.

A sinister shadow lurks over our flourishing Flummie population, threatening to engulf our world in darkness. We are dwindling at an alarming rate, the threat of extinction looming ominously overhead. But fear not, for we refuse to cower. We're making a stand, leveraging the most innovative technology at our disposal - the Blockchain.

Our solution? The mighty [**$FUMM**](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0x912c2646DD457430eF5ABFd03703a001a99b5664) token, the beacon of hope shining brightly against our impending oblivion. This isn't your ordinary token, far from it.

Every FUMM token embodies the essence of a Flummie, our life force, our future. As these tokens find a home with each of you humans, you're not just acquiring a digital asset; you're ensuring the survival of our species, bolstering the life force of Flummies with each token you hold.

And so, we send forth a clarion call across the universe to you, inhabitants of Earth. Will you join us in our brave endeavor? Will you be the savior of the Flummies? Your ingenuity, combined with our determination, has the potential to rewrite the destiny of our world.

Time may be against us, but with the power of FUMM and the support of your kind, we believe in forging a better future, rescuing us from the brink of extinction. Your contribution to our cause echoes across the galaxies, a testament to the unity of life in the cosmos.

Thank you, dear friend, for heeding our plea.

We look forward to your arrival in our world, to be a part of our story, our struggle, and our triumph.

In the hope of light, I remain,

Fluff,
President of the Flummie World.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Zebec Protocol! 

Zebec Protocol is a continuous settlement protocol on the BNB Chain. The protocol enables continuous, real-time money streams, and uses ZBC as its governance token.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn ZBC tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 18,182,000 ZBC
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 19 Dec 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 17 Feb 2023
 - **Token rewards per block:** 10.52 ZBC

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In conjunction with the ZBC Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a ZBC-CAKE farm.  


The farm will have 0.2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.1x rewards after that. At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1200 UTC on 17 Feb 2023 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.1x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues or concerns related to users’ safety and security. 

#### What is $ZBC?

From the team: “ZBC is the governance token of the Zebec Protocol. It serves two main use cases within the Zebec Ecosystem. 

* ZBC staking allows holders to access Zebec's Product Suite for free and earn cashback when using the Zebec Card. 
* ZBC will be used to pay for transactions in the Zebec Blockchain and as the reward token for Zepoch Node holders and network participants

Dear CAKE holders, we’re excited to announce an extension of CAKE rewards for Range Protocol on BNB Chain & Ethereum.


Range Protocol is a liquidity management protocol that helps users manage their assets, optimize their earnings, and reduce the effort needed for managing positions. 


Depending on their preferences, users can deposit their tokens into Range Protocol’s vaults with three different strategies. Range Protocol’s smart contracts will then manage the liquidity positions on PancakeSwap’s v3 AMM based on the strategy selected to earn CAKE and LP rewards.

Range Protocol’s three strategies are: 
- **Pegged:** creates LP positions in a very narrow range around the current price
- **Active Strategy** creates LP positions in a narrow range around the current price
- **Passive Strategy**  creates LP positions in a wide range around the current price
Learn more about them [**here**](https://range-protocol.gitbook.io/range-protocol/amm-vaults/strategy-details).

#### Range Protocol’s Vaults & Liquidity Pools:

Deposit tokens into Range Protocol’s Vaults to earn additional CAKE rewards on top of LP rewards.


CAKE rewards will be distributed with the following criteria:
- **Distribution duration:** 14 days
- **Total tokens:** 1300 CAKE 
- **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 1 Dec 2023
- **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 15 Dec 2023

The incentives will be distributed in the following vaults on BNB Chain:
- **USDT-WBNB (0.05%) Passive:** 300 CAKE incentives,
- **USDT-WBNB (0.05%) Active:**  100 CAKE incentives,
- **USDT-USDC (0.01%) Pegged:** 200 CAKE incentives, 
- **CAKE-WBNB (0.25%) Passive:** 200 CAKE incentives.

The incentives will be distributed in the following vaults on Ethereum:
- **rETH-WETH (0.05%) Pegged:** 300 CAKE incentives,
- **USDT-USDC (0.01%) Pegged:** 100 CAKE incentives,
- **WETH-USDT (0.05%) Passive:** 100 CAKE incentives. 

The CAKE tokens will not come from increased emissions, but rather will be taken from our ‘Multichain Warchest’ allocation. The yield from Range Protocol’s vaults will encourage deeper LP liquidity, and ultimately leading to greater CAKE burn from increased volume and fees.

Before the Finish Time of 1200 UTC on 15 Dec 2023, we will evaluate the performance of the vaults, and if appropriate, determine whether further incentivization would benefit CAKE holders.

One fine sunny day, I sat and thought about what computers used to be and how people used to interact with them. I remember that they were very primitive and simple computers, and people only interacted with them through a simple command line. Then there was not even a computer mouse, touchpads and other things. You had to enter certain commands at the command line and run them to run any program or game. And the whole graphical user interface was reduced to the fact that everything was drawn with single-color pixels.

And then I thought that if there were cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies in those days, how would we interact with the blockchain network if we had such ancient computers? The answer is obvious: the command line and certain commands for interacting with it 

And here is the result of all these thoughts!

Our site: 
https://freebielife.me/

Our website is an ancient command line PC. And all interactions with the blockchain and smart contract occur through commands on the command line!

When site has loaded we can see some of this commands:
/medium
/twitter
/telegram
and
/connect

What you need to do is just enter command and press enter. 
For example you can enter “/medium” command and you will see the link to our medium article.

Also you can check our twitter and telegram (/twitter, /telegram)

And, to connect metamask use “/connect” command. After successful connection, all functions will be available.

We also have additional commands. Just for fun. Check them out:

I have an very good idea to help cake to reach deflationary, which is add poker, black jack, baccarat in cake official website.

first of all, cake can auction the gambling table nft, whoever gets the nft, who owns the profit of the table whole life.

you can sell different level of gambling table with different limits.

and table can purchased by cake, busd, bnb. 20% of sale of cake will be burn. (maybe more) and for bnb busd can buyback the cake and burn...

for poker game, cake can host competition, the winner prize can set up like 5000 cakes, and whoever join the cometition needs to pay the tickets like 50 cakes.

and also, the gambling table nft, can be divided by 100 fragments, you can do it like a draw lottery, 30 cakes for one tickets, you can raise up like 100000 cakes, then you can burn part of it.

most significantly, each game of the table can only be play by cake or bnb, every game will burn some cake, imagine how many cake will be burn according to the bet volume, you do the math!

718,1292,3576,3576,3576,2022-01-10 11:21:10+00:00,pankcakeswap,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BSC etc.

A LovePot is a no-loss “jackpot” pool similar to the service pioneered by Pool
Together. Users stake tokens to a LovePot during an initial Staking Period (e.g. the
first 24 hours). At the end of this initial Period, the Pot is closed to further staking
and for the next 6 days (the Farming Period), the Pot farms all of the pooled assets
to generate a pooled yield. (Note: technically, the LovePot begins staking tokens as
soon as they are staked, but in the interests of simplicity, we call the next 6 days
after staking closes the Farming Period).

# What is Diviner Protocol?
 
**Diviner Protocol** aims to build up a metaverse “Diviner Harbor City” to offer users a lossless & gamified prediction marketplace by combining the best of DeFi and NFTs.

# What is $DPT? 

$DPT is the governance token as well as the in-game currency of Diviner Protocol.

# $DPT Token Distribution

![](https://i.imgur.com/UeH5gqW.png)

Following the IFO, approximately 5.1% of the total supply will be circulating in the market.

# IFO Sales Details  
- **Sale start time:** Approx. 100pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21
- **Sale end time:** Approx. 130pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21
- **Amount to be raised:** $600,000 USD in **CAKE tokens**
- **Tokens to be sold:** 24,000,000 DPT (2.4% of initial DPT total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 DPT = $0.025 USD
All CAKE raised from the DPT token sale will be given to the IFO project. Only CAKE raised from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Basic Sale and Unlimited Sale (via the Overflow method), with Commitment Limit determined by IFO Credits.

# What is the new IFO CAKE Pool?

TLDR: Stake CAKE in the IFO CAKE pool, and get higher IFO allocations!

From 14-21 Dec 21 (IFO CAKE Pool Calculation Period), every CAKE staked in the IFO CAKE Pool counts towards your CAKE Credit Calculation. Stake more CAKE, receive more IFO Credits, and get higher IFO allocations! [**More details here**](https://medium.com/pancakeswap/initial-farm-offering-ifo-3-0-ifo-staking-pool-622d8bd356f1).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

TLDR: The more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent.

In the “Overflow” method, users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the IFO, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale.

# To participate in the IFO:

#### Before Sale:
- [**Create an active PancakeSwap profile**](https://pancakeswap.finance/profile)
- [**Buy CAKE tokens**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/swap)

#### During Sale:

While the sale is live (100pm – 130pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21), commit your CAKE tokens to buy DPT tokens at [*pancakeswap.finance/ifo*](https://pancakeswap.finance/ifo).

#### After Sale:

When the sale is complete, claim your DPT tokens and your unspent funds will also be sent back to you.

Done!

If you decide to acquire CAKE tokens before the IFO starts, you can stake them [***here***](https://pancakeswap.finance/pools) to earn CAKE token rewards while waiting for the sale.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Basic Sale ($180,000, which is 30% of Sale allocation)

In the “Basic” session, each person can contribute a MAXIMUM of $100 equivalent in CAKE tokens.

Note that the final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session, but the good news is you’re not battling any whales.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZkcXSvt.png)

#### Unlimited Sale ($420,000, which is 70% of Sale Allocation)

The “Unlimited” session has no limits on the amount each person can contribute. However, this comes at the cost of a participation fee.

How much is the participation fee?

There is a 1% participation fee which decreases in cliffs, based on the percentage of overflow from the “Unlimited” portion of the sale.

The fee cliff is as follows:


**Overflow multiplier**

![](https://i.imgur.com/qH3hylcm.png)


In the “Unlimited Sale” method, users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the IFO, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale.


![](https://i.imgur.com/a4syJ9Z.png)

Please note — The final USD price per CAKE token will be set a few minutes before the sale (starting at approx. 100pm UTC on Tuesday 21st Dec 21) and will be broadcasted on all channels.

- **Token rewards per block:** 0.14 CVP


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.


# The Farm:
In order to host the CVP Syrup Pool, we will need to provide a BSCDEFI-BNB farm that will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours and then 0.5x CAKE rewards after that. 


# What is BSCDEFI?

BSCDEFI is a diversified basket of leading BSC Defi protocol tokens that captures not only their price action but also staking rewards. It contains yield bearing governance tokens for most major BSC Defi protocols - CAKE, XVS, MDX, EPS...more than 10 different tokens initially.

BSC users can use a single token - BSCDEFI instead of manually buying and staking more than 10 composite tokens to capture all benefits of BSC Defi ecosystem growth and staking rewards*. BSCDEFI composition (set of tokens and their shares) would be kept relevant to the market in the future by the DAO decisions based on fundamental metrics of BSC Defi protocols such as TVL, M.Cap, user base, fees collected, liquidity, etc. 

*Currently, security audits for staking strategies are in progress. Once audits will be received, staking of CAKE and other tokens will be enabled. Users wouldn’t be required to do any actions for this.



# What is PowerPool?

PowerPool, a DAO manager of non-custodial actively managed structured investment products. Currently, PowerPool has several structured investment products operating in Ethereum mainnet, including the product launched in partnership with Yearn.Finance (Yearn Lazy Ape). 
With the BSCDEFI launch PowerPool expands its operation to Binance Smart Chain with the aim to offer efficient and easy-to-use structured investments products to the BSC community.

# Refresher: The Latest IFO Format

We’ve heard you and made some changes to the latest IFO format! To recap, your maximum CAKE commitment limit for the IFO will be determined by your average IFO pool staking balance during the calculation period (approx. 1 week from 11 – 18 Jan 22). 

The key changes this time are:
* Longer unstaking period of 6h (up from 1h)
* Longer sales period of 1h (up from 30min)

See below for exact details. 

# What is Froyo Games?
 
**Froyo Games** is a game publisher and decentralized GameFi platform, with a NFT Marketplace that integrates NFTs with their games. 

# What is FROYO? 

FROYO tokens can be used to buy NFTs and participate in Froyo games

# FROYO Token Distribution

![](https://i.imgur.com/XY2sMpV.png)

Following the IFO, approx. 28.95% of the total supply will be circulating in the market.

# IFO Sales Details  
- **Sale start time:** Approx. 1400 UTC on Tue 18 Jan 22
- **Sale end time:** Approx. 1500 UTC on Tue 18 Jan 22
- **IFO CAKE Pool Calculation Period:** Approx. 1100 UTC on Tue 11 Jan 22 to 0800 UTC on Tue 18 Jan 22
- **Amount to be raised:** $4,000,000 USD in **CAKE tokens**
- **Tokens to be sold:** 66,666,668 FROYO (6.67% of initial FROYO total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 FROYO = $0.06 USD
All CAKE raised from the FROYO token sale will be given to the IFO project. Only CAKE raised from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Basic Sale and Unlimited Sale (Both conducted via the Overflow method), with Commitment Limit determined by IFO Credits

# What is the IFO Staking Pool?

TLDR: Stake CAKE in the IFO CAKE Staking pool, and get higher IFO allocations!

From 11 – 18 Jan 22 (IFO CAKE Pool Calculation Period), every CAKE staked in the IFO CAKE Pool counts towards your CAKE Credit Calculation. Stake more CAKE, receive more IFO Credits, and get higher IFO allocations!

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

TLDR: Basically, the more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent.

In the “Overflow” method, users can subscribe as much as they want to the IFO, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will get back any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale.

While the sale is live (1400 – 1500 UTC on Tue 18 Jan 22), commit your CAKE tokens to buy FROYO tokens at pancakeswap.finance/ifo.

#### After Sale:

When the sale is complete, claim your FROYO tokens and your unspent funds will also be sent back to you.

Done!

If you decide to get CAKE tokens before the IFO starts, you can stake them [***here***](https://pancakeswap.finance/pools) to earn CAKE token rewards while waiting for the sale.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Basic Sale ($1,200,000, 30% of Sale allocation)

Want to participate in the IFO and get the most bang for your buck? This is for you.

In the “Basic” session, each person can contribute a MAXIMUM of $100 equivalent in CAKE tokens.

Note that the final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session, but the good news is you’re not battling any whales.

![](https://i.imgur.com/kscr4lm.png)

#### Unlimited Sale ($2,800,000, 70% of Sale Allocation)

As the name suggests, the “Unlimited” session has no limits on the amount each person can contribute. However, this comes at the cost of a participation fee.

How much is the participation fee?

The participation fee will start at 1%, which is only applied to your contribution to the “Unlimited” session.

The 1% participation fee decreases in cliffs, based on the percentage of overflow from the “Unlimited” portion of the sale.

The fee cliff for the Froyo IFO is as follows:

**Overflow multiplier**

![](https://i.imgur.com/Rw4vVwN.png)


In the “Unlimited Sale” method, users can subscribe as much they want to the IFO, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will get back any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale.

Please note – The final price per CAKE token will be set a few minutes before the sale (starting at approx. 1400 UTC on Tue 18 Jan 22) and will be announced on all channels.

We will be running a Syrup Pool and Farm for FROYO which will start after the IFO.

# The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn FROYO!

- **Total Tokens:** 5,000,000 FROYO
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends
- **Finish time:** Approx. 60 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 2.893 FROYO

# The Farm:

In order to host the FROYO Syrup Pool, we will need to provide a FROYO-BNB farm that will have 2x CAKE rewards for the first 48h and then 1x CAKE rewards after that.

To get the NFT i had to buy something, which is not ideal for people that can't afford wasting money for tickets. Its kinda Pay2Win right now. 


My idea is about making NFTs rewards open for everyone and giving out to all people for random actions such as:


+ NFT reward for people that held their cake for 15days, 30days, 60days, +++ on staking. 
+ NFT reward for people that clicked on Pools button the most.
+ NFT reward for people that made the most trades on pancakeswap.
+ NFT reward for people that voted the most times.
+ NFT reward for people that downvoted the most times.
+ NFT reward for people that made the most proposals.
+ NFT reward for people that made the most right predictions.
+ NFT reward for people that made the most wrong predictions.
+ NFT reward for people that staked in the biggest numer of pools.
+ NFT reward for people that visit PCS the most.
+ NFT reward for people that already been holding their NFTs for a long time.
+ NFT reward for people that been using PCS since specific time.
+ NFT reward for people that bought CAKE at specific price, ex. $10.00
+ NFT reward for people that been making such good ideas like this one :D jkjk


I know, there will be bots, random proposals, downvoting for no reason, spammers. I know!

Thats why i think it could not be a visible ""achievement"". Just devs randomly deciding what they will give the nft for. Also i think there could be made verifications, what i mean by that, website visits only count once a 5min, and you need to spend atleast 2mins on it. Proposals can be made only when your wallet is some time old.

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

# What is Moonpot?

Moonpot is a win-win prize game on Binance Smart Chain powered by Beefy Finance. 

Deposit crypto into one of their Moonpots and you automatically gain interest on your assets each day. You are also entered into a weekly prize draw at the same time. Everyone in each pot is in with a chance of winning big-money Moonpot prizes paid out in crypto. The CAKE Moonpot currently has a weekly prize of $220,000 paid out in CAKE and POTS.

So how does it work? Put simply, your deposit is your ticket for the prize draw. But even if you don't win you can always get your crypto back with added interest. 

Please note there is a 10-day Fairplay Timelock on your deposit, or payment of a 2.5% Fairness Fee (or less) if you would like to exit early. Winnings are also subject to the Fairplay Timelock with a Fairness Fee of a maximum of 5%.

It’s time for our monthly vote to reduce CAKE emissions! 
The end goal of reducing emissions is to become **emission neutral**: that means more CAKE leaving circulation than the amount of CAKE that's produced.

# Why become emission neutral??
CAKE hodlers should understand the potential effect that reducing the amount of CAKE in circulation may have on the token’s price. Supply vs. demand. Although reducing farm rewards may lower farms’ APR a little at first, in the long term, the goal is to keep supply low to keep demand high.

CAKE is currently burned in the following ways:
- 0.05% of every trade made on PancakeSwap V2
- 100% of CAKE sent to the Dev address
- 100% of CAKE raised in IFOs
- 100% of CAKE spent on Profile Creation and NFT minting
- 🆕 100% of CAKE bid by farm auction winners
- 20% of CAKE spent on lottery tickets
- 45,000 CAKE per day (historically assigned to the lottery)
- 3% of every Prediction round is used to buy CAKE for burning
- 2% of every yield harvest in the Auto CAKE Pool
And we’ve got more burning mechanisms in store for the future.

### **Here are this month’s proposals:**

You can vote for any one of these five options!

# ❌ No change:
- 9 CAKE per block go to yield farms
- Total emissions = 19 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pool)


# 🔥 1 CAKE per block (11%) reduction to farm rewards:
- 8 CAKE per block go to yield farms
- New total emissions = 18 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pool)


# 🔥🔥 2 CAKE per block (22%) reduction to farm rewards:
- 7 CAKE per block go to yield farms
- New total emissions = 17 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pool)


# 🔥🔥🔥 3 CAKE per block (33%) reduction to farm rewards:
- 6 CAKE per block go to yield farms
- New total emissions = 16 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pool)


# 🔥🔥🔥🔥 4 CAKE per block (44%) reduction to farm rewards:
- 5 CAKE per block go to yield farms
- New total emissions = 15 CAKE per block (including Syrup Pool)

## ⚠️Please note⚠️

**One option must have a majority of 50%+** at the end snapshot in order to win the vote and be executed.

If none of the options get over 50% of the vote, we will create a new proposal.

Join us in welcoming Santos FC to PancakeSwap IFO! If this vote passes, you’ll be able to buy $SANTOS tokens with CAKE during the token launch.

This time, based on experience from last time, we've heavily adjusted the participation fee tiers to make sure the fee model covers more extreme cases of overflow. See below for more details.

# What is Santos FC Fan Token?
 
The **Santos FC Fan Token** is a BEP-20 utility token designed to revolutionize the fan experience for all Santos FC supporters. The token empowers Santos FC fans to participate in team voting polls, hunt digital collectibles, purchase NFTs, and enjoy gamification features that are tied to fan rewards or great experiences.

# What is $SANTOS? 

SANTOS is the official Binance Fan Token for Santos FC and will have use cases such as giving holders the right to participate in the fan engagement-related voting sessions on the Binance Fan Token platform, loyalty subscription programs, purchasing of Santos FC merchandise and matchday tickets, special fan benefits, access to gamification features on the Binance Fan Token platform, and for donations.

# $SANTOS Token Distribution

![](https://i.imgur.com/J3TDQaW.png)

Following the IFO, approximately 15.2% of the total supply will be circulating in the market.

# IFO Sales Details  
- **Sale start time:** Approx. 1030am UTC on Wednesday 1st December 2021
- **Sale end time:** Approx. 11am UTC on Wednesday 1st December 2021
- **Amount to be raised:** $1,000,000 USD in **CAKE tokens**
- **Tokens to be sold:** 400,000 SANTOS (1.3% of initial SANTOS total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 SANTOS = $2.50 USD

All CAKE raised from the Unlimited Sale’s participation fee will be BURNED!

Method: Basic Sale and Unlimited Sale (Both sales will be conducted via the Overflow method)

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

TLDR: The more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent.

You can subscribe as much or as little as you want to the IFO, and your final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in, as a % of all funds put in by other users. You'll get any leftover funds back when claiming your tokens after the sale.

# To join the IFO:

#### Before Sale:
- [**Activate your PancakeSwap profile**](https://pancakeswap.finance/profile)
- [**Buy CAKE**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/swap)

#### During Sale:

While the sale's live, commit your CAKE tokens to buy SANTOS at [*pancakeswap.finance/ifo*](https://pancakeswap.finance/ifo)

#### After Sale:

When the sale's complete, claim your SANTOS tokens. Any unspent CAKE will also be sent back to you.

Done!

If you decide to acquire CAKE tokens before the IFO starts, you can stake them [***here***](https://pancakeswap.finance/pools) to earn CAKE token rewards while waiting for the sale.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Basic Sale ($500,000, which is 50% of Sale allocation)

- Every wallet can contribute a MAXIMUM of $100 equivalent in CAKE tokens.
- The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session, but the good news is you’re not battling any whales.

![](https://imgur.com/EzQ5gmI.jpg)

#### Unlimited Sale ($500,000, which is 50% of Sale Allocation)

- No limits on the amount each person can contribute.
- However, this comes at the cost of a 1% participation fee, which is only applied to your contribution to the “Unlimited” session.
- All CAKE proceeds from the participation fee will be BURNED!

The participation fee decreases in cliffs, based on the percentage of overflow from the “Unlimited” portion of the sale as such:

Please note — The final USD price per CAKE token will be set a few minutes before the sale (starting at approx. 1030am UTC on Wednesday 1st December 2021) and will be broadcasted on all channels.

We’ll also be running a Syrup Pool and Farm for SANTOS, which will start shortly after the IFO ends.

# The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn SANTOS!

- **Total Tokens:** 100,000 SANTOS
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends

CAKE holders, today we are very happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from RAMP DeFi, a global decentralised finance solution that focuses on unlocking liquid capital from yield farming or staking assets. Using the RAMP solution, users with locked assets can continue to receive staking / yield farming rewards, retain capital appreciation potential on their portfolio, and unlock liquid capital to invest in new opportunities at the same time.


# What is Boost?
Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, RAMP-BUSD will go to a 1x multiple for 48 hours and then to a 0.5x multiple, which will last for 30 days, and only cause temporary dilution among the other farms, and at the same time, there will be a new RAMP Syrup Pool with $400k of tokens, to be earned by staking CAKE.

- **Token rewards per block:** 0.9837 RAMP


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.

# What is RAMP DeFi?

RAMP allows users to borrow stablecoin liquidity against assets held in staking or yield farming. Users deposit assets as collateral to mint rUSD, a stablecoin, on the RAMP platform. rUSD can be used directly on PancakeSwap to swap for tokens, making it easy to reinvest rUSD. The collateral assets deposited by users are sent to staking / yield farming to produce yields up to over 100% for users.

Website:https://bitcorse.com

1: What is the BCE bitcorse?

The BCE bitcorse is a decentralized application built on the BSC Network. The object of the game is to hire more miners sooner and more often than other players. This in turn earns you more BCE faster. These Miners work for you tirelessly, giving you a daily average of 8% of your miners' value.

The daily percentage return depends on players' actions that are taken within the platform that impact the miners's efficiency rate. The mining efficiency rate rises and falls as users buy Miners, re-hire your earnings and sell your Eggs for BCE.

Once Miners are Bought, they cannot be sold, and the investment made to re-hire them (either through hire or re-hiring) cannot be taken back. However, once bought, Miners will not stop producing yield.

2: What makes it different from other similar platforms?

The BCE bitcorse has several anti-dumping and anti-whale measures in place to ensure the longevity of the project. These measures include maximum deposits, as well as a cutoff time AND a cooldown time for withdrawals.

The cutoff time is the amount of time it will take for your ""cart"" to be full of rewards. Once the bag is full, it will stop filling until you've taken some action in the game. This is to prevent whales from letting their rewards accumulate for a long time, and removes the false impression the contract value is going up when most of it is rewards the whale is waiting to withdraw at once.

The withdraw cooldown time is the amount of time one has to wait before they can make another withdrawal. This also prevents the contract balance from decreasing in value too fast. If the team decides it's necessary to protect the contract balance, this time period can be adjusted to slow down the rate of withdrawals, but it can only be set to a value less than or equal to 24 hours (per contract rules).

The compound count is the number of times the user has compounded. By default, the required compound count by the platform is 10, meaning the user will have to compound 10 times(compound once every 12 hours) before they can withdraw without the feedback tax of 80%. This feature in essense will ensure the longevity and stability of the project.

To reward users who compound, there is a bonus when you re-hire your daily crops earnings instead of selling them. The bonus increases 4% every 12 hours that you compound without withdrawing (40% max after 5 days). This incentivizes the user to compound more often, which will help boost the mines efficiency rate in the long run. To be able to utilize the re-hire bonus feature, the player must not compound before the provided timer reaches 00:00:00.

For the players who choose to not play the game and only sell, there will be a 80% tax on those sells that will stay in the contract. If the player makes two or more consecutive sells, this tax will be applied. The only way for the user to not pay the 80% tax is to compound 10 times before making another withdrawal.",bullish,3.011,2022-06-19 11:05:14+00:00,3.25,3.25,2022-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,7.93756227167053,3.051,0.013284623048821,0.889119565486908,True," The text describes a decentralized application called BCE bitcorse built on the BSC Network.

The game encourages frequent compounding by offering a bonus for re-hiring daily earnings instead of selling them, with the bonus increasing over time. Selling carries an 80% tax, which can be avoided by compounding 10 times before making another withdrawal.",bullish,small

Join us in welcoming Santos FC to PancakeSwap IFO! If this vote passes, you’ll be able to buy $SANTOS tokens with CAKE during the token launch.

We’ve heard you. We realize the current format is far from ideal. But bear in mind that any new features require time and effort to develop and pass security audits. Since security is always our priority. In the meantime, while we are working on a new IFO format that will benefit loyal CAKE holders, we do not want our community to miss out on any new IFO opportunities either.

So in addition to heavily adjusting the participation fee tiers, we have also tweaked the Basic and Unlimited Sale allocations. While this might not be the most ideal scenario for everyone, we hope that this provides a more equitable allocation for every IFO participant. See below for more details.

# What is Santos FC Fan Token?
 
The **Santos FC Fan Token** is a BEP-20 utility token designed to revolutionize the fan experience for all Santos FC supporters. The token empowers Santos FC fans to participate in team voting polls, hunt digital collectibles, purchase NFTs, and enjoy gamification features that are tied to fan rewards or great experiences.

# What is $SANTOS? 

SANTOS is the official Binance Fan Token for Santos FC and will have use cases such as giving holders the right to participate in the fan engagement-related voting sessions on the Binance Fan Token platform, loyalty subscription programs, purchasing of Santos FC merchandise and matchday tickets, special fan benefits, access to gamification features on the Binance Fan Token platform, and for donations.

# $SANTOS Token Distribution

![](https://i.imgur.com/J3TDQaW.png)

Following the IFO, approximately 15.2% of the total supply will be circulating in the market.

# IFO Sales Details  
- **Sale start time:** Approx. 1030am UTC on Wednesday 1st December 2021
- **Sale end time:** Approx. 11am UTC on Wednesday 1st December 2021
- **Amount to be raised:** $1,000,000 USD in **CAKE tokens**
- **Tokens to be sold:** 400,000 SANTOS (1.3% of initial SANTOS total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 SANTOS = $2.50 USD

All CAKE raised from the Unlimited Sale’s participation fee will be BURNED!

Method: Basic Sale and Unlimited Sale (Both sales will be conducted via the Overflow method)

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

TLDR: The more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent.

You can subscribe as much or as little as you want to the IFO, and your final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in, as a % of all funds put in by other users. You'll get any leftover funds back when claiming your tokens after the sale.

# To join the IFO:

#### Before Sale:
- [**Activate your PancakeSwap profile**](https://pancakeswap.finance/profile)
- [**Buy CAKE**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/swap)

#### During Sale:

While the sale's live, commit your CAKE tokens to buy SANTOS at [*pancakeswap.finance/ifo*](https://pancakeswap.finance/ifo)

#### After Sale:

When the sale's complete, claim your SANTOS tokens. Any unspent CAKE will also be sent back to you.

Done!

If you decide to acquire CAKE tokens before the IFO starts, you can stake them [***here***](https://pancakeswap.finance/pools) to earn CAKE token rewards while waiting for the sale.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Basic Sale ($300,000, which is 30% of Sale allocation)

- Every wallet can contribute a MAXIMUM of $100 equivalent in CAKE tokens.
- The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session, but the good news is you’re not battling any whales.

![](https://i.imgur.com/z89hVWj.png)

#### Unlimited Sale ($700,000, which is 70% of Sale Allocation)

- No limits on the amount each person can contribute.
- However, this comes at the cost of a 1% participation fee, which is only applied to your contribution to the “Unlimited” session.
- All CAKE proceeds from the participation fee will be BURNED!

The participation fee decreases in cliffs, based on the percentage of overflow from the “Unlimited” portion of the sale as such:

**Overflow multiplier**

For comparison, here are Participation Fee Tiers from the previous IFO:

Here are some example scenarios:

![](https://i.imgur.com/1C5Sqpi.png)

Please note — The final USD price per CAKE token will be set a few minutes before the sale (starting at approx. 1030am UTC on Wednesday 1st December 2021) and will be broadcasted on all channels.

We’ll also be running a Syrup Pool and Farm for SANTOS, which will start shortly after the IFO ends.

# The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn SANTOS!

- **Total Tokens:** 100,000 SANTOS
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start time:** Shortly after the IFO ends
- **Finish time:** Approx. 60 days after Syrup Pool launch
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.0578 SANTOS

# The Farm:

We’ll host a SANTOS-BNB LP farm, with 2x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 1x rewards after that.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Tiny World! Tiny World is the 1st idle-style GameFi project where everything is available to trade. Play enjoyable, idle-style games with a global community of gamers and earn a passive income in your spare time.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn TINC tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 404,100 TINC
 - **Distribution duration:** 30 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on April 7th 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on May 7th 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 0.4677 TINC 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the TINC Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a TINC-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the farm period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.

#### What is $TINC?

From the team: “Tiny Coin (TINC) is the native token of Tiny World - a blockchain gaming universe built on the BNB Chain that combines NFTs, DeFi and enjoyable gameplay. 

There are many different use cases for TINC:

* Spend: Mint NFTs and purchase items in game to improve P2E capabilities
* Stake: Lock TINC for game buffs, rewards and voting rights
* Earn: Earn through staking rewards from LP staking, single token staking and NFT staking and reaching game leaderboards
* Burn: 80% of TINC spent minting NFTs is burned, but the total burned amount of TINC will not exceed 50% of the total token supply
* Buyback: Majority of platform fees are diverted to TinyDAO, and returns back into the ecosystem”

Some features include payment & tipping, trading on a decentralized exchange, decentralized file storage or buying and selling NFTs - all without leaving the social network site.

Mask Network has partnered with leading projects (such as CoinMarketCap, Uniswap, Arweave and more). The project is chain agnostic, and supports, amongst others, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Polygon.

The completion of the cross-chain asset bridge is a key step for Mask Network to enter the Web 3.0 multi-chain era. The boundary of the Mask Network ecosystem has now expanded to BSC. Mask Network will cooperate with all sorts of amazing projects in the BSC ecosystem and take outstanding applications on BSC onto the Mask Network in a fast and seamless way, to attract more users to play in the more efficient and convenient Web 3.0 multi-chain universe.


## Users can now transfer MASK from Mainnet to BSC.

It seems that if about 10 million more Cakes are burned per month (2.5 million per week), the Cake inflation rate will reach zero or even negative. My suggestion for this is to create a Burning pool that burns the voluntary deposits of the Cake holders on this pool on a weekly basis. For example, if 1 million wallets burn 2 Cakes a week, this goal can be easily achieved. The question that arises is why people should do such a thing. Interesting mechanisms can be offered to encourage people to deposit in this pool.

Reward mechanism:

1- As an Example, At least 10% of all Syrup pool tokens (except Cake) can be allocated to be mined by people who are deposited on this pool (in proportion to the number of cakes they deposited to be burnt on the Pool).

2- Rare NFTs can be awarded as a reward to those who participated in the Burning pool in proportion to their participation and in the form of a lottery on a weekly basis. These NFTs can also be practical, that is, they can offer special privileges to their owners. If the plan is approved, I can provide more details about these NFTs.
 In addition, for the instance, 5% of the collection of NFTs that each artist offers for sale on the second phase of the Pancake Swap’s NFT Market can be allocated to this pool.
 
3- Holding a Cake burning competition so that the first to one hundred on the leaderboard can get special permission to participate in the next IFO. For example, they can be dedicatedly allowed to buy 5% of the next IFO in proportion to their rank.


4- A specefic amount of IDO can be dedicated to participant of this pool as airdrop.

5- Redirect specific percent of Cake injecting to lottary to this pool as Airdrop.

And so on.

Conclusion:

This, along with other Cake-burning mechanisms, can cause not only the APY not to decrease, but even increase if the growth of the cake gets negative.

A brief description of the Burning pool:
I consider this pool to be a one-sided, means, we can only stake. It will be a pool where anyone can stake as much as they want and can specify how much of cake be burnt weekly (on the time of staking). Alex, for instance, wants to contribute 21 Cake to the Burning pool, he specifies 3 Cakes burn at time of staking (means he participated in this pool for 7 weeks and benefits from its incentives during this period). He, also, does not have to add cake to the Burning pool every week which helps him to have consistent profit. (note weekly staking also possible)

And the last thing is all the fees related to staking Cakes in this Pool will be spent on buying back Cakes from market and burning it.

I would kindly ask Pancake Swap developers offering this as a core proposal if members agreed with the outline.",bullish,13.96,2021-11-24 18:19:46+00:00,14.69,14.69,2021-11-26 00:00:00+00:00,5.2292263610315,13.635,-0.0232808022922636,0.8963875472545624,True," The text describes a proposal within the Pancake Swap community to create a Burning pool aimed at reducing or even achieving negative inflation rate of Cakes, their native token. This is achieved by encouraging Cake holders to voluntarily deposit and burn their tokens weekly. In return, participants are offered various rewards such as Syrup pool tokens, rare NFTs, special privileges in future IFOs, IDO airdrops, and lottery entries. The Burning pool operates on a one-sided staking model where users can specify how much of their Cake to burn weekly upon staking. All fees related to staking will be used to buyback and burn Cakes from the market. The author invites Pancake Swap developers to consider this proposal if it gains community approval. Overall, the sentiment is positive and optimistic about the potential impact of the Burning pool on the Cake's inflation rate and rewards for participants.",bullish,small

# What is Splinterlands?

Splinterlands is a unique digital trading card game that allows players to truly own their cards and other in-game assets. Thanks to web 3.0 technology powered by the HIVE blockchain, each card in Splinterlands is   a non-fungible token owned by a player. That means that players can do anything they want with their cards, including battling for rewards, holding as collectibles, trading on the peer-to-peer market, combining to level up, or even burning to obtain Dark Energy Crystals, the official in-game cryptocurrency of Splinterlands.

With hundreds of unique cards, Splinterlands is a brilliantly designed and fast paced trading card game that allows its players to earn by playing. Unlike more traditional TCGs like Magic: The Gathering and Pokemon, Splinterlands battles are fast, with each match taking only 2-3 minutes. Rather than turn-based action in which every move is carefully and slowly controlled, Splinterlands' main mechanic is a drafting style. Once an opponent is found, each player assembles a team of up to 6 cards from their Splinterlands collection. Then according to a unique set of rules that make every match different, the battle is played out automatically in a quick action-packed format that allows players to learn from both victory and defeat.

Splinterlands is a strategist's dream, beloved by one of the largest and most loyal followings in the play-to-earn industry. It is translated into nearly a dozen languages and played in over 100 countries worldwide. Each day, thousands of cards are traded for thousands of dollars on the peer 2 peer monster market. Join the fight at Splinterlands.com.

809,1461,3991,3991,3991,2022-03-31 09:17:52+00:00,pankcakeswap,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

One thing that is always unclear to people when reviewing these proposals is that we aren't ""removing"" rewards from the farm itself.

The purpose is to redirect CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value.

#### Hopefully, this example might be better:

-   Under performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (10 CAKE)
    

1x multiplier removed from under performing farm

-   Under performing farm = 0x (0 CAKE)
-   High performing farm = 1x (20 CAKE)
    

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more space to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Ankr! Ankr is a decentralized Web3 infrastructure provider, powering a network of community RPC nodes and supporting BNB Liquid Staking. Stakers can stake BNB on Ankr and get a Ankr Reward Bearing Staked BNB token (aBNBc). 

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn $ANKR tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 8,000,000 ANKR
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 22 Apr 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 21 Jun 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 4.6296 ANKR

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the $ANKR Syrup Pool, we propose a aBNBc-BNB farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the boosted period if it underperforms its peers via such metrics: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc. 
 
#### What is $ANKR?

From the team: “Ankr is a decentralized blockchain infrastructure provider that operates an array of nodes globally distributed across over 50 Proof-of-Stake networks. This infrastructure helps drive the growth of the crypto economy while powering a full suite of multi-chain tools for Web3 users, such as liquid staking.

ANKR is the native utility token needed for transactions and payments for many of Ankr’s services as well as platform governance.”

#### What is $aBNBc?

From the team: “aBNBc is Ankr’s liquid staking reward bearing token. Over time, the redemption ratio grows, so 1 aBNBc > 1 BNB. aBNBc can be obtained by participating in Ankr’s [**BNB Liquid Staking**](https://www.ankr.com/earn/stake/bnb/). An overview of how Ankr’s BNB Liquid Staking works can be found [**here**](https://www.ankr.com/docs/earn/liquid-staking/bnb/overview).”

- What does it mean?

Well, let's say we have a new pair that will be added in the Syrup Pool.

That particular pair will accept at maximum 10,000 staked CAKE. That means, if it reach that amount, new people will not be able to stake on that pair and it will become ""Full"".

- What's the reason to limit the staked CAKE amount on a pair?

As you may know, the less staked CAKE on a pair, the higher is the APR. And if the max. amount is reached, the APR becomes fixed. That's why it is called ""Fixed APR Staking"".

The goal here is to make staking a little bit fun, that means when a new pair is added, people should hurry and get on it as fast as they can to be the lucky staker on that pair and enjoy the higher APR rewards. You can call it like a ""Challenge"" or ""Comptetition"".

 - **Finish time:** Approx. 11AM UTC on May 23rd 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 3.404 FROYO 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the $FROYO Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide a FROYO-CAKE farm. The farm will have 1x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.5x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the farm period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.

#### What is $FROYO?

From the team: “FROYO is the native token of the Froyo Games platform and the primary medium of transaction across all of its offerings, including but not limited to the Froyo NFT Marketplace and inside of the various Play-to-Earn games coming to the platform. Its supply is limited to 1,000,000,000 FROYO with no contract function to mint or burn any additional tokens. 

FROYO will also be used to purchase tickets on the Froyo Gamebox to enter into competitive mini-games with real prizes. In the future, $FROYO tokens can also be staked via the $veFROYO mechanism to earn more $FROYO tokens collected from fees and revenue of platform services, tokens from upcoming game releases and NFT airdrops for new games coming to the platform.”

Yes, you read that right! Today we’re switching things up and announcing our intention to host both a reverse Syrup Pool in which you can stake AXS to earn CAKE tokens and a regular Syrup Pool where you can stake CAKE to earn AXS tokens!

# Why AXS? 

Raise your hands if you’ve played Axie Infinity! As one of the hottest blockchain games currently, Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired digital pet universe built on the Ethereum blockchain where anyone can earn token rewards through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem.

# The Syrup Pools:
Stake AXS tokens to earn CAKE tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 4,000 CAKE (Approx. $50K worth)
- **Distribution duration:** 14 days
- **Start block:** 9375400 (approx. 9am UTC on July 22nd)
- **Finish block:** 9778600 (approx. 9am UTC on August 5th)
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.00992 CAKE

## Max Stake per wallet: 
25 AXS (approx. $460) 

Stake CAKE tokens to earn AXS tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 3,000 AXS (Approx. $50K worth)

- **Start block:** 9375400 (approx. 9am UTC on July 22nd)
- **Finish block:** 9778600 (approx. 9am UTC on August 5th)
- **Token rewards per block:** 0.00744 AXS


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE


“But where will the CAKE and AXS for these rewards come from, Chef?”
Simple. We will use Treasury funds and buy CAKE and AXS tokens for these Syrup pools, 	from the market.


# The Farm:
In addition to the Syrup Pool, we are hosting an AXS-BNB farm that will have 1x farm multiplier in CAKE rewards. Remember, liquidity means less slippage, more trading volume and more CAKE burned as a result!


# What is Axie Infinity?

Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired digital pet universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets (known as Axies). Currently, players can start the game by purchasing Axies from other players on the Marketplace.

All in-game assets and Axie-related data can be accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe.

The project team aims to build a platform that encompasses the characteristics of a social network and jobs platform by creating a strong community and play-to-earn opportunities.

#### PancakeSwap and Token Supply

The state of DeFi and PancakeSwap has changed immensely since our inception in September 2020, and we propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750,000,000 (750M) to better reflect our long-term outlook on PancakeSwap and the $CAKE token.

#### Current PancakeSwap Tokenomics

In the kitchen, we have been working hard to bring value to PancakeSwap and the $CAKE token, from providing new products (e.g. Perpetuals), to sourcing the tastiest Syrup Pools and Farms. Unique amongst AMMs, we also burn transaction fees from platform activities (e.g. trading, prediction, farm auctions) to further increase the scarcity of the $CAKE token.

**But we can do better, and we will.**

#### Proposed Cap on CAKE Maximum Token Supply

We propose to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M $CAKE. Based on our calculations – which can be found in detail in our [**litepaper v2**](https://v2litepaper.pancakeswap.finance/) – this comfortably gives us an approximate runway of 3 years, before the current circulating supply reaches this cap. 

We believe that implementing this proposed cap will enable the $CAKE token to better reflect the value, community, and sustainability of PancakeSwap.

#### What’s next?

If the community decides to approve the proposal to cap the CAKE maximum token supply at 750M, we will formally incorporate it into our tokenomics, and institute the max token supply cap.

# What is Tranchess?

[Tranchess](https://tranchess.com//) is a chess-themed DeFi Asset Management and derivatives trading protocol. The protocol seeks to provide a risk/return matrix from a single main fund, known as QUEEN, which tracks a specific underlying crypto asset. 

Launched on BSC on June 24th, its first fund allows BTC holders to earn extra yield via QUEEN creation. In addition, the fund attempts to serve a variety of clients with different risk tolerances-- users may split QUEEN into BISHOP, a USDC-denominated low-risk tranche, and ROOK, a leveraged tranche for BTC exposure. CHESS is Tranchess’ governance token.

Tranchess’ seed-round investors include Three Arrows Capital, Spartan Group, Binance Labs, LongHash Ventures, IMO Ventures etc.

CAKE holders, today we are very happy to be able to offer you a new Syrup Pool from **Bella Protocol**, an aggregated user interface for existing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. Bella Protocol aims to simplify the user experience of existing DeFi protocols, and to allow users to deploy their assets and earn yield with ease.



# What is Boost?
Boost is basically an increase in farm multiplier over a set period of time, which is offered in exchange for additional tokens from the boosted project, which are then put into a new Syrup Pool!

So basically, BEL-BNB will go to a 1x multiple, which will last for 7 days, and only cause temporary dilution among the other farms, and at the same time, there will be a new BEL Syrup Pool with $350k of tokens, to be earned by staking CAKE.



# The Syrup Pool:
Stake CAKE tokens to earn BEL tokens!

- **Total Tokens:** 175,000 BEL
- **Distribution duration:** 60 days
- **Start block:** 10189050 [**(approx. 9am UTC on August 20th)**](https://www.bscscan.com/block/countdown/10189050)

- **Token rewards per block:** 0.101 BEL


## Max Stake per wallet: 
100 CAKE for the first 48 hours, then unlimited CAKE staking afterwards. 

To give as many CAKE holders the opportunity to Farm some juicy pool rewards at a high APY, we will have a 100 CAKE token cap staking limit per user for the first 48 hours.

# What is Bella Protocol?

Bella Protocol aims to solve current pain points in the DeFi user experience, such as high gas fees and a steep learning curve, and to onboard more users into the DeFi ecosystem.

The introduction of vCAKE, alongside our already-implemented iCAKE, forms part of our strategy to continue to bring more benefits to our fixed-term CAKE holders and loyal CAKE family! 

We believe vCAKE will bring tremendous benefits not only to the fixed-term CAKE stakers but also to the overall CAKE ecosystem and ultimately benefit every CAKE holder. 

And this is only the beginning of the beautiful marriage of fixed-term CAKE staking and governance voting … We are already cooking more exciting dishes!

#### What is vCAKE?

vCAKE is a number representing the boosted voting power based on a user’s fixed-term CAKE staking position.

The vCAKE number will be added to your total voting power.

**Similar to iCAKE, vCAKE is NOT a new token.**

vCAKE IS NOT transferrable or tradeable. 

![](https://imgur.com/HhrKgdK.png) 

#### Why are we proposing vCAKE?

CAKE has been and will continue to be the essential element of PancakeSwap. Everything in PancakeSwap – from trading fee burns, to lottery and prediction, and our syrup pools – is built around CAKE. 

Importantly, from inception, CAKE has been playing another essential role that defines PancakeSwap –**governance and voting**. Every CAKE holder who has their CAKE in their wallet or staking in PancakeSwap CAKE/BNB farm, CAKE pool, and other syrup pools will be able to participate in the governance voting or create their very own community proposal for others to vote on.

Previously, the voting power has been 1:1 to the CAKE amount a user is holding. In April 2022, we introduced token locking with the brand new fixed-term CAKE staking pool. Like every other protocol with token locking, we feel it is not only logical but also essential to bring weighted voting power to those who are willing to lock their tokens for a longer period of time to better reflect and reward their loyalty to the project.

#### How is vCAKE calculated?

vCAKE is calculated based on two variables:

- The amount of CAKE located in the Fixed-Term Staking Pool
- The remaining lock durations of the staking positions

For point 2., it is important to clarify that the remaining lock duration is not (a) how many weeks you committed your CAKE for when you first locked it up (e.g. 52 weeks), but (b) the time remaining on your lock. In this case, if you locked CAKE for 52 weeks around 10 weeks ago, your remaining lock duration is 42 weeks, not 52 weeks.

If your remaining staking duration is less than one week, your vCAKE is equal to the amount of CAKE locked in the CAKE pool.

If your remaining staking duration is more than one week, your vCAKE is equal to the amount of CAKE locked, multiplied by the number of weeks left in the staking position.

**For example:**
- Alice locked 100 CAKE for 52 weeks; her staking position will unlock in 40 weeks. She has `100 x 40 = 4000 vCAKE`
- Bob locked 100 CAKE for 52 weeks; his staking position will unlock in 52 weeks. He has `100 x 52 = 5200 vCAKE`
- Carole locked 100 CAKE for ten weeks; and her staking position has ended. She has `100 vCAKE`

|        | # of CAKE in Fixed-Term Staking Pool | Remaining Lock Duration | vCAKE |
|:--------:|:--------------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------:|
| Alice  | 100                                  | 40 weeks                | 4000  |

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with OpenLeverage! 
OpenLeverage is a permissionless lending and margin trading protocol that enables users to long or short any token pair on decentralized exchanges.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn OLE tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 3,000,000 OLE
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 08 Jul 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 06 Sep 2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 1.7361 OLE 

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

In order to host the OLE Syrup Pool, we’ll need to provide an OLE-BUSD farm. The farm will have 0.5x CAKE rewards for the first 48 hours, then 0.1x rewards after that.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the farm period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.

#### What is $OLE?

From the team: “OpenLeverage is a permissionless margin trading protocol currently deployed on ETH, BNB, and KCC chains, supported by the Multichain bridge. Our protocol integrates with existing DEXs and allows users to trade assets with leverage. Traders can add any token pair on our platform and enter long/short positions (with up to 10x leverage), while lenders earn yield on deposited funds.


OLE can be earned from the protocol – e.g. trading, lending, and referral –, and can be paired with BUSD on a designated DEX (in this case, PancakeSwap) to obtain xOLE. 

xOLE holders enjoy the following utilities: boosted rewards for trading and lending; liquidity mining rewards, a share of trading fees, and governance. More details can be found [**here**](https://docs.openleverage.finance/main/rewards/staking-and-xole).”

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with pSTAKE.finance! 
PSTAKE is a liquid staking solution that unlocks the true potential of PoS tokens by unlocking liquidity of staked assets. 

Stakers can stake BNB on **https://app.pstake.finance/** after the mainnet is live on 08 Aug 2022 to receive pSTAKE’s Liquid Staking token for BNB, **$stkBNB**. 

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn PSTAKE tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 2,000,000 PSTAKE
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 09 Aug 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1100 UTC on 08 Oct  2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 1.1574 PSTAKE

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

For the PSTAKE Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing two farms. 

- **stkBNB-BNB farm**
The farm will have **1x CAKE rewards** for the first 48 hours, then **0.5x rewards** after that.
At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1100 UTC on 08 Oct 2022 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0.1x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.5x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues etc. 

- **PSTAKE-BUSD farm**
The farm will have **0.5x CAKE rewards** for the first 48 hours, then **0.1x rewards** after that.
At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1100 UTC on 08 Oct 2022 – the farm will have rewards removed unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.1x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues etc. 

#### What is $PSTAKE?

From the team: “Developed by Persistence, pSTAKE is a multi-chain liquid staking protocol that unlocks the liquidity of PoS assets by issuing staked representative tokens against users’ bonded assets, allowing them to earn DeFi yields on top of staking rewards. 

pSTAKE’s liquid staking solution is live on 4 chains, namely Cosmos, Ethereum, Persistence, and BNB Chain. Additionally, pSTAKE is in the process of developing liquid staking solutions for other leading assets in the industry.

$PSTAKE is the governance token of pSTAKE Finance – $PSTAKE holders can participate in protocol’s governance and protocol improvement proposals to ensure long term security of the protocol. $PSTAKE is used to align incentives of all the stakeholders within the PSTAKE ecosystem.”

#### What is $stkBNB?

From the team: “$stkBNB is the liquid staked representative for BNB. 

The stkBNB token supply will be driven by BNB staked with pSTAKE and the staking rewards earned. Users will be issued stkBNB based on an exchange rate model, inspired by the Compound’s cToken model. The value of stkBNB will keep increasing against BNB as it accrues staking rewards in the background, which will be reflected in the exchange rate (c-value). For more details, please [**read more here**](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/32880).

Users holding stkBNB can participate in DeFi protocols to generate additional yield on top of their staking rewards. pSTAKE will consistently keep adding more DeFi use-cases for stkBNB to expose stkBNB holders to multiple yield opportunities.”

This led me to believe that the PancakeSwap team cannot or finds it too risky to use their own capital in the win collumn, and I support this decision.

We can't have Blackjack or a dice game here because these games have a dealer, and thus requires capital that the PancakeSwap team cannot or finds it too risky to do.

However this is limiting the potential of the win collumn, so I propose a solution.

Make something similar to a staking pool (I'll call it the dealer pool from now on), but the funds gets used as the dealer's funds.

The profit from the dealer pool will be distributed to the users who have a stake on the dealer pool, of course loses will be deducted.

PancakeSwap gets a percentage of the profits from the dealer pool and will be used to burn CAKE, however PancakeSwap will not reimburse any users that have a stake on the dealer pool for any loses.

Gambling games always favor the dealer statistically, so the users who have a stake on the dealer pool can expect profits more than loses.

I believe that the best we can use as dealer funds in the dealer pool is BUSD or other stablecoins. Because we can already get yield from CAKE and stablecoins are well.. stable. This also gives users the ability to get yeild on their stablecoins.

If this is implemented we can get a lot more games on the win collumn and PancakeSwap's capital will not be at risk.

Users who stake their funds in the pool would receive profits (after losses are deducted), and PancakeSwap would get a percentage of the profits for CAKE burning. This setup, it's suggested, could bring more games to the win column, generate additional revenue for PancakeSwap, and benefit CAKE holders through increased burns.

![](https://imgur.com/Kiz4yhX.png)

If any of the terms are unclear, please ask our friendly community, or look at these articles on [**vesting**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/vesting-period).

# IFO Sale Details  
- **Sale start time:** ~1100 UTC on 4 Aug 2022 
- **Sale end time:** ~1200 UTC on 4 Aug 2022 
- **Amount to be raised:** $2,000,000 USD in CAKE tokens
- **Tokens to be sold:** 50,000,000 PEEL (5% of PEEL total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 PEEL = $0.040 USD
- **Token Vesting Schedule:** 30% will be unlocked at Sale end time (~1200 UTC), with the remaining 70% released block-by-block over 90 days.

All CAKE raised from the PEEL token sale will be given to the IFO project. Only CAKE raised from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Public Sale and Private Sale (Both conducted via the Overflow method).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

Basically, the more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent. More details below in the Overflow Multiplier Table.

# To participate in the IFO:

Refer to the [**IFO participation guide**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/ifo-initial-farm-offering/ifo-guide) and [**iCAKE article**](https://medium.com/pancakeswap/introducing-icake-ifo-updates-and-cake-side-pool-cc58983071d7).

**iCAKE and locked CAKE cannot be used to buy tokens in the IFO, so you would need a separate amount of CAKE to commit to the IFO.**

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Private Sale ($400,000, 20% of Sale allocation)

For the Private Sale, participants are required to own a [**Pancake Squad NFT**](https://pancakeswap.finance/pancake-squad), and [**set them as your Pancake Profile avatar**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/nft-profile-system/profile-guide). 

For this Private Sale, the maximum amount of funds that can be committed per user is **$800**, calculated based on the expected number of participants to ensure everyone can get a fair share.

The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session.

![](https://imgur.com/dpNPWkE.png)

#### Public Sale ($1,600,000, 80% of Sale Allocation)

As the name suggests, the Public Sale is open to all. However, this comes with a participation fee, which will be fully burned! 

The fee cliff for the PEEL IFO is as follows:

1. **PEEL Syrup Pool:** This pool allows users to stake CAKE tokens to earn PEEL tokens. The total supply of PEEL is 7,500,000 and the distribution will last for 60 days starting shortly after the Initial Farm Offering (IFO) ends. The rewards per block are 4.340 PEEL. The maximum stake per wallet is limited to 100 CAKE for the first 5 days, then unlimited thereafter. For the first 5 days, users need an active PancakeSwap Profile to stake in the IFO Syrup Pool.

2. **SHELL Syrup Pool:** Similar to the PEEL pool, this pool allows users to stake CAKE tokens to earn SHELL tokens. The total supply of SHELL is 155,000,000 and the distribution will also last for 60 days starting shortly after the IFO ends. The rewards per block are 89.699 SHELL. There is no maximum stake limit after the first 5 days.

To host these pools, PancakeSwap will provide a PEEL-BUSD farm and a SHELL-BUSD farm with specific CAKE reward rates for the initial 48 hours and thereafter.

The PEEL and SHELL tokens are associated with the MetaApes Game project. To learn more about the project, users can visit their official channels including the website, Twitter, Discord, Medium, and download the game from the App Store or Google Play Store.

It's important to note that BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING: PEEL tokens will not be available for trading before or during the IFO. Always verify the token address before buying tokens.

If any of the vesting terms are unclear, please ask our friendly community, or read this article on [**vesting**](https://t.co/h2EoYCwJPs).

# cIFO Sale Details  
- **Sale start time:** ~1200 UTC on Wed 21 Sep 2022 
- **Sale end time:** ~1400 UTC on Wed 21 Sep 2022 
- **Amount to be raised:** $1,191,575 USD in CAKE tokens
- **Tokens to be sold:** 21,665,000 HOOP (6.19% of HOOP total supply)
- **Price per token:** 1 HOOP = $0.055 USD
- **Token Vesting Schedule:** 25% will be unlocked at Sale end time (~1400 UTC), with the remaining 75% released block-by-block over 15 weeks.

All CAKE raised from the HOOP token sale will be given to the cIFO project. Only CAKE raised from the participation fee will be burnt.

Method: Public Sale and Private Sale (Both conducted via the Overflow method).

# What is the “Overflow” sale method?

Basically, the more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent. More details below in the Overflow Multiplier Table.

# To participate in the cIFO:

Refer to the [**IFO participation guide**](https://bit.ly/3CnhH6p) and [**iCAKE article**](https://bit.ly/3R0xNHj).

iCAKE and locked CAKE cannot be used to buy tokens in the cIFO, so you would need a separate amount of CAKE to commit to the cIFO. The iCAKE threshold for this cIFO will be publicised closer to cIFO date.

## An Explainer: What are the 2 different sale sessions?

#### Private Sale ($357,472.50, 30% of Sale allocation)

For the Private Sale, participants are required to: 
- Have ≥ **800** Points

As with all new features and products, this points cut-off of **800 points** may be re-adjusted in the future to optimize the performance of the cIFO product. 

For this Private Sale, the maximum amount of funds that can be committed per user is **$1,000**.

The final allocation you receive will still be subject to the total amount raised in this session.

![](https://i.imgur.com/N1sqBTO.png)

#### Public Sale ($834,102.50, 70% of Sale Allocation)

As the name suggests, the Public Sale is open to all. However, this comes with a participation fee, which will be fully burned! 

The fee cliff for the HOOP cIFO is as follows:

# The HOOP Farm:

We will host a **HOOP-BUSD farm** that will have 2x CAKE rewards for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 2 days,  1x CAKE rewards for the subsequent 144,000 blocks (approx. 5 days) and thereafter, 0.5x CAKE rewards.

At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1500 UTC on 21 Nov 2022 – the farm will have its rewards adjusted to 0.1x unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.5x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues etc.

1. **Private Sale**: This session is only accessible to users who have accumulated 800 points, which may change in the future. The maximum amount of funds that can be committed per user is $1,000. The final allocation received will depend on the total amount raised during this session.

2. **Public Sale**: This sale is open to all participants but requires a participation fee, which will be burned. There's an overflow multiplier for the HOOP cIFO that affects the number of tokens each participant receives based on their commitment. The Public Sale accounts for 70% of the total token allocation.

Additionally, there are other ways to earn HOOP tokens:
- **The HOOP Syrup Pool**: Stake CAKE tokens to earn HOOP during a 60-day period. For the first 5 days, you need an active PancakeSwap Profile to stake in the cIFO Syrup Pool. After that, there's no requirement for a PancakeSwap Profile.
- **The HOOP Farm**: A HOOP-BUSD farm will be hosted with varying CAKE rewards over time. The rewards will adjust at the end of the 60-day period unless certain metrics are comparable with other farms.

Please note that the farm is subject to multiplier adjustments during or after the boosted period if it underperforms its peers via metrics like average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, fundamental token issues, etc.
 
At the same time, there will be a delicious, new HIGH Syrup Pool with 230,300 HIGH tokens to be earned by staking CAKE. Get your CAKE ready!

PUSD's market cap will be controlled for CAKE and PancakeSwap's safety and future.

PUSD's marketcap will not be allowed to surpass 10% of CAKE's marketcap.

PUSD will only be sold on PancakeSwap.

To control PUSD's marketcap, once it's past the 10% limit, PUSD will be more expensive than a dollar. If PUSD gets bought for more than a dollar the added price will be used to buy CAKE then burned. One PUSD will keep getting more expensive relative to the dollar as the percent of PUSD's market cap goes up further to the 10% limit.

One PUSD is exchangeable for 1 dollar worth of cake and vice versa in normal circumstances, but if PUSD's market cap goes up the 10% limit, exchanging 1 CAKE (let's say 1 CAKE is 10$) for PUSD will not give 10 PUSD because it's up the limit. However 10 PUSD can be exchanged for more than one CAKE, if the price is above a dollar, this will still have the fee.

Selling PUSD for CAKE will have a 1% fee, but buying PUSD does not. Fee will be used to burn CAKE.

Dear CAKE holders, we’re proud to announce a new Syrup Pool with Outer Ring MMO! 
Outer Ring is a third person massively multiplayer online game (MMORPG). Inside this open-world video game, players will hunt for NFT loots, take part in huge player versus player (PvP) and player versus environment (PvE) battles, and collect weapons, gears, and spaceships.

#### The Syrup Pool:

Stake CAKE tokens to earn GQ tokens!

 - **Total Tokens:** 96,154,000GQ
 - **Distribution duration:** 60 days
 - **Start time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 8 Sep 2022
 - **Finish time:** Approx. 1200 UTC on 7 Nov  2022
 - **Token rewards per block:** 55.64 GQ

#### Max Stake per Wallet:

100 CAKE for the first 57,600 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the Syrup Pool is launched, then unlimited CAKE staking after that.

The cap is to give everyone an equal opportunity to farm rewards at a high APY at the start of the farm.

#### The Farm:

For the GQ Syrup Pool, we’ll be providing a GQ-BUSD farm.  


The farm will have **0.2x CAKE rewards** for the first 48 hours, then **0.1x rewards** after that.
At the end of the 60-day period – approx. 1200 UTC on 7 Nov 2022 – the farm will be re-adjusted to a 0x multiplier unless the following metrics is comparable with other 0.1x multiplier farms: average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain, and there are no fundamental token issues etc. 

#### What is $GQ?

From the team: “Galactic Quadrant (GQ) is the governance token of Outer Ring MMO. It allows holders to influence the game through its governance platform directly. It is the main element of the player driven economy, and can be obtained by completing quests, competing, or trading in-game assets with other players.”

929,1697,4572,4572,4572,2022-09-07 08:43:13+00:00,pankcakeswap,"#### Proposal for Adjustments to Farm Rewards

Firstly, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to farms – the per block allocation to Farms and Lottery will remain at [**3.75 CAKE/block**](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/Qme8aLLxh7UeAmiAxcUie7FWvSrBYdmNMFtHhGdMTFEFKX).

Importantly, the purpose of these proposals is to **redirect** CAKE rewards given to farms that are underperforming and give them to farms that are providing the most value. In other words, redistributing farm rewards from the farms mentioned below will boost APRs for all other farms. 

By boosting APRs for higher-performing farms, we are able to encourage higher volume and liquidity, ultimately leading to greater trading fee revenue and therefore CAKE burns.

**This allows us to ensure that CAKE emissions are distributed in a sustainable and beneficial manner.**

#### Example of Adjustment

(Figures are for illustration purposes only.)

Over a certain time period,


- Under performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (10 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE**

After 1x multiplier removed for under performing farm,

- Under performing farm receives 0x (0 CAKE)
- High performing farm receives 1x (20 CAKE)

Total Amount of CAKE distributed to farms: **20 CAKE (no change)** 

#### Adjustment Details

So, with the above in mind, we're proposing to reduce CAKE rewards on the farms mentioned below, which will mean those rewards will be distributed back across all other existing farms, in addition to giving us more capacity to add more new Syrup Pool/farm combos etc.

The reason the below farms have been highlighted is due to their low ranking on our performance index which ranks each project using metrics like their reward multiple, average daily volume, 14-day volume, unique token holders on BNB Chain etc.

Balancer recently [launched](https://op.beets.fi/#/pools) on Optimism in collaboration with BeethovenX. This deployment will soon utilize veBAL gauges for BAL emissions so it is important that BAL maintains adequate liquidity and price equivalence with Ethereum. To get around the 7 day withdrawal period on the official Optimism bridge which breaks the necessary arbitrage loop with Ethereum I have enlisted the help of [Multichain](https://multichain.xyz/). They have added support for BAL between Ethereum and Optimism, however [it requires liquidity to be functional](https://docs.multichain.org/for-partners/for-partners/faq).

Thus, I propose allocating BAL from the treasury for this purpose. Please see the poll at the bottom which will serve as a temp check on the amount. Note that we would earn [bridge fees](https://medium.com/multichainorg/anyswap-fees-explained-bceddf535b83) on any funds deposited for bridge liquidity.

The treasury [currently holds ~4M BAL](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f/balances) so you can calculate the impact to the treasury from there depending on your poll choice.

# Risk

* Multichain is exploited and our BAL is lost. You can find information about [their security model here](https://docs.multichain.org/getting-started/security/security-model).

* Users only bridge in one direction, i.e. Optimism-> Ethereum and instead use the official bridge for Ethereum-> Optimism. This would see bridge liquidity on one side drained and we would be unable to withdraw our BAL until this was resolved somehow.

# Specification

If approved, 40,000 BAL would be sent from the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` to the LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` and deposited 50/50 on both sides of the bridge.",bullish,7.48,2022-06-09 13:44:24+00:00,8.0,8.0,2022-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,6.951871657753999,6.675,-0.107620320855615,0.866701602935791,True," The text discusses a proposal to allocate BAL from the treasury for liquidity on Multichain, a platform that facilitates asset transfer between Ethereum and Optimism networks.

**Summary:**

> Ankr proposes to the Balancer community the creation of an Ankr/ankrETH on Arbritrum with the Auto-bribing feature.
> ankrETH is a form of ETH Liquid Staking from Ankr Staking that offers instant liquidity for your staked ETH, enabling you to connect your ankrETH tokens with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards with auto-bribes.
> Ankr is a leader in RPC nodes with projects like Aave, 1inch and SushiSwap as clients and has ~$100M TVL across the Liquid Staking Offering.

**Protocol Description:**

> Ethereum Liquid Staking as provided by Ankr Staking offers instant liquidity for your staked ETH, enabling you to connect your ankrETH tokens with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards.
> ankrETH is a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 ankrETH token vs. ETH increases over time as staking rewards accumulate.

**Motivation:**

> The purpose of this proposal is to allow this pool to qualify for BAL incentive distribution in order to deepen the liquidity on Balancer and allow for users to swap ankrETH, the ETH Liquid Staking Asset, for ETH with the help of Auto-bribes on hidden hand.
> The intuition behind this is to remedy the capital inefficiency associated with providing liquidity since ankrETH is generating a yield from the Staking Rewards of ETH. As a result, users have an opportunity cost when providing liquidity since the other half of the ETH they provide does not generate any yield.
> Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to utilize BAL incentives,Swap Fees and auto-bribes in order to mitigate this capital inefficiency effect.

**Specifications:**

> 1. **Governance:** ANKR token-holders can propose and vote for changes to the Ankr Staking system. If a change receives enough votes, the Ankr team implements the agreed-upon changes to the platform. Further information may be found here: ANKR Governance Mechanics – Ankr

Summary:

Xave Finance (pronounced “Save Finance”)  has built an FX optimized AMM on top of the Balancer v2 Vault, the ""FXPools"". Xave is quickly progressing in its mission to bring liquid FX to the Balancer ecosystem. 

As of Nov ’23, Xave has facilitated ~$50M in stablecoin FX, has held an average of ~$3M fiat stablecoin TVL and is hitting ~$1.8M / wk in FX vol representing roughly 30% MoM growth. 

Xave is proposing to re-add the following gauges into the veBAL system, given these stablecoin pairs were successfully approved for gauges prior. Xave had to migrate LPs into new FXPools, thus the need for a new set of gauges to re-enable veBAL emissions for these stablecoin currency pairs. See our [Medium article](https://medium.com/xave-finance/bug-report-incident-response-004562ee1aae) describing the bug, response and fix for more information.

# Summary

As a recap, on 13 April 2022, a [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-incorporation-of-the-balancer-foundation/2989) was brought to the BalancerDAO (or the “DAO”) to incorporate the Balancer Foundation (or the “Foundation”). The Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work, furthering Balancer’s decentralization goals, and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.

The Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate, and provides, among others, two primary benefits:

It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts. In addition, for example, it intends to establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto.

It encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, it could engage business development or tech providers.

In short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the BalancerDAO in the structure of the traditional business world.

The Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.

Running a Foundation Company comes with certain real-world costs and financial reserve requirements. These are laid out below, first in summary and then in detail for reference.

## Specification - Foundation Expenses and reserves

This proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2022 running through March 2023, and a self-insurance reserve.

### Foundation Expenses

The summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.

The Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, so April / May /June is the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, although it is the first quarter for which funding is requested.

1. Q2 FY22 - USDC 32,941 - actual expenses incurred through the end of May 2022 and forecast for June 2022 - immediate payment requested
2. Q3 FY22 - USDC 67,919 - for transfer 25 June 2022
3. Q4 FY22 - USDC 67,969 - for transfer 25 September 2022
4. Q1 FY23 - USDC 78,384 - for transfer 15 December 2022

The table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter. Descriptions for each line item are included under the “Detail” section further below.

![|624x417.174903581549](upload://vPqyfiEv162ngVFJ64ipxJDv5Ii.jpeg)

### Foundation Self Insurance Reserve

As part of this proposal, we are asking BalancerDAO to hold the equivalent of US$500,000 as a self-insurance reserve, earmarked for a year and to be revisited after a year. The reserve can be maintained in BAL tokens given current market conditions, but must at all times be available to the Foundation should it be needed, and must be maintained at an equivalent value of US$500,000. More on this reserve requirement can be found in the “Detail” section below.

Note: the proposal is for funding at the Balancer Foundation level, it does not include funding for:

1. Balancer OpCo Limited, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) subsidiary and operating company that will house the front-end development team for BalancerDAO,
2. Other third-party service providers to the BalancerDAO, such as Orb Collective and Kolektivo Labs.

Proposals for funding these three entities will follow separately.

0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693

# Detail

For reference, please see below descriptions of the individual line items.

## Annual Secretary Fee

Under Cayman Law, a foundation company must at all times have a secretary who is a 'qualified person' (i.e. a person licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services). The secretary has a duty to ensure that the company complies with applicable Cayman Islands legislation governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.

Neither the secretary fee nor the registered office fee includes the preparation of minutes and resolutions. The Foundation will prepare these for typical matters but might seek assistance from Campbells if complex matters arise.

These fees are due in January each year.

## Registered Office and Registrar of Companies fees (via Campbells Corporate Services Cayman)

Annual registered office and registrar fee – US$2,915.12, which consists of:

- Registered Office fee of US$ 1,495.00

- Beneficial Ownership Reporting and Register Maintenance Fee of US$225.00

- Economic Substance Notification Fee of US$125.00

- Registrar Annual Return Fee of US$853.66

- Supplementary Registered Office License Fee of US$91.46

- Sundry Disbursements of US$125.00

Includes:

- providing the registered office and registered agent

- maintaining the statutory registers

- preparation and submission of annual returns

- filing economic substance notifications

- maintaining the UBO register and reporting on the same

These fees are due in January each year.

## Additional Campbells Corporate Services costs

Any legal advice that may be requested from time to time will be charged on a time spent basis. Any additional corporate requests (for example, requests for certificates, certified documents, updates to registers, filing changes, mail forward, etc – these are all in addition to the annual fees) will also be charged separately.

## Governance/Supervisory Services

### Non-Executive Director and Supervisor Responsibilities

Under the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.

“Supervisor”, for a foundation company, means a person, other than a member, who under the foundation company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.

The non-executive director responsibilities are:

* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors
* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation
* To work with the wider board of directors to:
  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;
  * set an agenda for board meetings;
  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate
* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate
* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission
* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary
* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director
* Set the tone to involve the Balancer ecosystem in developing long-range programs to support and increase all types of contributions to Balancer projects
* Set the tone to harmonize the ecosystem working with the board, the service providers, and projects and adjacent foundations to find opportunities to collaborate and reduce confusion.

### Community Board Member duties

The Directors have ultimate responsibility for the management of the Foundation. In particular, the Director’s responsibilities will include:

* complying with all reasonable requests, instructions and regulations made or given by the Board (or by any duly authorized committee thereof) and give to the Board such explanations, information, and assistance the Board may reasonably require

* attending all meetings of the Board in person or by video/phone; provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary, as applicable, with reasonable advance notice; and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances;

* bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO, strategy, policy, resources, performance, and regulatory matters;

* providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, adherence to terms set forth in the Articles;

* planning, developing, and enhancing the future strategic direction of the DAO

* sharing responsibility with the other director(s) of the Company for the effective management of the Company

### CEO/Management duties

The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Foundation, which includes the following roles:

1. Liaising with the board on all budgets, project proposals, and matters particularly as it relates to service providers including the BVI subsidiary

* Reporting to the board in a timely manner on all matters of importance including financial status, funding projections, policy setting, planning, program operations, employee matters, and the long-term health of the ecosystem.
* Providing adequate materials and analysis to assist the board in making decisions on all matters of importance.

2. Manage Finances and Service Providers

* Overseeing all financial management of the Foundation, including budgets for Board approval, grant, and funding administration required by either the Foundation or other supporters. Possessing thorough knowledge of all funding sources and required records.
* Maintaining and adapting the organizational structure and systems capable of meeting the needs of the Foundation in carrying out its mission.
* Overseeing BVI subsidiary operations including staff and logins as needed (Twitter, GitHub, Discord). Contracts with BVI for service providers.
* Setting up and administering the Foundation’s bank account
* Setting up and managing token custodian

3. Involving the board, ecosystem participants, service provider staff as needed in developing organizational goals, a strategic plan, and projections for supporting the Balancer mission through service providers (Orb Collective Inc and BVI subsidiary) and the community.

* Overseeing vendors & others involved in actively seeking software and product developments and funds as needed.
* Ensuring that the Balancer projects delegated to service providers and the ecosystem have clear objectives that are within the scope of the resources and mission of the Foundation.
* Overseeing the gathering, analysis, and reporting of data illustrating the work accomplished by service providers to manage performance and deliverables
* Reviewing program evaluation results and developing and executing strategies for continual improvement.

4. Compliance

* Responsible for all necessary filings, responses to inquiries, management of AML Compliance vendor, and other Cayman Foundation compliance and risk-related matters

5. and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation.

## Legal Counsel

The Foundation may from time to time require advice on matters of Cayman law. It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item. We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter. For clarity, this refers to the legal team rather than the corporate services team.

## Self Insurance

It is typical for an organization to obtain insurance to protect itself against the legal, regulatory and operational risks, as well as to protect the directors and officers from personal liability for carrying out their duties. We have not seen reasonable insurance for organizations of this nature in the market, hence the need to self-insure.

We are asking for $500,000 based on the costs of defending Balancer in the event of a regulatory inquiry, class action or other lawsuit or vulnerability to the ecosystem. The self-insurance is based on recent DeFi matters within the last 12 months which have cost on average $100,000 monthly to defend. It is important to note, that we have excluded any reserve for payment of damages, fines, or impact on users.

Since this is a reserve and not an expense, the Directors may assess in the future that a lower reserve amount becomes sufficient and propose changes to the DAO. We are asking that the DAO bookmarks these funds to hold for self-insurance.

## Bank Fees

The Foundation is working to establish a bank relationship that we are advised could take approximately 6-8 weeks once the application is complete and submitted. This line item is an estimate/placeholder for monthly fees

## Accounting Software

Estimate for monthly software subscription fees.

## Domain hosting, email document management solution

The Director is responsible for bringing independent judgment to issues affecting the company, providing advice on all matters, planning the future strategic direction, sharing management responsibility with other directors, and attending meetings unless prevented by illness or other reasonable circumstances.

The CEO is in charge of day-to-day management, liaising with the board, managing finances and service providers, developing organizational goals, overseeing vendors, ensuring compliance, and other duties as requested by the Foundation.

The document also mentions the need for legal counsel, self-insurance, bank fees, accounting software, and domain hosting costs. The self-insurance is set at $500,000 to cover potential legal and regulatory risks, with a monthly average of $100,000 estimated for defense costs in case of lawsuits or vulnerabilities.

The document does not provide specific details about the nature of the organization, its mission, or the Balancer ecosystem it is part of. However, it appears that the Balancer Foundation is seeking to establish a legal and financial structure for managing its operations, including budgeting, project proposals, service providers, compliance, and risk management.",bullish,high

Defillama: [DOLA: TVL and stats](https://defillama.com/stablecoin/dola)

**Protocol Description:**

Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.

Inverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;

* On the supply side of money markets by Inverse Finance's “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.
* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA-3POOL through our partnership with Yearn (currently $93M TVL).
* Via purchase with DAI stablecoin using[ The Stabilizer](https://www.inverse.finance/swap/DAI/DOLA).

DOLA is not ""algorithmic"" and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.

**Motivation:**


The Inverse Finance Team aims to be a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions utilizing Redacted Cartel’s Hidden Hand (“HH”) platform to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. 

Current onchain liquidity for INV-DOLA is sitting at just over $800,000 between Sushi and Uni LP. The Sushi pool is incentivized through our own platform with around 950 INV per month (~$75,000 at current prices) in rewards and this has brought $366,000 in depth. This is a poor return, which we believe is due to our platform, Frontier, not having borrows active since June 2022. We believe we can achieve much better ‘ROI’ by migrating INV-DOLA liquidity to Balancer and making full use of the bribe efficiency of the Aura / Balancer platforms, this is as there are way more users checking the platform regularly for yield opportunities. 

Once the 50/50 INV-DOLA pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer.


**Specifications:**

You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    

Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to the DOLA-3CRV[ Curve](https://curve.fi/factory/27) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. This includes[ Frontier](https://www.inverse.finance/frontier) and any lending market officially partnered with Inverse Finance. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

A custom INV oracle with both a price ceiling and borrow cap feature has been in use following a price manipulation[ incident on April 2nd](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/our-plan-making-good). This oracle has been reviewed by Peckshield and is actively managed by Inverse’s Risk team.

Inverse Finance’s new lending market is due to release later this year after audits and will use ChainLink price oracles. Inverse Finance's old lending market relied on both ChainLink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable.

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

Inverse DAO has recently established a working relationship with Peckshield. A first round audit of a recent product was produced ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWNG08mib2GcI1WqnMt5IdFoW73QU2F8/view?usp=sharing)), and an audit of relevant legacy code is in progress. The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. A recent announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:

* Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.
* Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.
* Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 9 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.
* Fed Chair: 2 of 5 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts.

Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).

DOLA stablecoin is fully decentralized, with no possibility to pause or blacklist any addresses, even if INV governance wanted to do so.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

Inverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the “Feds”, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLA’s Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. Please see our graph below of DOLA’s peg YTD.![|689x138](upload://s74SFpZeIWsGgZeDWzoPMZIgTV9.png)
 
6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)

The old lending market has been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable.

2. **Audits:** Audit reports can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWNG08mib2GcI1WqnMt5IdFoW73QU2F8/view?usp=sharing) and [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group). The DAO also has a dedicated Risk Working Group overseeing security practices.

3. **Centralization vectors:** Certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances are given to working groups within the DAO, but all granted privileges can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. The DOLA stablecoin is fully decentralized.

4. **Market History:** DOLA was launched in February 2021 and has shown resilience in maintaining its USD peg even during times of extreme stress. There have been two brief instances of depeg due to 3Pool bank runs on April 2nd and June 16th.

5. **Value:** This pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for INV on decentralized exchanges.

6. **Expected Value Add to Balancer:** The pool is expected to generate consistent fees as it serves as the primary source of liquidity for INV on decentralized exchanges.

The underlying tokens are USDC, DAI, and USDT. These will each be wrapped through Sturdy's stable coin lending market to earn LPs additional yield. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. The gauge can be uncapped based on the contents being all large cap stable tokens. Sturdy offers a WETH lending markets as well, but the natural first step is to work with stable tokens. This diversifies the options for stablecoin LPs on our platform to optimize their positions.

**Protocol Description:**

> Sturdy finance utilizes a leveraged borrowing market in order to earn the lenders  returns for their user’s to deposit digital assets and receive yield. Borrowers then can use the funds on whitelisted farms on several protocols, Balancer being one of them. The farming rewards are then split between lenders and borrowers. More information on Sturdy's structure strategies can be seen [here](https://docs.sturdy.finance/overview/collateral-staking-strategies). USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO. USDT is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Tether.

**Motivation:**

> Balancer’s ability to increase capital efficiency using linear and boosted pools is taking shape across the protocol. This Sturdy boosted pool fits Balancer’s initiative to be a protocol where LPs can safely tap into external yield sources, while maintaining effective liquidity for swapping. This will earn both LPs and the DAO yield and provide Idle with a place for their wrapped tokens to easily be swapped and deposited as the pool increases in TVL.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** USDC are centralized and does not have a governance forum. DAI is collateralized by MakerDAO. Sturdy's governance details can be seen [here](https://sturdyfinance.medium.com/strdy-tokenomics-13d06233cab1). Their token has not yet been released. 
2. **Oracles:** This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned.
3. **Audits:** See Sturdy's [here](https://docs.sturdy.finance/risk/security-and-audits)
4. **Centralization vectors:** Sturdy's multisig signers are noted [here](https://docs.sturdy.finance/risk/multisig). 
5. **Market History:** See USDC [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/%5D(https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin)). 
6. **Value:** LPs & Balancer will earn the protocol fee on underlying bb-s-USD as well as swap fees. BIP-19 will incentivize TVL to continue to grow here with trading volume and this implementation will continue to draw in new volume, as well as showcase the power of these pool types.

937,1710,4612,4612,4612,2023-03-15 14:13:54+00:00,balancer,"### Motivation

The rise of zkEVMs is likely to be a major theme as head into the second half of 2023 and beyond. One of the most promising of these is [zkSync](https://zksync.io/) which has been under development for the last 4 years by Matter Labs. Many Balancer contributors have a keen interest in being early movers to the zkRollup/zkEVM narrative and have been closely following the progress of zkSync. As we approach the launch of the public network it's time for the community to assess if proceeding with a Balancer deployment makes sense.

You can go down the [list of projects](https://ecosystem.zksync.io/) expected to be in the zkSync ecosystem and there's many well known names. If this proposal passes our goal will be to arrive as early as possible, likely with only basic weighted & stable pools on launch day and no BAL emissions. We'd then assess the landscape for potential boosted pools as we get the veBAL integration online to enable emissions to begin. Notable Layer Zero is expected to support zkSync so we can expect cross chain gauge boosts to be available, thus allowing Aura to join us :slight_smile:

Obviously we're early to zkEVMss so it's hard to say who the winners will be and if zkSync will be among them. Ultimately it does not take much effort from us to do this deployment so in my mind it's prudent to be early and wrong versus risk being left behind as a latecomer. I want Balancer to be seen as an industry leader in embracing new technology and I think deploying to zkSync fits perfectly into that narrative.

### Specification

No particular on-chain action will be executed with this proposal. If approved, various Balancer contributors will work towards deploying to zkSync and being one of the very first apps available after the public launch.

**Summary:**

> This pool uses the ComposableStablePoolFactory-v3 1 which addresses the [reentrancy vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345) disclosed during February 2023. This gauge is uncapped, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329). This means 65% of 50% of yield generated by this pool is to be used for bribing for votes on it via [Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/balancer). The remaining 35% goes to Balancer DAO as revenue.

**Protocol Description:**

> This pool utilises wstETH and linear pool bb-a-wETH which deposits wETH into Aave v3 wETH reserve. The linear pool utilises a wrapper developed by Aave Companies.

**Motivation:**

> With the introduction of wstETH to Aave v3, the author expects users to deploy yield maximising strategies utilising the wstETH/wETH loop. This is expected to generate borrowing demand for wETH and deposit APR for those that deposit wETH into Aave v3.

**Summary**

This is a proposal to add a gauge for SILO/ETH 80:20 Pool that will serve as the base layer for Silo Finance’s veSILO governance module.

* Silo Finance has a large amount of POL in Balancer, earning incentives that are recycled through voting incentives for AURA and BAL holders to further bolster the pool liquidity. Silo Finance continues to increase its voting incentives over time as protocol revenue increases and is committed to support the Balancer ecosystem long-term.

* Silo Finance is a longtime partner of the Balancer DAO.

* Silo Finance core contributors have allocated roughly $1.4M~ of personal liquidity to the SILO/ETH 80:20 pool to help expand the governance base of SiloDAO.

**Protocol Description**

How does Silo Finance work?

Silo Finance is a lending market that allows users to lend and borrow any asset in a risk-isolated way through the use of bridge assets. Essentially, the protocol creates an individual lending market (or ‘silo’) for each token asset and connects all markets via bridge assets that serve as a protocol-wide accepted collateral. This design creates a security benefit where an exploit taking place in one market doesn’t spread to other markets like it is the case in traditional DeFi lending markets.

Silo Finance Facts

- Protocol is not upgradable (contracts are battle-tested since Aug. 2022)

- Non-custodial: Neither DAO or core team can ever take custody of user funds

- No multi-sigs: DAO controls limited admin functions

https://devdocs.silo.finance/protocol-architecture/system-roles

**State of $SILO liquidity**

Our two largest liquidity pools are Balancer 80:20 SILO-ETH and 50:50 SILO-ETH pools with total TVL ~ $2.2M. We conduct regular buybacks of $SILO using SiloDAO’s revenue directly from our balancer pools, increasing Balancer’s fee revenue. Additionally, we use part of revenues to increase our voting incentives to BAL and AURA holders

**Motivation**

An 80:20 pool confers lower IL exposure to LPs, allowing users to maintain greater upside exposure to the base asset. The upcoming veSILO tokenomics upgrade is designed around a locked version of 80:20 SILO-ETH BPT, similar to veBAL. Having a whitelisted gauge will provide greater incentives for $SILO holders to lock tokens which will allow additional locked TVL to flow to Balancer.

**Specifications**

Governance: Silo Finance is operated as a DAO and governance decisions are completely decentralized. SiloDAO is a Cayman Foundation operating under the name of Silo Labs. Token holders create proposals, on-chain and on Snapshot, to manage funds and affect changes to markets such as replacing oracles, updating interest model settings, etc.

Oracles: Silo’s lending markets currently use Uniswap v3, Balancer v2 and Chainlink oracles in order to read asset prices. This is required to gauge lending parameters such as LTV and Health Factors to allow liquidation of undercollateralized positions. We also have some custom Chainlink oracle implementations for assets with things like a rebasing index such as gOHM and wstETH. Users however are only exposed to the oracles that their particular market uses.

Audits & Formal Verification: Our audit reports from ABDK and Quantstamp as well as a Certora Formal Verification Report can be found here https://silopedia.silo.finance/security/audits-and-formal-verification

Centralization vectors: No, token holders are the only ones with any sort of control over the protocol but even then they are limited to only being able to update certain things like oracles, bridge assets, interest rates, LTV/LT settings, and protocol fees. Any changes made are also locked behind a TimeLock Controller, allowing users ample time to withdraw should they not agree with the aforementioned changes.

Market History: $SILO price had been seeing a lot of fluctuations given its limited DEX liquidity. We have been seeing positive price action and volume as of late as liquidity increased. Historically, the one sharp drop in token price happened as a result of the largest token holder then - large fund- going underwater in the aftermath of Terra collapse.

Value: Balancer has long been SILO’s liquidity hub and our 80:20 SILO:ETH Balancer pool will continue to be our primary source of liquidity for $SILO on Ethereum.

**Summary**
The ether.fi team proposes a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a weETH-rETH pool on Arbitrum, with a 10% emissions cap. This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.

```

**Protocol Description:**

ether.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.

ETH staked through the ether.fi liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on ether.fi automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols. 

The eETH contract has been live since June 2023, with eETH launching to the open market on November 15th, 2023, and has approx. 515k ETH held within it. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.

Through these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.

**Motivation:**

ether.fi is looking to seed a weETH/rETH pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for weETH on Arbitrum. Incentivising a Balancer pool will continue to boost the liquidity of the LRT on Arbitrum. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the L2 DeFi ecosystem. 

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** - Currently, the protocol utilises a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed ether.fi executives. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token.

2. **Oracles:** - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the ether.fi team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however as the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee.

* The exchange rate feed for weETH-ETH on Arbitrum has been deployed by Chainlink. 

3. **Audits:** - Audit reports for the ether.fi protocol are found on the GitBook page - [Audits - ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits). The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.

4. **Centralization vectors:** - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team at ether.fi, however this will be upgraded with the implementation of the ether.fi DAO and governance.

5. **Market History:** - eETH was first deployed November 15, 2023. Market history and protocol information can be found here on the ether.fi Dune dashboard - https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi

6. **Value:** - The weETH/rETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum. The pairing of eETH with rETH will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers.

## Summary

In this proposal, we seek to provide protocol owned liquidity to a 80BAL-20WETH:WETH 50:50 weighted pool on Ethereum. By providing this liquidity, we intend to improve pricing of the 80BAL-20WETH BPT and its dependent tokens like sdBAL and auraBAL while also utilizing otherwise idle BAL liquidity for the DAO.

## Motivation

veBAL is based on the locked 80BAL-20WETH balancer pool token (BPT). Many secondary locked versions of veBAL like sdBAL and auraBAL directly depend on pricing of said BPT as they are paired with this token (e.g. [80BAL-20WETH:auraBAL](https://zen.balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x3dd0843a028c86e0b760b1a76929d1c5ef93a2dd000200000000000000000249) Composable stable pool). One main issue is that there is no consistent pricing available for the 80BAL-20WETH BPT. By seeding a 80BAL-20WETH:WETH weighted pool, we can guarantee that more accurate pricing for the BPT can occur. As a result, many dependent tokens like auraBAL and sdBAL will benefit from optimized pricing. Finally, this provides an opportunity to utilize idle BAL and generate revenue as this pool will likely result in increased trading activity.

An example of price discrepancy issues is clearly visible on the price chart on Geckoterminal for the 80BAL-20WETH:auraBAL pool on mainnet. Note the price divergence on even small swaps in February

Beethoven-X utilized a [fBeets:USDC pool ](https://beets.fi/pool/0x2cea0da40cf133721377bb2b0bf4adc43715bfc30002000000000000000001e1)in the past to solve a similar problem. They were able to collect significant trading fees while also improving overall pricing of their assets, showcasing that such an approach has beneficial implications on the 8020-BPT. Beethoven-X DAO later removed POL based on the maBEETs token locking redesign. In the case of Balancer DAO, a pool matched with USDC would not result in the best outcome.

Therefore, the usage of a BAL8020:WETH pool would guarantee better trading routes with aggregators, assuming they have a correct setting for hop limits implemented (>=3). A potential route could then be WETH -> 80BAL-20WETH (via new pool) -> auraBAL(2 hops) without the need to perform a join / wrap for the aggregator. Another example would be USDC -> WETH (via USDC:WETH pool) -> 80BAL-20WETH -> auraBAL (3 hops)

## Execution Specification

To achieve better price stability, we intend to provide liquidity in a 80BAL-20WETH:WETH 50:50 weighted pool initially set at 1% dynamic swap fees with a POL target of $100,000 USD.

Given a BAL price of $1.82and WETH price of $2,454 we are requesting following amounts:

BAL: $40k / $1.82 = 21978 (50% * 80% = 40% of the $100k)

WETH: $60k / $2454 = 24.45 ((50% * 20%) + 50% = 60% of the $100k)

Derived from first composing a $50k 80BAL-20WETH position, which is then matched with $50k of WETH tokens as seen in this table:

|50%||50%|
|---|---|---|
|80BAL-20WETH|||
|BAL|WETH|WETH|
|21978|4.075|20.375|


## Risks

Given the structure of the pool design and amount of liquidity requested, there should be minimal impermanent loss occurring as these assets are highly correlated. The only risk being identified is wrong configuration of the payloads which can be mitigated by careful review and execution only after secondary and third party reviews.

## Protocol Description:

**About Inverse Finance**

Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a DAO and started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology.

Inverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;

* On the supply side of money markets, such as DAO-owned protocol FiRM, by Inverse Finance's “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.
* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA/FraxBP (currently $9.3M TVL), DOLA/USDC on Velodrome ($2.0M TVL), DOLA/USDC on Balancer ($1.1m TVL on ETH, $2.4m TVL on Arbitrum) and DOLA/USDbC on Aerodrome ($20.0m TVL).

DOLA is not ""algorithmic"" and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.

## Motivation:

We propose adding the pyUSD/sDOLA stable swap pool on Balancer to the gauge controller, a strategic enhancement for both Inverse Finance and Balancer ecosystems. sDOLA, a novel yield-bearing ERC-4626 stablecoin introduced by Inverse Finance DAO, exemplifies innovation in the stablecoin domain. Leveraging Balancer’s advanced capabilities in managing yield-bearing assets, this integration aims to catalyze a dynamic and mutually beneficial relationship.

Importantly, this pool also introduces PayPal’s pyUSD to the Balancer ecosystem for the first time, launched in August of 2023, pyUSD has already amassed a supply of over $300m. Inverse Finance seeks to partner with Trident Digital (managing the DeFi adoption of pyUSD) to build liquidity depth within this new pool jointly. We are looking forward to taking full advantage of growing a yield-bearing core pool in the Balancer ecosystem.

## Specifications:

You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.

> 1. Governance: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.

Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to pools such as the DOLA/FraxBP[ Curve](https://curve.fi/factory/27) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.

> 2. Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

Inverse Finance’s new fixed-rate money market, FiRM, uses Chainlink price feeds for all markets on FiRM, with some implementations also utilizing Curve EMA price feeds.

> 3. Audits: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

Inverse Finance has undergone multiple audits and bug contests, which can be found linked [here](https://www.inverse.finance/audits). sDOLA was audited by yAudit, which can be viewed [here](https://www.inverse.finance/audits/sDOLA-yAudit.pdf).

The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. An announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).

> 4. Centralization Vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:

* Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 5 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.
* Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.
* Policy Committee (PC): 4 of 8 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.
* Fed Chair: 2 of 7 Multisig with the operator role on DOLA Fed Contracts, which allows for DOLA to be expanded/contracted under the Fed smart contract logic (bounded by market conditions)

Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).

> 5. Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume

The DOLA stablecoin is soft pegged to $1, and like fully decentralized, over-collateralized stablecoins, can experience some volatility around this peg. Larger deviations (below $0.99) often recover fast due to the economic repegging mechanism built into the protocol (increasing borrowing cost on FiRM, AMM Fed contractions).

> This pool uses the composable stable pool factory and contains three unique staked ethereum tokens, staked frax eth (sfrxETH), wrapped staked eth from Lido (wstETH), and rocket eth from Rocket pool (rETH). As most Balancer community members know, rocket pool and lido have become pillars of the ecosystem through the use of the metastable / composable stable pool types to leverage their yield bearing assets. Staked frax eth will be joining these two juggernauts to facilitate trading and LPing amongst these diverse staking strategies of ETH. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.

**Protocol Description:**

> sfrxETH is a Frax's staked wrapped ETH token, wstETH is a wrapped staked ETH token for Lido, and rETH is the staked ETH token for Rocket Pool. 

**Motivation:**

> Balancer is clearly pushing forward on all networks with staked assets as a key focus. By diversifying the protocols which supply staked assets Balancer opens up the door to liquidity providers to gain exposure to multiple providers, while facilitating trade routes for these assets. The protocol benefits greatly from yield bearing assets, and Balancer's users do just as much. This pool will be a unique and diverse group of Ethereum assets making it exciting for everyone involved.

946,1722,4658,4658,4658,2022-02-24 12:04:39+00:00,balancer,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp-2-0/2548).

# Motivation 

Almost four months ago, Balancer’s governance process was formally overhauled and handed off to the DAO through [this proposal](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x3bbcaaad4f0a928b8dabaf97bfd9679752254aee6e63597df32a7453663354d6). Overall I would argue the revamp did increase the transparency and effectiveness of our governance process but some critical problems have become clear to me lately.

The ultimate authority of our governance process is BAL token holders. Currently, in order for a proposal to proceed for a vote it must have a majority of the Gov Council signal that the proposal has reached “soft consensus in the community”. Ballers and DAO contributors represent the majority of active community members. It’s not a stretch to imagine a scenario where large token holders support a proposal but the Ballers/active community do not. We have created a system where the Gov Council acts as gatekeepers with full control over what proceeds to a vote and what doesn’t.

Thus, I would make the argument that “soft consensus in the community” should NOT be a factor when considering a proposal to move forward to a vote. We must avoid the situation where core DAO contributors are against a proposal that has large token holder support, and that proposal does not proceed to a vote because it lacks “soft consensus in the community”.

# Specification

The Gov Council will remain in place and their approval will still be required for a proposal to move to a vote. However, they will not vote on whether “soft consensus in the community” has been reached. Instead, the question will be “Is this a well defined proposal?”

What is the criteria for a “well defined” proposal?

* Includes a “Motivation”, “Specification”, and if applicable a “Risks” section
* If on-chain execution from the DAO Multisig is required, the “Specification” section must contain transaction details (address to send funds to, contract to interact with/function to call, etc)
* The intent of the proposal must be clear (not spam)
* BAL token holders must have the power to implement the proposal
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deposit the FEI in our treasury into a new degen farm. As part of the [subDAO formation proposal](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66), the power to farm was delegated to the Treasury subDAO. BAL token holders cannot vote on how we farm with non-BAL treasury assets, so this proposal would not proceed to a vote. However, a proposal to remove the power to farm from the Treasury subDAO is within the scope of BAL token holders. If this proposal passes successfully, then the proposal to farm with FEI could go to a vote.
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deploy Balancer to Optimism. Balancer Labs has sole discretion over core protocol development. BAL token holders do not have the power to compel Balancer Labs to act. It is solely the choice of Balancer Labs to create an official deployment of Balancer on Optimism, or not. Thus, this proposal would not proceed to a vote as BAL token holders lack the power to implement it.
  * **Example**: A proposal is made to deposit 100k BAL to Aave to earn a yield. BAL token holders have the power to allocate BAL held in the treasury, so as long as the other criteria for a “well defined” proposal are met, this would proceed to a vote.

If the Gov Council fails to execute their duties in good faith and votes against a “well defined” proposal proceeding to a vote, a proposal to replace the Gov Council with a different mechanism should be made ASAP.

**Finally, this proposal would also implement a required minimum quorum of 100k BAL. Any snapshot vote that does not reach 100k total BAL voted AND at least 51% voting in favor would be considered to fail.**",bullish,11.89,2022-02-24 12:04:39+00:00,12.52,12.52,2022-02-25 00:00:00+00:00,5.29857022708157,12.35,0.0386879730866274,0.8931588530540466,True," The text discusses a proposal aimed at reforming Balancer's governance process, focusing on the role of the Gov Council and the concept of ""soft consensus in the community."" The author argues that the current system allows for large token holders to potentially bypass community opinion, creating a situation where proposals with significant token holder support may not reach a vote due to lacking ""soft consensus.""

The proposed solution is to remove the requirement for ""soft consensus"" and instead focus on whether a proposal is well-defined. A well-defined proposal would include specific sections, clear intent, and ensure BAL token holders have the power to implement it. The Gov Council will still be required for approval but will no longer vote on community consensus.

Additionally, the proposal introduces a minimum quorum of 100k BAL for any snapshot vote, with both a total of 100k BAL voted and at least 51% in favor being necessary for a successful vote. If the Gov Council fails to act in good faith, a proposal to replace them should be made promptly.",bullish,small
947,1723,4664,4664,4664,2023-01-12 15:01:17+00:00,balancer,"**Summary:**

> This pool uses the metastable pool factory and contains Lido's liquid staking derivative of ethereum, wstETH. The reason for this pool deployment is to replace the composable stable pool implementation of this pairing with a pool which Balancer can continue to collect the fees on properly. Due to the activation of recovery mode, the current pool is being streamed BAL incentives without the DAO being properly compensated for the fees the pool generates. This proposal will effectively activate this new pool’s gauge and kill the current pool’s gauge to foster migration of liquidity to the preferred pool.

> wstETH is Lido’s wrapped staking derivative as featured in many other Balancer pools. WETH is wrapped ETH. 

**Motivation:**

> Described in the summary, the protocol can collect fees on the metastable pool and not the composable stable pool. Moving the incentives will motivate the liquidity providers to migrate their liquidity to the better pool option for Balancer.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** [wstETH](https://research.lido.fi/).
2. **Oracles:** See each rate provider contract linked here [wstETH ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768),
3. **Audits:** See [wstETH](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits).
4. **Centralization vectors:** For Lido and wstETH please read [here ](https://lido.fi/faq).
5. **Market History:** See [wstETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth)
6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on all assets in the pool and so will LPs. The BIP-19 flywheel will incentivize TVL to grow here with trading volume and our staked ethereum pillars will continue to have Balancer as their ideal liquidity destination.

This proposal aims to receive community support for whitelisting Yearn's yBAL locker/voter contract on Ethereum, to lock B-80BAL-20WETH for veBAL.

## Motivation

Yearn is building yBAL, a new veBAL liquid wrapper (based on our successful yCRV product) designed to tokenize the different benefits of Yearn’s veBAL position. This system will be comprised of a base token (yBAL) as well as three “activated” yBAL tokens.

yBAL can be minted by locking B-80BAL-20WETH into Yearn’s veBAL position (a permanent one-way “forever” lock). This operation mints yBAL to the user at a 1:1 rate. yBAL carries no yield itself but allows users to enter or exit the yBAL ecosystem. It will be soft-pegged to B-80BAL-20WETH via a Balancer pool.

Yearn passes the benefits from its veBAL position to the three activated yBAL tokens:

**1. st-yBAL (staking rewards):**
- st-yBAL will be a yVault that holds yBAL and receives yield from…
- 100% of the admin fees from Yearn’s total veBAL position
- Gauge voting bribes (any yBAL inside st-yBAL earns yield by voting for gauges with bribes).
- All profit will be swapped for more yBAL which will be deposited back into the strategy.

**2. lp-yBAL (liquidity pool rewards):**
- lp-yBAL will be a yVault for the B-80BAL-20WETH/yBAL Balancer pool.
- It will earn yield by auto-compounding BAL emissions and trading fees into more B-80BAL-20WETH/yBAL BPTs.

**3. vl-yBAL (gauge voting power):**
- vl-yBAL will be a contract that accepts yBAL and offers holders liquid on-chain veBAL gauge weight voting.
- Broader Balancer DAO/gov votes will not be extended to vl-yBAL holders.
- vl-yBAL holders receive no yield, only 100% of their respective veBAL gauge voting power.

Users can choose to move between activated tokens at any time depending on which benefits they want, except for vl-yBAL which will have time lock restrictions varying from 14 to 28 days.

## Technical implementation:

Yearn's yBAL locker/voter has now been deployed...

We propose adding it to the allowlisted addresses in the SmartWalletChecker (0x7869296Efd0a76872fEE62A058C8fBca5c1c826C) so that we can launch the yBAL ecosystem and begin locking B-80BAL-20WETH for veBAL.",bullish,6.28,2023-03-15 14:15:04+00:00,6.762,6.762,2023-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,7.67515923566877,6.5465,0.042436305732484,0.9184085130691528,True," The text proposes a plan to whitelist Yearn's yBAL locker/voter contract on Ethereum, aiming to lock B-80BAL-20WETH for veBAL.

**Leader(s)**: Jack Purdy, John_TV_Locke, Traver Normandi

**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct (or link to your own)**: Yes

**Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines:** Yes

**Domains of Operation**: Research, Reporting, Data Analytics, Growth

**Overview:**

We are proposing Messari becomes a core Service Provider focused on research and reporting for the DAO, renewing the previous contract for 25% less while expanding it to include more advanced data tooling and governance reporting. This is done through Messari’s Protocol Services, which is separate from Messari Enterprise, the entirety of our work is funded through project grants enabling us to make it all publicly available.

Messari Protocol Services believes in the power and importance of transparency and education in DeFi. Protocols enable permissionless networks, and DAOs manage the parameters and designs of the protocol and related token. Both users and members of the DAO benefit from deep data research and communication. Messari PS hires and trains analysts to become a productive member of DAO communities and experts in the protocols they cover, enabling them to help surface key data and events to the largest distribution of crypto users, investors, and builders available. DeFi, and crypto in general, requires unbiased third parties to work with communities to surface transparent, detailed, and digestible information about the protocol and DAO. Messari PS is the leading provider for that solution.

For an update from our [prior proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-commission-quarterly-financial-reports-through-the-messari-hub/2318), as a company Messari has 3x our headcount with a team of over 150 after raising a Series B led by Brevan Howard Digital. We’ve used that to significantly scale our research, data science, and engineering resources to build out our quarterly reporting and research capabilities. This has enabled us to bring all of our research in-house so we can have dedicated sector-specific analysts assigned to each protocol to cover them each quarter and continue to build up expertise.

We have become core subgraph developers for The Graph and are building out open-source data infrastructure that feeds into our quarterly reports and live data dashboards.

Lastly, we have been working extensively on growing our distribution and have signed deals to redistribute quarterly reports with Bloomberg, S&P Global, and Refinitiv three of the largest tradfi research platforms in the world.

**Proposal Breakdown**:

Quarterly Reporting

We will produce 4 quarterly reports following the same cadence released shortly after the end of the fiscal quarter. These will break down major KPIs and fundamental metrics such as:

* Aggregate stats - protocol revenue, veBAL distribution, BL incentives, operating margins
* Dex metrics - trading volume, liquidity, new pools
* LP metrics - LP fees, annualized yield

We will look at these from both the macro level and on a more granular level from individual pool level data and network deployments. The data will come from the publicly available subgraphs and Dune dashboards we’ve built.

Data Analytics

We’ve already released freely available [data dashboards](https://messari.io/protocol/balancer-v2) showing many of the metrics included in the quarterly reports. We plan to extend this by building an advanced LP analytics page showing:

* Pool rankings based on
  * Liquidity, trading volume, revenue, capital efficiency, revenue/$ of TVL
* Profitability calculator
  * Pool returns split out by swap fees and reward emissions
* Backtesting of different LP positions
* Simulating future returns
* Help user in finding best pools based on their LP profile
  * Shortlist pools to LP on based on LP profile and preferences
  * Track performance of LP positions over time
  * Compare across different deployments and different pools

Governance Analysis

* A Bi-Annual Governance Report
  * Messari will create bi-annual reports to analyze key governance KPIs and metrics and a detailed look into governance structure, process, dynamics, and analysis. (ex: [Optimism](https://messari.io/report/state-of-optimism-governance?referrer=all-research))
  * Details include:
    * Introduction
      * Balancer Structure and Process Updates.
    * Quantitative Analysis
      * veBAL Distribution.
      * Power Dynamics (Voter blocs, whales, voter history, etc.)
      * Proposal Analysis (Proposal history, success rate, participation metrics, categorization, etc.).
    * Qualitative Analysis
      * Governance Design
        * Structure/Process Analysis.
        * Quorum Analysis.
        * Exploration of governance opportunities.
      * Proposal Analysis
        * Highlight of contentious proposals or noteworthy governance events.
    * Conclusion
* Retainer for a Balancer Governor Note
  * A 1500-3000 word proposal-specific analysis designed to educate stakeholders on the impacts of important DAO proposals.

**Key Objectives & Success Metrics**:

1. Surfacing on-chain metrics and protocol developments

Crypto has a glaring lack of sufficient long-form research and analytics. While there are various analytics dashboards, blog posts, and messaging channels to distill information, it is still cumbersome to have a strong understanding of the on-chain activity and important protocol-level developments. This creates a high barrier to making informed decisions as a stakeholder, leading to a misallocation of resources, both time and money, since there are investors, developers, and users that are not acting with the full breadth of knowledge at their disposal.

These services will inform various stakeholders through recurring, data-driven research from trusted, independent analysts. The actionable insights generated from these reports will better educate these stakeholders on the economic, financial, and social health of Balancer.

2. Growth

Not only are we creating these reports but we’re ensuring they get sent out to a wide audience that can consume them. This is done through Messari’s channels of 300,000 crypto-natives, which reach most of the active builders and investors in the industry as well as through our distribution through some of the largest traditional research platforms in the world:

Bloomberg Terminal: 325,000 users

S&P Global Capital IQ: 12,000 enterprises

Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters): 40,000 enterprises and 400,000 users

This goes a long way to further professionalize Balancer to the vast majority of major funds, banks, financial service companies, and large corporations in the world that will better grasp the magnitude of economic activity generated by the protocol. There are trillions of dollars in AUM represented by these platforms so even a small percentage of users consuming this information and acting on it can drive meaningful activity to the protocol.

![bip191_3.png](ipfs://bafkreig4e4umdugw4nvanfwkc2x6fhna3p6yuvxnty6y3ajrtuswmov3g4)
    
    
*A note on success metrics. Given the nature of this proposal, it can be difficult to directly attribute benefits. For example, you can have institutional players consuming reports on Bloomberg and using that as a key part of their diligence to allocate capital however its not possible to say $x of liquidity or investment came in as a result of Messari Research. While we know this is happening anecdotally we can’t tangibly measure it.

**Length of Engagement & Budget**:

edit: We propose the base quarterlies option for the current cycle:

$80k total
  a. 4 Quarterly reports
  b. at least one tweet on each quarterly report
  c. AMA with the DAO on SP calls about quarterly take-aways and inspo for new analysis 
 

Payment can be made in stablecoins or BAL based on market price at time of payment (in which case there will be a 5% premium to account for additional costs of accepting native tokens)

In both cases the funds will go towards:

* Research - Our analysts spend several weeks each report along with an extensive internal editing and review process by the broader team.
* Data Science and Engineering - Each report will have its own dedicated data science and engineering resources tasked with providing all the relevant raw data.
* Distribution - We have several members of the team working on distribution for these reports across all of Messari’s channels along with the third-party partners.

   Summary: This proposal outlines a retainer agreement for a series of in-depth, data-driven research reports on the Balancer protocol, aimed at educating stakeholders and promoting growth. The reports will be distributed through Messari's extensive network and third-party platforms, reaching over 800,000 crypto-natives and financial professionals.

   Key Objectives & Success Metrics:
     1. Surfacing on-chain metrics and protocol developments: By providing comprehensive, long-form research reports, the proposal aims to improve understanding of Balancer's economic, financial, and social health among stakeholders.
     2. Growth: The reports will be distributed through Messari's network and third-party platforms, reaching a wide audience of active builders, investors, and traditional financial institutions.

   Length of Engagement & Budget:
     - Quarterly reports: $80k total for 4 reports, including tweets about each report, an AMA with the DAO, and internal editing and review processes. Payments can be made in stablecoins or BAL based on market price at time of payment. Funds will be allocated to research, data science and engineering, and distribution efforts.

   Qualitative Analysis:
     1. Governance Design: The analysis will include a structure/process analysis, quorum analysis, and exploration of governance opportunities within the Balancer protocol.
     2. Proposal Analysis: Highlighting contentious proposals or noteworthy governance events, the analysis aims to provide insights into important DAO proposals and their potential impacts on the Balancer ecosystem.

   Conclusion: The proposed retainer for a Balancer Governor Note will provide stakeholders with valuable, data-driven research and insights, promoting informed decision-making and growth within the Balancer community. By leveraging Messari's extensive network and distribution capabilities, the proposal aims to reach a wide audience of crypto-natives, investors, and financial professionals.",bullish,small

## Motivation

The Balancer Maxis have worked closely together with Mimic to streamline and automate protocol fee processing on all Balancer deployments. In an initial phase, Mimic used their smart vault v2 architecture to process fees. In a second phase, we migrated Mainnet, Avalanche and Base fee processing to their smart vault v3 architecture as ratified in [[BIP-488]](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x897aba7b7f3a68867595fea782931da3aae10fc15c62d8ace8cbd8e923ac07c4).

Given the success of the fee processing automation program, we propose to further authorize the Mimic smart vault v3 on Arbitrum, Polygon and Gnosis. Permissions of the currently in use smart vault v2 will be revoked once smart vault v3 fee processing is fully operational.

**Summary:**
This proposal enables a Balancer gauge for a plsRDNTv2/8020RDNTWETH LP stable pool on Balancer Arbitrum.

This pool is requested to have a gauge with a 2% weight cap until adoption proves it deserves higher in the gauge system. The plsRDNTv2 yield is autocompounded and tracked via a rate provider which will be used to maintain peg of the stablepool. This will permit plsRDNTv2 lockers to compound their DLP rewards into permalocked DLP, while swapping in and out of the locked position. The pool will be therefore be yield bearing and be designated as a core pool with the core infra 1.75x multiplier for ARB STIP incentives mentioned [here](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/data_automation/blob/main/notebooks/arb_dao_grant_distribution/README.md)

**Protocol Description:**
Plutus is an Arbitrum-native governance aggregator aiming to maximize users’ liquidity and rewards while aggregating governance behind the PLS token. Plutus’ objective is to become the de-facto Layer 2 governance blackhole for projects with veTokens and the home of exotic liquid staking derivatives.

plsRDNTv2 is an index (4626) built on top of the Radiant dLP, a liquid staking derivative of the max-locked dLP token on Radiant.

**Motivation:**
We believe having plsRDNTV2 - 8020RDNTWETH LP on Balancer represents a strong partnership between Plutus, Balancer and Radiant, leading to permanently locked liquidity and governance for Radiant and Balancer as plsRDNTv2 locks the underlying DLP, which lives on Balancer permanently.

This allows us to create a flywheel that will bring value through the following mechanisms:

1. Aura and veBAL holders through bribes

> This pool uses the new weighted pool factory and contains a boosted / linear stable coin wrapper bb-rf-aUSDC - Beets Reaper Aave Boosted USDC. Stargate has been moving liquidity over to Balancer and plans to continue pursuing making Balancer their liquidity hub. STG is a governance token which must be staked to apply to Stargate's governance in a vote escrowed fashion. Stargate focuses on cross-chain / omnibridge solutions. The protocol will be earning yield on the boosted portion of this pool, making the token pairing more efficient for both parties. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. See more information on bribes in the ""Value"" section regarding the  mechanism on Optimism, they are unique compared to the other chains.

**Protocol Description:**

> bb-rf-aUSDC is a boosted form of USDC from Reaper's AAVE strategy. STG is the Stargate governance token. 

**Motivation:**

> The push for layer two dominance continues on Optimism and doing so with a multichain solution team like Stargate makes sense. This pool is will support STG holders in providing a healthy destination for their governance tokens and bb-rf-aUSDC to benefit LPs, traders, and Balancer overall. This tightens the partnership with Stargate while providing optimized liquidity circumstances for all parties. 

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** Find more information about governance on Stargates’s [forum](https://commonwealth.im/stargatetoken/discussions). USDC is centralized and does not have a governance forum. 
2. **Oracles:** This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned.
3. **Audits:** See [here](https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/audits)
4. **Centralization vectors:** USDC is inherently centralized, STG can be justified [here](https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/v/user-docs/governance/governance-model). 
5. **Market History:** See [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stargate-finance).
6. **Value:** We will earn the protocol fee on bb-rf-aUSDC yield. Protocol fees on Optimism were split 50% to Balancer (passively to DAO & veBAL) and 50% to BeethovenX. Until January 100% will be sent to BeethovenX per [BIP-91](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x38bed268fe1536a6c8e9d5d5b3139bfba912b46507e2a72777cac691f58549d0) to stimulate L2 growth. 50% is returned as incentives on Optimism pools either via bribes or direct LM. The other half is split between funding the team and accumulating veBAL/auraBAL/vlAURA per this [recent proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x3d6e0373f0f1c041a82e6108a01aee2e00a21be43667259126b70e5fd2a5f93a). Thus emissions towards this gauge serve to help our flywheel accelerate our growth on Optimism and maintain a foothold for the long term.

Hello Balancer Community!

Historically Orb has included the cost of our ONsites into its funding requests. We’ve decided to change that and request a separate, standalone proposal for these events starting with the one we are hoping to have in Q4 of this year. I know it might seem super early to start planning for this, but fear not, we are right on time. We need to get started on location selection because hotel blocks for groups of our size fill up many months in advance.

We are requesting 93,750 USDC to pay for 25 attendees:

* Maxis: 7
* Beethoven: 3
* Integrations (Orbies): 3
* Grants: 1
* Foundation: 2
* OpCo: 5
* Other Ecosystem Contributors: 4

Balancer Labs will pay for the costs of its attendees.

As a reminder, the goals of our ecosystem ONsites are to facilitate 1) in-person brainstorms and collaboration meetings and 2) team bonding. We have found the optimal cadence for in-person gatherings to be twice per year. Gathering the ecosystem together in person to discuss, debate and learn from things that went well and didn’t go well over the last six months has proven to be super valuable.

The agenda for each ONsite includes a Retrospective Meeting to review the last 6 months of work across the ecosystem), a Funding Meeting to plan the roadmap of projects that the ecosystem will work on in the next 6 months, and meetings that are reflective on what’s timely at the time of the event (ie, KPIs, marketing, regulatory, technical vision, mission/vision/values). Having the space and time to hold these meetings in person has been significantly more impactful for our team than having them virtually. In-person meetings allow more fluid conversations and attendees are more likely to build positive relationships through them. Contributors are also able to collaboratively brainstorm easier in person rather than virtually.

Here is some feedback that we received in our follow-up survey after our Q4 2022 ONsite:

* “ONsites are a must for remote-first companies.” - BLabs contributor
* “Getting to know everyone personally [was my favorite part]. It created an even better feeling when doing video calls now.” - BLabs contributor
* “Being able to meet the smart contracts team and ask them some questions [was my favorite part].” - OpCo contributor
* “The organization was great overall and I’ve really enjoyed the experience and getting to know my co-contributors in person :)” - BLabs contributor
* “We were reasonably frugal.” - BLabs contributor
* “It was an amazing experience.” - Orb contributor
* “I found that just a sole opportunity to meet the team and exchange ideas was very valuable.” - BLabs contributor

We are asking for funding based on our best estimate of what the total ecosystem headcount will be in Q4. If we have more attendees than what we budgeted for, we will need to request additional funding. If we have less, we will return excess funds to the OpCo. It’s worth noting that if that additional funding is not approved we won’t be able to invite new ecosystem members to this ONsite.

We are estimating that each attendee will cost 3,750 USDC for our five day/four night event. Breakdown of this cost:

* Travel (Flights/Airport Transfers): 1,229 USDC/person
* Overnight Accommodations: 928 USDC/person
* Meeting Room Rentals: 82 USDC/person
* Meals: 594 USDC/person
* Activities: 332 USDC/person
* Misc Expenses (ie, covid tests, meeting supplies, etc): 27 USDC/person
* Canvas Meetings organizer fee: 399 USDC/person
  * Includes sourcing, contracting, pre-planning, budget management, food & beverage management, vendor and all event logistics management.
* ONsite event coordinator: 159 USDC/person
  * Includes 24/7 dedication to our group ensuring everything goes smoothly from start to finish of the event. They monitor and assist with incoming and outgoing travel and make sure that all meetings, meals and activities are set up correctly and go on without a hitch.

When planning these events we are always looking for ways to achieve our goals with a cost conscious lens on. Examples of this are not covering costs for flight upgrades and a mix of per diem meals and shared meals versus all shared meals. The Q4 event will be no different. For any funds that aren’t used for this event, we will keep those in our ONsite account and apply it to the next one.

Edit:

This a capped budget and funds will flow directly through OpCo and OpCo’s wallet. Unused funds can be returned to Treasury. With Orb sunsetting, organization will be handled by Maxis together with OpCo for logistics and BLabs for their own contributors.

If approved, DAO Treasury 0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f will transfer 93,750 USD to OpCo's wallet 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693 to cover ONsite expenses

955,1736,4712,4712,4712,2022-05-23 10:57:37+00:00,balancer,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-pickle-finance-in-vebal-s-votingescrow/3182)


## Vision

[Pickle Finance][2] aims to become the home for Balancer LPs to enjoy the best possible returns and to become a major collaborator in the governance of the Balancer Protocol. 

## Abstract

Pickle is building a module on top of Balancer's Gauge system that seeks to aid Balancer LPs and prospective `veBAL` participants in maximising the utility of their deposits with Balancer, while also enhancing the overall utility of the Balancer's Gauge system by creating a liquid `veBAL` derivative.

Similar to other ""boosting protocols"", Pickle aims to create these synergies by providing an easy mechanism for the aggregation of `veBAL` boosts and for prospective Balancer LPs to benefit from this boost.

The Pickle and Balancer teams are no strangers to each other, with Pickle being invited and expressing its willingness to join the Balancer Wars as early as the Gauge system was announced. Pickle has borrowed from its unique experience running a Gauge system for itself and building on top of other boosting modules like Convex to come up with a unique system we call the Brinery. 

As a gesture of goodwill and to encourage the creation and adoption of the Balancer Brinery, Pickle will be providing incentives (in `$PICKLE` tokens) to both those who vote to whitelist us and those who join the Brinery early on. These incentives will be detailed pending their approval by Pickle governance. The Balancer community can expect the Pickle Core team to propose between 2-3% of the `PICKLE` supply to be awarded to Balancer Brinery incentives, with rougly 80% of these reserved for joiners and 20% for voters.

This proposal makes no request to the Balancer community for financial assistance to Pickle. We are a solvent, revenue-generating protocol with a healthy balance sheet. Our interest is in providing a superior service to Balancer users and to create a symbiotic relationship between our communities.

## Brinery Specification: Architecture & Design

The Brinery will provide a seamless experience for users to join `veBAL`. Our proposed system works in the following manner: 
1. Users deposit 80/20 BAL/ETH `BPT` with Pickle
2. Users receive **brinBAL** in return
3. Under the hood, Pickle will:
  a) Lock up a portion of `BAL/ETH` for `veBAL` in perpetuity - a receipt token is issued for the locked amount as **pveBAL**. A portion of `BAL/ETH` liquidity is retained
  b) Supply `pveBAL` and retained `BAL/ETH` into a new Balancer pool
4. Users can redeem `brinBAL` for their proportionate share of `pveBAL` and `BAL/ETH` (or in a single asset if they wish)

This design has the advantage of guaranteeing liquidity for Pickle's `veBAL` derivative. The Brinery contracts will have flexibility in managing liquidity to achieve the proper balance between liquidity and maximal rewards. Users who hold `brinBAL` will receive Balancer governance rewards (all fee-sharing rewards, emissions, and bribe proceeds will be consolidated into BAL tokens), the Brinery's ""flywheel"" rewards (`BAL` ""taxed"" from Brinery boosted PickleJars), and of course `PICKLE` tokens. 

For users familiar with our standard PickleJar, a series of Brinery Boosted Jars, or ""brinJars"", will be on offer to compound users' BPT positions, taking advantage of boosted rewards from the Brinery's `veBAL` lock, alongside `PICKLE` incentives. These novel Balancer Jars will rely on state-of-the-art infrastructure and comply with the EIP-4626 standard for maximal efficiency, security, and composability. 

## Pickle

### History

Pickle is one of the original yield aggregators in DeFi, bringing innovations such as incentivised auto-farming with its PickleJars. We have been building as an Ethereum-based DAO since September 2020. Our builders are well-known and have collaborated over their time in DeFi with many top-notch protocols and teams to build, conduct security reviews, or brainstorm and validate ideas. To name a few: Yearn, Sushi, Curve, Polygon, Frax, Alchemix, and of course, Balancer.

Pickle has crossed paths with Balancer on several occasions. Pickle was the first yield aggregator to build on top of Balancer on its launch in Polygon. Moreover, our `PICKLE-ETH` was only the second pool after `BAL-ETH` to launch with Balancer on Arbitrum. A cursory look at the [BAL mining scripts on GitHub][1] shows we are 1 of 11 Balancer partners. On Arbitrum, we are 1 of 3. We are brethren in DeFi and hope to remain so for many years to come.

Finally, Pickle was the first-ever protocol to adapt Curve's Gauge system to align its users and token holders into a better governance system we call `DILL`. More than 51% of all `PICKLE` is currently locked for an average of 3.23 years, with almost 1,000 `DILL` holders forming the DAO that backs our protocol.

### Team

Pickle is led by myself, joined by the rest of the core team which currently consists of another 12 individuals with a wide range of skills in product, product marketing, UX design, smart contracts engineering, and frontend and Web3 infrastructure development. 

### Governance

Pickle is run according to the principle of ""progressive decentralisation"" by the DILL DAO. DILL governance is currently upgrading so DILL holders receive 100% of protocol revenues generated by Pickle, in ETH, plus PICKLE anti-dilutive rewards. At present, using Pickle's Gauge system, DILL holders can vote on-chain for where PICKLE emissions should go. With support for delegation currently in development, Pickle aims to launch its own ""Pickle voting module"" so users can participate in governance, including PICKLE emission allocations across sidechains, via secure offchain voting.

The Pickle voting module to provide DILL holders an interface for directing `veBAL` voting power held by Pickle's Balancer Brinery, as well as select the allocation of PICKLE emissions amongst our various Brinery products. 

## Specification

If this vote passes, the Balancer DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction with `0x7869296Efd0a76872fEE62A058C8fBca5c1c826C` calling the function `allowlistAddress` with the argument `0x93318d4b44558f57B688C6943fA9E2c3e52540B0`

 The Balancer Maxis are a passionate group of Balancer community contributors. A center of excellence that keeps the Balancer ecosystem operating at a first class level. As the protocol grows, this team's responsibilities will likely grow with it. We have picked up maintenance tasks from other organizations in the Balancer ecosystem as it continues to decentralize and would expect this to continue (see examples below).

### Leader(s)

Solarcurve - joined by Zekraken, Mike B, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, and Danko8383.

**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct (or link to your own)**: Yes

**Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines:** Yes

### Domains of Operation

*Multisig Management*

* Linear (boosted) pool settings
* Swap fee and amplification adjustments
* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL
* Adding new reward tokens to gauges
* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees
* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig

**Expertise:** Besides setting swap fees, this group has done all these tasks from day 1. Soon after we took control of swap fees from our friends at Gauntlet, the protocol broke the previous record of 24h fees earned. We believe our track record justifies our continued management of these multisigs until such time as governance approves another SP to take them over.

*Governance*

* We serve on the [Governance Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-governance-process-revamp/2324) and ensure continuity of Balancer’s Governance Process
* Active participants in discord and the forum on governance topics
* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)
* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process
* Manage admin of the Governance forum
* We will pursue various strategic initiatives, either individually or as a group, at our discretion such as deploying to Optimism or the new Operating Framework
* In the cases that voting power in other protocols from tokens held in Balancer’s Treasury has been delegated to us, we will represent Balancer’s interest in these votes.

**Expertise:** We helped to design Balancer’s governance system and are very active users of it. It is safe to say our group has the strongest working knowledge of Balancer’s governance system outside of Balancer Labs. For now it does require active management to ensure votes are carried out in an orderly fashion then properly executed. We believe our track record here again speaks for itself and we will continue to operate in the same fashion we have been until governance approves a new governance framework or approves another SP to take these tasks over.

*User/project support*

* We manage Balancer’s discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed
* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions
* We often deploy new pools for other projects
* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists
* We help with UI testing for Balancer

**Expertise:** If you come to discord we’ll likely be the ones helping you out. We are also spread out in many chats with projects offering advice and performing routine necessary tasks as described above. It is safe to say almost all projects that have used Balancer over the last year have spoken to one of us at some point. We will continue to operate in this support capacity and offer any assistance we can to the community and the efforts of other SP’s.

*Community*

* We manage a Coordinape circle open to all DAO contributors
* Onboarding framework for new contributors
* Offboarding for contributors transitioning from the DAO, or between SPs
* Regular health-check on SP and community contributors with recurrent feedback

**Expertise:** These initiatives were pioneered by some of our members over the last six months. We will continue iterating and exploring these both with our in house knowledge but also in collaboration with the broader community.

*Record Keeping*

* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.
* Maintaining, updating, and improving official Balancer documentation as a bridge between the greater community and core development team.

### Key Objectives & Success Metrics

*Multisig Management*

* Transactions are vetted for accuracy and executed in a timely manner
* Public discord channels are used for swap fee discussion so the community can provide input and feedback.

*Governance*

* Balancer’s Governance system continues to operate in a fair and transparent manner.
* We will continue being very active participants and leaders

*User/project support*

* Discord/telegram chat questions will be answered in a timely manner

*Community*

* Coordinape will pay out promptly each month
* We will act as a touch point for any interested contributors to Balancer DAO

*Global*

* We commit to undertake all activities in public where reasonable. We aim to responsibly grow the Balancer Maxis and this can only be done when the community is able to interact and engage with us. There must be more opportunities for this in the future.
* We will continue to facilitate the weekly Treasury meeting (Tuesday 11am EST in discord) open to the public. This is a good opportunity for anyone in the community to talk to us about the Treasury or any other relevant topic.
* We will facilitate a monthly community call where all SP’s are welcome to join for their monthly updates. This eases the burden on the community to attend many calls. Again, optional participation by other SP’s.

### Length of Engagement & Budget:

3 months.

Budget of 6,875 BAL per month for salaries (1,250 per person, Danko at 625) which will be max locked in veBAL by contributors. Additional monthly allocations of 100 BAL for gas costs and 4,000 BAL for Coordinape.

**Total for 3 month engagement:** 32,925 BAL

**Impact on the Treasury**: The Treasury currently holds ~4M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis would cost less than 1% of the treasury’s BAL holdings.

**ETH Address to Receive Funds**: 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325

**Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation):** N/A

**Introduction**
Whitelist the Aave Companies’ Gnosis Safe multisig, to vote-lock the B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the Aave Companies’ treasury into veBAL and participate in governance for the Balancer DAO.

**Motivation**
The Aave Companies are software developers who build open source, blockchain based software, including the Aave Protocol – an open source, decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users to supply and borrow crypto assets.

The Aave Companies have been a long-term user of the Balancer AMM, and currently hold the equivalent of ~252k BAL. This BAL was acquired through early investments and as rewards in exchange for participation in BAL boosted LPs. 

Given this support, the Aave Companies would like to engage in Balancer DAO governance through veBAL. 

**Risks**
The Aave Companies recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

**Specification**

This proposal has been developed by the Balancer Foundation Working Group (LuukDAO#5294, Mog#1336, Mkflow#7938, Xeonus#4620, Solarcurve#5075)

**SUMMARY**

Over the last few months, a group of active community members has been evaluating the potential of establishing a Balancer Foundation. After studying ENS, dYdX, PrimeDAO and others we propose the incorporation of the Balancer Foundation. The Balancer Foundation will provide the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work, furthering Balancer’s decentralization goals, and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.

**MOTIVATION**

We believe the formation of the Balancer Foundation is key to furthering the vision of decentralization and creating a robust environment where many groups of people can participate.

Establishing a real world entity that is directed by the DAO provides two primary benefits:

1. It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts – for example, it could establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto.

2. It encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, it could engage marketing providers or website creators.

**SPECIFICATION**

This proposal is created to recognize the need for a foundation and acknowledge there will be future proposals for funding this Foundation. The Balancer Foundation will act as an ‘Agent of the DAO’. The Balancer Foundation will be a Cayman Island entity.

**Benefits**

Establishing a Balancer Foundation will directly benefit the DAO by acting as a mechanism for the DAO to:

* direct service providers for major undertakings needed by the DAO
* build resiliency within the DAO and across the broader Balancer Ecosystem
* interact with meatspace engagements as necessary (eg paying subscriptions)

**Foundation Composition**

The Balancer Foundation will be composed of a Board and a CEO for day-to-day operations. The board will be headed by a Supervisor of the Board and board members will be established representatives of the Balancer Ecosystem. The CEO and the Supervisor of the Board are to be located in Cayman.

The following people are proposed to hold these roles:

* [Tristan Relly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-relly-ca-sa-b7a2941/?trk=people-guest_people_search-card): CEO & only staff member
* [Sean Inggs](https://www.ims.ky/our-team): Supervisor of the Board
* Mkflow#7938: Representative of the Balancer DAO, current baller
* Xeonus#4620: Representative of the Balancer DAO, current baller

**ECOSYSTEM FOUNDATION EXAMPLES**

Foundation examples already exist across multiple projects and protocols within the crypto landscape.

Some examples include:

* *dYdX Foundation* - “purpose is to support and grow every aspect, technical or otherwise, of the current implementation and all future implementations of the dYdX Layer 2 Protocol”. Further explanation of the Foundation’s mission can be found [here](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/resources/dydx-foundation).
* *ENS Foundation** - is used as a tool by the DAO to have real-world representation. Description of why ENS thinks this is useful, how the foundation is structured, and what powers the DAO has over the Foundation can be read [here.](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/the-ens-foundation)

***IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE***

* January 2022 - The Balancer Foundation Working Group, composed of LuukDAO#5294, Mog#1336, Mkflow#7938, Xeonus#4620, Solarcurve#5075 has been established to develop this proposal, to review the Articles of Incorporation, and to ensure that the Balancer Foundation is considered and leveraged where appropriate as a mechanism for the DAO. Some examples include reviewing service provider agreements, establishing bookkeeping processes, and completing token diversification agreements when needed.

* April 2022 - Legal incorporation of Balancer Foundation
  * Final approval of the Foundation’s Articles of Incorporation is expected in 1-2 days & will be provided as an attachment on this forum post.

* Q2 2022 - Funding request proposal which defines the budget and operation of the Foundation.

**VOTING**

This proposal will be posted on the forum for a minimum of 5 days prior to voting. Voting will then be open on Snapshot for three days. This vote will be a single-choice vote. You may vote on the Proposal by selecting “Yes, let's do it” or “No, this is not the way”.

Voting “Yes, let's do it” on this proposal means:

* You recognize a foundation is needed & acknowledge there will be future proposals for funding.
  * Note that this proposal is not requesting funding.
  * This proposal is acknowledging the need for a Foundation and acknowledges that future proposals will be made for funding.",bullish,15.25,2022-04-21 15:04:14+00:00,16.07,16.07,2022-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,5.3770491803278695,14.85,-0.0262295081967212,0.8938709199428558,True," The text discusses a proposal to establish the Balancer Foundation, developed by a group of active community members.

# Summary:

Enable a Balancer gauge for the wFRK/PAR/jEUR (p-cs-kp-eur) pool with a 2% cap on Polygon

wFRK is an erc-4626 wrapper of FRK. FRK is a freely transferable Interest Bearing token backed by French T-bills offering approximately 3,38% APR. The KUMA Protocol accepts to swap regulated NFTs (KUMA NFTs) backed by bonds in exchange of composable interest-bearing tokens (KIBT) based on the metadata of the NFT.

PAR is crypto-backed Euro stablecoin issued by the Parallel Protocol.

jEUR is crypto-backed Euro stablecoin issued by the Jarvis Protocol.

# Protocol Description:

## KUMA Protocol

The KUMA Protocol results from the work of two distinct organizations: Mimo Capital AG and the KUMA Protocol.

* Mimo Capital AG, a Liechtenstein regulated and licensed company, audited by [Grant Thornton](https://www.grantthornton.global/en/) issues tokens backed by bonds (KUMA NFTs) using NFT technology (underlying bonds are held by [Bank Frick & Co. AG](https://www.bankfrick.li/en)) to authorized individuals/companies (KYC/KYB).

* The KUMA Protocol is a decentralized entity governed by vMIMO token holders that leverages these NFTs and issues KUMA interest-bearing tokens (KIBTs), which are freely transferable erc-20 tokens. These interest-bearing tokens behave similarly to stablecoins whose balance increases automatically.

Currently, 3 KIBTs are deployed on Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Mantle & Linea:

* FRK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFT, themselves backed by 360 days French T-Bills. (± 3,38% APR)
* USK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFTs, themselves backed by US 12 months T-Bills. (± 4,5% APR)
* EGK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFT, themselves backed by 740 days Next.e.GO Mobile SE Corporate Bonds. (± 8,75% APR)

### Parallel Protocol

The Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol) is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon and Fantom. Stablecoins (PAR & paUSD) are decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro/USD fiat currency.

### Jarvis Network

Jarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks.

The Synthereum protocol has four modules:

* Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed.
* Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types.
* Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio.
* Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools.

Most jFIATs have a direct fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi) or indirect (Monerium, Paytrie, Transfero etc.), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Aave, 0VIX), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy).

# Motivation:

The role of the p-cs-kp-eur pool is to increase the stability of PAR and wFRK (1), the on-chain liquidity of both PAR and wFRK (2), connect the Parallel and KUMA ecosystems (3) and providing a fiat gateway to PAR & wFRK holders on Polygon PoS (4). Together, these 4 points allow for building a Bonds DeFi ecosystem.

1. PAR & wFRK peg:

* PAR is issued following the CDP model; if PAR trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy PAR cheaper and repay their debt; if PAR trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow PAR and sell them at a higher price; since wFRK can be exchanged for Bonds NFT, and can be sold for real EURO, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and EURO market to help maintain the PAR peg; so if PAR trades below or above its peg, anyone can perform an arbitrage without having to go through a CDP.
* wFRK is an erc-4626 wrapper of FRK. FRK is issued by using the “swap” function on the KUMA Protocol, each FRK are backed by Treasury Bonds NFT, if the peg is below the real price, KYC/KYB people are incentivized to buy FRK and redeem the NFT, if the price is above the peg, NFT holders are incentivized to mint FRK and sell them.

2. On-chain liquidity:

* wFRK: Since PAR can be exchanged for jEUR and wFRK which are redeemable for EUR. Users can swap PAR for wFRK and/or jEUR then EUR by buying/selling KUMA NFTs and/or redeem jEUR for EUR to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa.
* PAR: since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC, EURe and ETH without price impact, then exchanging jEUR, ETH or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap PAR to jEUR and then to USDC or ETH to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa. This considerably increases PAR liquidity.
* jEUR: jEUR main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jEUR minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers, which is vital to us; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets).

3. Connect ecosystems:
The p-cs-kp-eur (wFRK, PAR, jEUR) pool connects Parallel and its PAR (essentially a way to borrow EURO with various collateral) to KUMA and its wFRK (providing onchain FR T-bills), but also Jarvis and jEUR, enabling multiple use cases:

* Credit without FX risk: borrow PAR, swap for jEUR then off-ramp jEUR (Monerium, Mt Pelerin, etc.).
* Leverage short on EUR/XXX: borrow PAR, swap for jEUR, redeem for ETH or USDC, and repeat.
* DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: jEUR has an indirect 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium, and a direct fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium. This pool can help users to buy PAR with Euros or to sell PAR for Euros.

### A few notes:

* PAR & jEUR already have a gauge on Polygon: [2eur (PAR)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x513cdee00251f39de280d9e5f771a6eafebcc88e000000000000000000000a6b)
* Parallel & KUMA Protocols already have a gauge on their wUSK/paUSD/USDC pool on Ethereum: [wUSK/paUSD/USDC](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x01536b22ea06e4a315e3daaf05a12683ed4dc14c0000000000000000000005fc)
* Jarvis LTD has started building positions in BAL, TETU and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same positions.
* Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools for vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL etc. (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot).
* Mimo Labs has started building positions in AURA (310k $vlAURA & 53k $AURA) & BAL and the Parallel Protocol treasury currently holds 20k $vlAURA.
* Mimo Labs is currently buying ±$200k AURA which will be locked to incentivize the liquidity.
* The Parallel DAO will also pay ±$225$ voting incentives per week for the pool using the Paladin Quest vote marketplace to the pool (more details [here 1](https://gov.mimo.capital/t/mgp-14-adjust-mimo-tokens-incentives-repartition-on-ethereum-polygon-pos/292))

**Summary:**
THX Network is updating its tokenomics to a voted escrow model with the launch of $veTHX. For this, we’re working with the [8020 Launchpad Initiative](https://www.ve8020.xyz/) funded by [Balancer Grants](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/7d33d4a52c604b719958ab7ff8f1389e?v=2975616ba49e4dd88550c817e23505f9&p=cc4d3268889d419aa76a447be3cb22dc±=c). An [early preview of the $THX staking interface](https://gov.thx.network/t/staking-feedback/70) is available for feedback.

We kindly ask to re-approve the THX/USDC gauge on the 80/20 pool. This pool's staked BPT tokens will form the basis for $veTHX, the new governance token for THX DAO, and also will be the main source of $THX liquidity.

Ps. While with the introduction of BIP-19 the THX DAO created a 50/50 THX/stMATIC ‘core pool’ to align with the Balancer’s long term goals, the tokenomics transition to the voted escrow model makes the 50/50 pool obsolete.

Users don’t have to go to a third party platform! $THX is the protocol's governance token and it’s active on both Polygon and Ethereum mainnet.

The project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under agreement No 82888 (Blockpool) and No 824509 (Block.IS). And is part of the Techstars + ABN AMRO Future of Finance Amsterdam 2022 cohort.

**Motivation:**

* Staked tokens from the 80/20 THX/USDC pool will become the new governance token for THX Network ([UI preview](https://gov.thx.network/t/staking-feedback/70))
* THX Network is working with Protofire.io (funded by a Balancer grant) as a launching user of the ve Launchpad
* The 80/20 THX/USDC pool is the primary source of $THX liquidity, created after the first Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) launch using Copper on Polygon working closely with Alchemist and Copper team members at the time (dec. 2021)
* The 80/20 pool has had up to 0.3% of the vote
* The 50/50 THX/stMATIC pool was established so that it aligns with the BIP19 initiative and can have the ‘core pool’ status, see forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-102-enable-the-thx-stmatic-gauge-on-polygon-with-2-cap/3892

**THX Network DAO and $BAL**
THX DAO has acquired $BAL and has its multisig address (0x4a30c80A2c41312ce4ee79f730C8D84cAD9f7B31) whitelisted for governance.

**Specifications:**
1. **Governance**: DAO multisig 3 out of 4 with two being controlled by core team members employed by THX Network BV (limited company, established 2021, The Netherlands) and two from external community members:
*matic:0x14d4D5CA3Cc67879168dEC88aB018975B24E214b

eth:0xe1E94562014da0CE71C72683eDcEE9D98936B533*
The multisig addresses control the $THX token allocations and the Treasury liquidity. 

2. **Oracles**: no external oracles are used.

3. **Audits**: docs[.]thx.network/other/audits

4. **Centralization vectors**:
Our Campaign Contracts used by customers utilizing our campaign software can at the moment only be controlled by our OpenZeppelin Relay account in order to cover gas costs and offer a frictionless UX for campaign participants.
Context and mitigation:
We are migrating these contracts towards a Safe based architecture where, similar to our current (Safe based) self-custodial wallet architecture, a Web3Auth MPC key will be used to register the account as a signer on the Safe. Next to that we register our OpenZeppelin Relay account as a signer which will be responsible for both transaction initiation sign-in and execution.

5. **Market History**: the $THX token launched at $0.12 and currently sits at $0.04. The pool has been active since dec. 2021 and generated $2.9M in volume since then. It has about $500k in TVL.

6. **Value**: The 80/20 THX/USDC pool is the primary source of $THX liquidity. The pool used to rank number #10 by TVL and fees collected on Polygon.
Since the inception of the 50/50 pool the 80/20 pool has become less central to our ecosystem. However, going forward with the routing of all liquidity incentives, protocol fees and governance power through the 80/20 pool we expect it to significantly grow in TVL, volume and fees.

For reference, here’s the [current overview of our governance process.](https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/governance/governance-process)

In an effort to further decentralize, Balancer Labs is stepping away from the process and handing it over to the community. There’s three elements to the handoff:

1. Moving snapshot admin to a community representative

2. Ceding control of the snapshot ENS

3. Passing the burden of determining when soft consensus has been reached

I will present my suggestions for how the community moves forward on this. My goal is to start a dialogue so please do not hesitate to question anything and everything or offer up alternative ideas.

1. I have experience managing snapshot admin, so I humbly put myself forward as a volunteer to take the admin. I will remove the existing addresses capable of putting a proposal to snapshot and replace them with the addresses of the five full time Ballers - me, bakamoto, andrea, xeonus, and Mike B.

2. I suggest setting the governance multisig as controller of the ENS. The only function they will perform is changing the admin, which should not happen often if ever. This multisig contains many high profile and trusted names in the ethereum community and is the safest place to put the ENS in my opinion.

3. I propose creating a “gov council” of the five full time Ballers mentioned above. A majority vote in favor would be required before a proposal can be posted to snapshot. I can create a discord channel that is public read-only where the five of us will discuss if a proposal has reached soft consensus. It is extremely important to understand that it is not a question of if any of the five personally are in favor of a proposal, but that the community has reached a soft consensus to proceed. For example, if I personally oppose something but it is clear from forum discussion that most people are in favor, I would be obligated to vote in favor of the proposal going to snapshot.

Additionally, I suggest adding a requirement that each proposal include a forum poll as another signaling device we can use. It is gameable of course, but still a valuable input to have I think.

For a snapshot proposal to be considered valid & binding, it must be open for voting for at least three full days and announcements of the vote must be posted to the official @BalancerLabs Twitter account AND in the #announcements channel of Balancer’s discord. These announcements must be made with no less than 24 hours remaining in the vote.",bullish,19.41,2021-11-18 19:12:06+00:00,20.83,20.83,2021-11-19 00:00:00+00:00,7.3158165893869,21.33,0.0989180834621328,0.8822655379772186,True," The text discusses a proposal for decentralizing Balancer's governance process by transferring control to the community. Key elements include:

1. Transferring snapshot admin to a community representative.
2. Giving control of the snapshot ENS to a governance multisig.
3. Establishing a ""gov council"" of five full-time Balancer team members who will determine if soft consensus has been reached before a proposal can be posted to snapshot.
4. Adding a requirement for each proposal to include a forum poll as an additional signaling device.

963,1747,4753,4753,4753,2022-11-17 17:12:28+00:00,balancer,"### Introduction

Aura was originally setup to allow each vlAURA to vote with its underlying share of veBAL.  This required Aura voters to go to the Balancer Snapshot Space and vote.  It also required separate delegation.   The result was that much of the veBAL locked in auraBAL did not vote each round.  Aura has recently passed an AIP to change how they handle veBAL voting, such that the AURA multisig will vote on snapshot with the veBAL in auraBAL following a snapshot vote of token holders.  The governance can be found here:

[https://snapshot.org/#/aurafinance.eth/proposal/0xe794b24a8c75914b29d9a09d61a549c33b0b50a95244b2d2bce4f8f425ee2d2e](https://snapshot.org/#/aurafinance.eth/proposal/0xe794b24a8c75914b29d9a09d61a549c33b0b50a95244b2d2bce4f8f425ee2d2e)

This BIP proposes that balancer stop counting vlAURA as part of Balancer governance.  Otherwise, Aura votes will be counted twice.  Once if/when users vote of Balancer Snapshots, and once when the Aura multisig votes with all of veBAL.

### Specification

- Change the Balancer Snapshot Voting to no longer include the **aura-balance-of-vlaura-vebal** strategy.
- Update the quorum on future votes to be 3 million veBAL.
- Extend all Balancer Snapshot votes by an additional 48 hours (120 hours in total) to provide AURA additional time to run a meta-snapshot.  This will also ensure that balancer governance ends during the week in all timezones.
-- Future snapshots will therefore start on Thursdays and end on Tuesdays.


### Timing

AURA is ready to move forward with this new process. Given that it would be unfair for Aura to vote twice with their system owned veBAL, this BIP proposes to run an immediate vote to make a change to the snapshot space before any other votes are performed.

They will make the specified change for all other Balancer snapshot votes from now going forward. The Balancer Snapshot voting strategy should be changed before this, or vlAURA lockers will be able to vote on the balancer snapshot while auraBAL itself is also voting.  This creates the possibility of votes being double counted.",bullish,5.472,2022-11-17 17:12:28+00:00,5.763,5.763,2022-11-18 00:00:00+00:00,5.31798245614034,5.557,0.0155336257309941,0.8071101009845734,True," The text discusses changes in the governance structure of Aura Finance, specifically regarding veBAL voting and Balancer Snapshot Space. The proposed changes aim to prevent double-voting by removing vlAURA from Balancer governance and adjusting quorum requirements for future votes. Additionally, snapshot votes will be extended and scheduled on Thursdays to Tuesdays going forward. The changes are set to take effect immediately to avoid potential double counting of votes.",bullish,small

### Summary

DAOhaus proposes to add a veBAL guage for the [HAUS/WETH 80/20 pool] `https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x17ddd9646a69c9445cd8a9f921d4cd93bf50d108000200000000000000000159)`

____
### Protocol Description

[$HAUS]`https://daohaus.club/token` is the governance token for DAOhaus.

DAOhaus is a home for purpose-driven community DAOs. The DAOhaus platform is a human-friendly interface for communities to collectively deploy and manage [Moloch DAOs] `https:// medium.com/raid-guild/moloch-evolved-v2-primer-25c9cdeab455` Over 2,000 DAOs have been summoned on the DAOhaus platform to date, with over 10,000 individual DAO members and millions of dollars worth of crypto assets secured in DAO treasuries.

#### Governance: UberHaus and Warcamp

DAOhaus is governed by [UberHaus]`https://uberhaus.club/`, a DAO whose members are themselves DAOs that use the DAOhaus platform. UberHaus’ powers include governing the non-circulating $HAUS supply.

Uberhaus delegates (appointed by each DAO according to their own processes) meet weekly to discuss Uberhaus business. Proposals are made with a 4 day voting period and a 14 day ""grace period"" during which member DAOs can exercise their right to  ""ragequit"", i.e., exit the DAO with their full share of the treasury. This credible threat of exit creates a robust balance of power within the DAO and incentivizes seeking consensus whenever possible.

UberHaus funds one of its member DAOs – Warcamp – to build, maintain, and promote the DAOhaus platform. All core contributors to DAOhaus are members of, and receive compensation from, the Warcamp DAO. Warcamp members are admins of the DAOhaus Github repos.

* The [Warcamp DAO]`https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xef3d8c4fbb1860fceab16595db7e650cd5ad51c1` (on Gnosis Chain)
* The [UberHaus delegate multisig]`https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x648DfEBbaf3638cDa047141dbF4AF3006e880f49` (on Ethereum; 6 of 11), via which a set of delegates from UberHaus and Warcamp manage UberHaus’ assets on Ethereum. Those assets include a portion of the HAUS/WETH Balancer pool liquidity.

#### $HAUS Price History

The majority of the $HAUS price history is viewable [on Coingecko]`https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/daohaus`.

March 29, 2021, was the first time there was publicly available $HAUS liquidity. The initial price at that point was $8.88. There was an immediate runup just prior to Coingecko beginning to track the price.
___
### Motivation

The [HAUS/WETH 80/20 pool]`https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x17ddd9646a69c9445cd8a9f921d4cd93bf50d108000200000000000000000159` needs incentivization to help maintain and deepen its liquidity, which would have a number of important benefits, including the following.

* Enabling easier access to $HAUS for DAOs and individuals wishing to participate in DAOhaus governance activities
* Facilitating DAOhaus ecosystem grants denominated in $HAUS (by increasing the relative stability of the $HAUS price)
* Facilitating upcoming utilization of $HAUS as a coordination mechanism (beyond voting) within the DAOhaus ecosystem (also related to price stability)
* Supporting the utility and value of DAOhaus contributor compensation denominated in $HAUS
____
### Specifications

#### Governance:

See Governance section under Protocol Description above.

#### Oracles:

The DAOhaus platform does not rely on any external oracles.

#### Audits:

The most used smart contracts in the DAOhaus platform are instances of the [MolochV2.1 contract framework]`https://github.com/HausDAO/Molochv2.1`. V2.1 makes only a small adjustment to the [V2 contract]`https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch`, which was audited by Consenys Diligence.

None of the contracts used within the DAOhaus platform are upgradable.

DAOhaus also makes use of Minion contracts, which allow a DAO to interact with external contracts and control external vaults. The predominant version is the [Safe Minion contract]`https://github.com/HausDAO/MinionSummonerV2`, which acts as middleware between the DAO contract and a Gnosis Safe, where all the funds are stored and external contract interactions are executed.

There have been no hacks of DAOhaus smart contracts to date.

* [MolochV2 audit report]`https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/01/the-lao/` by Consensys Diligence

#### Centralization vectors:

DAOhaus takes decentralization seriously and has made several organizational design choices to avoid concentrating power. As a result, the current state of DAOhaus is reasonably decentralized:

* None of the DAOhaus contracts are upgradable.
* Governance power over key on-chain assets is distributed across multiple entities, each of which is a DAO of its own. For example, DAOhaus core contributors (Warcamp) is a 30-person DAO with distributed governance powers.
* Non-circulating $HAUS is controlled by UberHaus, the DAO of DAOs. No DAO in UberHaus controls more than 10.5% of voting shares, and there is no path by which a DAO could gain additional voting shares without permission from a majority of peer DAOs.

The largest centralization vector is our front end hosting, over which a handful of developers have admin control. However, while an attack on the front end could manipulate what users see, the on-chain contracts (readable and writable via block explorers) remain the source of truth for all key user assets.

Our goal is to migrate our entire stack to decentralized infrastructure.

#### Market History:

The pool has been active since March 8, 2022.

* Current TVL: $2.1M
* Historical volume: $248k

## Description

veLIT stands for vote-escrowed Liquidity Incentive Token, it is simply LIT locked for a period of time. veLIT is the core component of Timeless' liquidity engine, [Bunni.pro](https://bunni.pro/). This engine is designed to maximize liquidity on Uniswap v3 by creating complex incentivization schemes. Timeless hopes that by launching LIT, other projects will be able to incentivize their token liquidity at a much higher level of efficiency on Uni v3. Additionally, Timeless use LIT and Bunni to bootstrap liquidity in its own yield token markets.

## How does Timeless work? 
Timeless is a yield tokenization protocol. You can provide assets to Timeless (e.g. 100 USDC) and mint PYT and NYT (e.g. 100 PYT and 100 NYT). The assets will be deposited into a farm, and the yield earned can be claimed by the PYT holders. By holding either only PYT or only NYT, you can build either a long position or short position on yield rates such as stETH or aUSDC.

## How does Bunni work?
Bunni is a liquidity engine that was built on top of Uniswap v3. It was initially released in October 2022 as a public utility that represents Uniswap v3 liquidity positions as fungible ERC-20 tokens instead of NFTs. This allows for more complex incentivization schemes to be created for Uniswap v3 liquidity. Since its initial release, Timeless has continued to improve and develop Bunni, turning it into a full-fledged liquidity engine, with improvements to its tokenomics inspired by protocols such as **Curve** and **Balancer**. These improvements aim to:
- Encourage the longevity of the protocol by disincentivizing farming-and-dumping and aligning the interests of liquidity providers and LIT holders
- Provide the protocol with a large treasury to fund growth and reduce LIT price volatility
- Maintain a high level of liquidity for LIT

## Specification
Transaction A will be executed immediately.

DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will transfer 50,000 BAL to `0x89f67f3054bFD662971854190Dbc18dcaBb416f6`

Then, DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `allowlistAddress` on `0x7869296Efd0a76872fEE62A058C8fBca5c1c826C` with the following argument:

contractAddress: `0x89f67f3054bFD662971854190Dbc18dcaBb416f6`

This will whitelist the veBAL locking contract to lock veBAL in the system.

Transaction B, to be executed some time later once ETH is transferred by Timeless:

DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `createLock` on `0x89f67f3054bFD662971854190Dbc18dcaBb416f6` with following arguments:

unlockTime: `1712959367` which corresponds to 4/12/2024 (max lock)
minAmountOut: `0` placeholder value for now

Once A is executed and the ETH is sent to the contract we can use tenderly sim to figure out if transaction B parameters need to be edited. This wouldn't require another vote, just forum post explaining reasoning.",bullish,7.235,2023-04-13 00:04:41+00:00,7.664,7.664,2023-04-14 00:00:00+00:00,5.92950932964753,7.210000000000001,-0.003455425017277,0.9299990236759186,True," In summary, Timeless is a yield tokenization protocol that allows users to provide assets (such as USDC) and mint PYT and NYT tokens. The assets are deposited into a farm, and the yield earned can be claimed by the PYT holders. By holding either only PYT or only NYT, you can build either a long position or short position on yield rates such as stETH or aUSDC.

Bunni is a liquidity engine built on top of Uniswap v3, designed to create more complex incentivization schemes for Uniswap v3 liquidity. It was initially released as a public utility that represents Uniswap v3 liquidity positions as fungible ERC-20 tokens instead of NFTs. Since its initial release, Timeless has continued to improve and develop Bunni, turning it into a full-fledged liquidity engine with improvements inspired by protocols such as Curve and Balancer.

The provided transaction details outline two steps:
1. DAO Multisig will transfer 50,000 BAL to a specific contract address, whitelisting the veBAL locking contract to lock veBAL in the system.
2. At a later time, after ETH is transferred by Timeless, the DAO Multisig will call `createLock` on the same contract with an unlock time of 4/12/2024 (max lock) and a placeholder value for `minAmountOut`. This step would be executed only after the ETH is sent to the contract, and the parameters might need to be edited based on simulation results. These steps wouldn't require another vote; just a forum post explaining the reasoning behind any parameter changes.",bullish,small

**Summary:**
> Proposal to add a gauge for the [WNCG/WETH Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xe8cc7e765647625b95f59c15848379d10b9ab4af0002000000000000000001de) on Ethereum mainnet.

    • Github Page: https://github.com/planetarium
    • Discord: https://discord.com/invite/planetarium
    • Twitter: https://twitter.com/NineChronicles

**Protocol Description:**

> Nine Chronicles is a fully decentralized free-to-play RPG, based on Scandinavian mythology, and the first title to be developed with Libplanet (https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet). Nine Chronicles runs on a P2P network of players without requiring any central server to host. The entire game, from crafting an item to complex battles, takes place fully on-chain.
>
> The first alpha test of Nine Chronicles started in 2019 Q2, and the mainnet was launched in 2020 Q4. Currently Nine Chronicles community is comprised of players from more than 100 countries. As Nine Chronicles is fully open source, there are a number of modded game clients developed by community members.
>
>Nine Chronicles Gold (NCG) is the in-game currency on its own blockchain network and it can be bridged to Ethereum mainnet. WNCG is the wrapped version of NCG. Nine Chronicles players can acquire NCG in various way including getting in the high ranks in Arena, selling an item, and running a node. Here is [the 2022 roadmap of Nine Chronicles](https://ninechronicles.medium.com/2022-nine-chronicles-roadmap-is-here-df3d2b8e6e0d) and WNCG price history can be viewed on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-ncg).

**Motivation:**

> Balancer’s weighted pool would help attract more liquidity with less impermanent loss comparing to 50/50 pool. Furthermore, adding the veBAL gauge will give bigger incentives to Nine Chronicles community members to deposit their tokens into Balancer pool, and will give deeper liquidity that would attract more users to trade on Balancer.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** The game protocol and Ethereum bridge is currently managed by multisig. The codes are fully open-source ([Nine Chronicles](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles), [NineChronicles.EthBridge](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles.EthBridge)) and the operations are fully shared and discussed in Discord.

2. **Oracles:** As the game and bridge are not using external information, the systems don’t rely on oracles. 

3. **Audits:** Here are the security [audit reports](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles.EthBridge/tree/main/docs) by Theori (won DEFCON CTF 5 times) and Certik for the Ethereum bridge.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Governance systems are yet to be fully decentralized and treasury functions are managed by multisig. The bridge is operated by using own Ethereum node adding to Infura.

5. **Market History:** As there is no DeFi protocol using WNCG, relevant events such as smart contract attacks or liquidations haven’t happened. There has been the Sushiswap pool for WNCG/ETH since MISO IDO in August 2021.

https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/307

### Introduction

There are some significant changes compared to the last funding proposal and I welcome community feedback as always.

Now that the treasury has a healthier supply of stablecoins and the DAO’s ongoing stablecoin costs look to be significantly lower in Year 2 I think it’s prudent to start paying the liquid portion of salaries in USDC. Thus the breakdown below will look a bit different from last quarter.

We’ll also be discontinuing Coordinape and adopting a bounty board for community contributors (this is based on feedback from the community and contributors themselves). We will share our learnings from our Coordinape experience soon. Previously 5000 BAL per month or $33,750 was allocated towards this, using last quarter’s BAL price of $6.75.

10,000 USDC per month will be allocated toward the community bounty board. This is expected to compensate regular contributors with clear roles like Cosme, Gleb, and Dubstard for their ongoing work while allowing the opportunity for others to also pick up tasks. The Maxis will own the setup and management of this board and also provide a report on the spend in the monthly forum update.

Previously we requested 8550 BAL per month for salaries or $57,712. For Q3 we request 31,210 in USDC and 8475 in BAL per month or $68,500. The increase is driven by two factors:

* Tritium’s salary is increasing a little over $5k vs last quarter - this better reflects a market salary for his skill set and his growing importance to the various operations of Maxis.
* To partially make up for the loss of Coordinape each Maxi was given an additional 200 BAL or 1000 USDC (aside from Tritium)

This does mean each Maxi aside from Tritium is taking an effective pay cut as average Coordinape rewards per person exceeded the above figures. I believe this is prudent given the challenging market conditions where we must be trimming costs as much as we can.

 
![bip-347-1.png](ipfs://bafkreick4g54svav42kw6jnj2ukvpuoc7f6idqjpv77x2fgnzshaqtlh7a)
    

Last quarter we asked for 1500 BAL for dev bounties. 875 BAL of that was spent, the details of which you can find in the below table. From this the Maxis have decided to pursue a retainer for Shakotan in the amount of 3000 USDC per month and 600 BAL to be max locked for the quarter. He will continue assisting us in our various Github repos to ensure our automated processes work as reliably and accurately as possible.

 
![bip-347-2.png](ipfs://bafkreibj64iwi2uulfx4ml5pbttawvsjxezeficbd5fnjriwttcymik5v4)
    

Finally, we’ll ask for an additional 20 ETH from the treasury for gas expenses. You can check out [this dashboard](https://dune.com/scoffie/maxigasstation?undefined=) we commissioned to track gas spending. This may require supplemental funding during the quarter depending on ETH gas prices and if gas intensive activities increase, such as poking additional layer zero cross chain rate providers.

**Service Provider Name:** Balancer Maxis

**Leader(s):** Solarcurve, joined by the returning cast of Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Danko, and Tritium.

**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** Yes

**Domains of Operation + Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**

As Balancer pursues its path for further decentralization, the Balancer Maxis workgroup presents community contributors aligned with the protocol's future and long-term sustainability. Whether proposing and executing innovative ideas, or protecting the interests of the ecosystem and helping third-party projects, Maxis have proven to be a key component of Balancer.

Our Q3 proposal is effectively asking veBAL Governance the continuation of this decentralized collaboration group, and reading on previous [Q2 funding post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-230-fund-the-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2023/4562) might bring some additional context to the present proposal.The following will be kept brief and at a high level. More granular metrics can be found in our monthly updates for April, May, and June.

*Multisig Management*

* Linear (boosted) pool settings
* Swap fee and amplification adjustments
* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL
* Adding new reward tokens to gauges
* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees
* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig
* Together with Balancer Labs we operate the Emergency subDAO Multisig

These are some of the basic functions required to ensure smooth operation of the Balancer Protocol for all its end users. We believe the best metric for success is that most users are not even aware that these tasks exist – they simply observe a new gauge being approved by voters then appearing on the voting list or find protocol fees in the claim section every week, etc. Maxis ensure that the various multisigs and their relevant functions are used properly and promptly, and all transactions are verified for accuracy by at least two people.

*Governance*

* We act as verifiers of last resort for BIPs that require on-chain execution and we post BIPs ready for a vote on snapshot - though anyone with 200k veBAL can also post to snapshot.
* Active participants in Discord and the Forum on governance topics
* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)
* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process
* Manage admin of the Governance Forum
* We will pursue various strategic initiatives (such as BIP-19) at our discretion, either individually or as a group.

*Automation and Tooling*

* We work with Mimic to sweep and process our collected fees into USDC.
* We run scripts that collect data and redirect fees to vote markets for veBAL holders to collect with their votes.
* We build, deploy and fund [[Chainlink Automation Upkeeps](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/main/chainlink_keepers)](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/main/chainlink_keepers) which handle regular operations for veBAL, and incentive management for our strategic partners.
* We continue to develop more reporting to help validate and verify submitted multisig payloads.
* We track and organize governance operations through the transparent and open [Balancer Multisig Operations repository](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops).
* We build and maintain internal tooling complex and common tasks such as pool creation and linear pool management.These tools are not polished/require some knowledge to operate, but we share them with some support in our bizdev and community support conversations.
* Members of the Maxis, often supported by external grants, build and maintain analytics for the Balancer ecosystem.

Maxis spend a good deal of time developing and conducting operational processes to keep fees flowing and governance systems operational and accurate. In 2023 we have started flexing our coding skills more and working to automate governance and partner liquidity management support operations in ways that are more “no-stop” and permissionless when possible.

*Partnerships*

* We manage Balancer’s Discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed
* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions
* We often deploy new pools for other projects
* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists
* We help with UI testing for Balancer
* Seek out new opportunities to apply Balancer’s technology, primarily in the DeFi realm
* Manage relationships with partners across the entire lifecycle from initial conversations to implementation to final results
* Coordinate partner needs with other teams in the Balancer ecosystem, e.g. integrations.

Maxis took the lead on partnerships in the Balancer ecosystem during Q4 2022 after the biz dev team at Orb was dissolved. The primary near term goals are expanding boosted pool offerings focused primarily on Aave v3, encouraging adoption of ve80/20 or similar systems, making Balancer the hub of LST liquidity, and increasing utilization of the veBAL flywheel (projects bribing, parking POL, etc). Generally we believe Balancer has made solid progress over the last few months on these initiatives.

*Community*

* We manage a bounty board, open to community contribution
* Onboarding framework for new contributors
* Discord moderation and security
* First responders to user support
* Bridging the community inquires to other Service Providers

This quarter’s proposal represents a big shift from the framework inherited from the Ops subDAO and the Coordinape reward system. Having an open community for new contributors wanting to join the Balancer ecosystem is a great concern for us. However, we have learned that bounties can attract higher quality and project-oriented contributors that might be more likely to be retained. Soon we will share more about our experience using Coordinape.

This new approach will allow the community’s marketing efforts currently under the Maxis to be handed out to Beethoven’s team plans for [community developments](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-314-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao-marketing/4810).

The legacy onboarding program will still be running, reaching every applicant through discovery calls to help contributors understand the DAO operating framework (BIP-1) and set in motion their ideas for Balancer.

*Project Management*

* Lead weekly meetings with team leads across the ecosystem to align on projects in flight
* Be the driving force behind the ecosystem’s top roadmap priorities and be accountable for their delivery
* Track project dependencies across the teams and coordinate among relevant parties

Maxis assumed the role of project management for the ecosystem in Q1. We are well positioned for this as we are the point of contact for outside teams & projects and we have established working relationships with all internal teams. Our experience in executing various initiatives in the last 9 months means we have a lot of insight into what it takes to take a project from start to finish.

*Record Keeping*

* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.

**Length of Engagement & Budget:**

3 months.

Budget of 34,210 USDC per month for salaries and 8,475 BAL per month, plus Shakotan’s 600 BAL for the quarter. We also request an additional monthly allocation of 10,000 USDC per month for the bounty board and a quarterly allocation of 20 ETH for gas expenses.

**Total for 3 month engagement: 132,630 USDC and 26,025 BAL and 20 ETH** (ETH is excluded in the following comparison).

*Comparison against last quarter:* Using today’s BAL price of $4.4 we’re requesting $247,140 this quarter. Last quarter we requested 42,150 BAL at a price of $6.75 or $284,512. Thus this quarter’s funding proposal represents a reduction in costs of $37,372.

**Funds to transfer:** 132,630 USDC and 25,400 BAL and 20 ETH (to reflect the unspent 625 BAL from last quarter’s dev bounties)

*Impact on the Treasury*: The Treasury currently holds ~4.5M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q3 would cost around 0.5% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.5M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~12%.

**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325

The focus is on three main areas: Community, Project Management, and Record Keeping.

1. **Community**: The community aspect includes managing a bounty board, providing an onboarding framework for new contributors, moderating Discord, handling user support, and bridging community inquiries to other Service Providers. A shift from the previous Coordinape reward system is being made towards a more project-oriented approach.

2. **Project Management**: Maxis has taken on the role of project management for the ecosystem, leading weekly meetings with team leads, driving the ecosystem’s top roadmap priorities, and coordinating among relevant parties to ensure project delivery.

3. **Record Keeping**: Detailed activity logs will be maintained for each controlled multisig, including documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig for future ease of transition.

The proposal is for a 3-month engagement with a budget of $132,630 USD per month, including salaries, BAL allocations, bounty board costs, and gas expenses. This represents a reduction in costs compared to the last quarter. The funds will be transferred to the ETH address: 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325.

The impact on the Treasury is minimal, with the proposed funding representing around 0.5% of the treasury’s BAL holdings and 3% of its USDC holdings. This annualizes to approximately 1.5% and 12%, respectively.",bullish,small

# Protocol Description:

## Jarvis Network

Jarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks.

The Synthereum protocol has four modules:

* Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed.
* Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types.
* Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio.
* Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools.

Most jFIATs have a direct fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi) or indirect (Monerium, Paytrie, Transfero etc.), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Aave, Midas, 0VIX), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy, Dotdot, etc.).

### Angle Protocol

Angle is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient. The protocol has launched agEUR, a Euro stablecoin, which has become one of the biggest decentralized Euro stablecoin. The TVL in the Angle Protocol is $46m with 30m agEUR in circulation.

There are different mechanisms (also called modules) by which agEUR can be issued all having in common that agEUR must be released on the market in an over-collateralized way.

- In the Core module of the protocol, agEUR can be minted from USDC, DAI and FRAX at oracle value. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by relying on the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol and by transaction fees. agEUR issued from this means represent the biggest share of the agEUR in circulation, and they are currently over-collateralized at 200%

- The protocol also has a borrowing module where agEUR can be borrowed against different assets (ETH, wBTC, wstETH) like on Maker. This module is deployed on different chains (including Polygon)

- The protocol is also engaged in algorithmic market operations (also called direct deposit modules). It has for instance minted agEUR natively on Aave and on Euler. In these cases, agEUR enter in circulation when they are borrowed in an over-collateralized way on the corresponding protocol. Protocol also mints agEUR on the agEUR-EUROC Curve pool when this pool has more EUROC than agEUR (like what FRAX is doing)

[agEUR](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ageur) has kept a super tight peg since its launch. It is involved in several other gauges on Curve as well (agEUR-EURs-EURt, agEUR-ibEUR, agEUR-EUROC-cEUR, agEUR-EUROC) which have historically yielded a pretty important volume.

# Motivation:

The role of the 2eur (agEUR) pool is to increase the stability of agEUR (1), the on-chain liquidity of both agEUR and jEUR (2), and connect the Angle and Jarvis ecosystems (3). Together, these 3 points allow for building an European DeFi ecosystem.

1. agEUR peg: on Polygon, agEUR is issued following the CDP model; if agEUR trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy agEUR cheaper and repay their debt; if agEUR trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow agEUR and sell them at a higher price; users can also perform a cross-chain arbitrage between Ethereum and Polygon (since on Ethereum one can swap agEUR for USDC at the EURUSD Chainlink price feed without price impact) but since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC, MAI and ETH back and forth at the EURUSD and computed ETH/EUR Chainlink price feed and without price impact on Polygon, arbitrages can be directly performed between the Balancer pool and the Jarvis Liquidity Pool to help maintain the agEUR peg.
2. On-chain liquidity:

* agEUR: since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC, MAI and ETH without price impact, then exchanging jEUR, ETH, MAI or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap agEUR to jEUR and then to USDC, MAI or ETH to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa. This considerably increases agEUR liquidity.
* jEUR: jEUR main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jEUR minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers, which is vital to us; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets), and agEUR has a deep liquidity on Polygon, to which jEUR can connect.

3. Connect ecosystems: the 2eur pool connects Angle and its agEUR liquidity and ecosystem to the jEUR’s, enabling multiple use cases.

* Credit without FX risk: borrow agEUR or jEUR, swap for jEUR or agEUR then off-ramp jEUR (Monerium, Mt Pelerin, etc.) or agEUR (Mt Pelerin, Monerium, …).
* Leverage short on EUR/XXX: borrow agEUR or jEUR, swap for jEUR or agEUR, swap for ETH, MAI or USDC, and repeat.
* DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: both agEUR and jEUR have a direct fiat on and off-ramp through Mt Pelerin, but it comes with a high fee. jEUR has an indirect 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium, so this pool can help users to buy agEUR with Euros or to sell agEUR for Euros.

### A few notes:

* Jarvis LTD has started building positions in BAL, TETU and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same positions.
* Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools for vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL etc. (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot).
* With Angle, we have been launching the 2eur (agEUR) pool on Curve. The 2eur pool did a volume of $14M since April 2022, with a TVL of $1-$3M, $6.9M of which were pure arbitrages. It is the most traded 2eur pool among PAR, EURT, EURS and EURe.
* Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield.
* Finally, we will also deploy a 2eur (agEUR) - bb-am-usd pool or a 2eur (agEUR) - 2eur (agEUR) - 2eur (EURT) - 2eur (EURe) - bb-am-usd pool depending on what would be the best for the liquidity and risk tolerance of LPs.

## Summary

This proposal aims to whitelist Tracer DAO’s ‘[Treasury Management Fund](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0xec0350ef1040fd328b78fb8dfbda879ed00f1795e78a01089401539f5f77f352)’ (**TMF**) in Balancer’s VotingEscrow contract to allow for the TMF to lock `BAL` (80/20 BAL/ETH) to participate in Balancer’s governance and direction of BAL emissions toward the Balancer ecosystem participants.

## Abstract

[Tracer DAO](https://tracer.finance/) is a decentralised derivatives infrastructure platform that aims to provide a product suite of capital efficient, risk management tools for communities. On behalf of Tracer DAO, we are appreciative of the relationship that has been cultivated with the Balancer community to date, particularly for facilitating the [secondary market liquidity](https://tracer.finance/radar/balancer/) of our ‘Perpetual Pools’ v1 product. To date, this has facilitated a total volume of ~$122.5m in trades.

Tracer DAO is currently working on a ‘v2’ of the Perpetual Pools financial contract which will be approximately launched within the next month. Tracer will continue to utilise Balancer as an ecosystem partner to provide secondary market liquidity.

Tracer DAO’s TMF ([multisig address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95E8C5a56ACc8064311d79946c7Be87a1e90d17f#tokentxns)) currently owns ~$158k staked in the BAL/ETH 80/20 pool on Balancer V2. If this proposal is successful, the TMF will be locking its holdings of BAL to gain access to veBAL to direct rewards toward Perpetual Pools secondary markets on Balancer, as well as towards the [TCR/DAI](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x96ba9025311e2f47b840a1f68ed57a3df1ea8747000200000000000000000160) pool on Balancer.

## Team

The Tracer DAO team team comprises of a globally distributed team ranging from experiences within DeFi, Tradfi and the blockchain data infrastructure layer. Additionally, we are joined by a strong array of [Strategic Partners](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-11-strategic-treasury-diversification/286) and Advisors.

Tracer DAO has partaken in audits from Sigma Prime, Runtime Verification, Spearbit/Secureum, Certik and is planning on conducting further audits with other top tier firms.

## Proposal specification

If this proposal is successful, the Balancer multisig will whitelist the Tracer Treasury Management Fund address (0x95E8C5a56ACc8064311d79946c7Be87a1e90d17f) to be able to lock `BAL` (80/20 BAL/ETH) to participate in Balancers veBAL model. The Balancer team would manually review this contract before whitelisting.

# Summary

> * **This is a proposal to enable a 10% capped Balancer gauge for a wstETH/WETH pool on Beethoven Optimism.** The pool is a custom pool from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture that will bring a new kind of concentrated liquidity to BeethovenX that is much more efficient and customizable compared to all other existing pool types. The pool is an E-CLP or Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool.
> 
> * **The wstETH/WETH pool is deployed on Optimism [here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x7ca75bdea9dede97f8b13c6641b768650cb83782#code), with this [root gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x730A168cF6F501cf302b803FFc57FF3040f378Bf) and this [Optimism gauge](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9f9f8d58496691d541c40dbc2b1b20f8c43e8d8c#readContract).** We ask for this pool to be designated as a 'Core pool'.

# Protocol description

> * stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. -[ Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)
> * wstETH is a wrapped version of regular stETH, while wETH is a wrapped version of Ethereum. 
> * The E-CLP uses an [internal conversion](https://github.com/gyrostable/vaults/blob/main/contracts/eclp/GyroECLPPool.sol#L723) to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.

*** 
# Motivation

> * **The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP) which enables trading along the curve of an ellipse.** This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens and it could generate significant trading volume. This pool will provide liquidity for the following pair: wstETH/wETH
> 
> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards BeethovenX. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.
> * **This pool will be launched in cooperation with BeethovenX.** With the core pool designation it would be possible to recycle protocol fees.
> * **We expect the E-CLP to be 1.67x as efficient as the comparable, live StableSwap pool with an amplification factor of 500.** The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:
>   * *Customizable liquidity profiles:* Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
>   * *Price bounds*: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.
> * **The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are illustrated by the recently deployed stMATIC/wMATIC E-CLP.** The below box plot shows stMATIC/wMATIC liquidity utilisation. The stacked area chart, shows how the E-CLP already reached up to 55% of the total market share of stMATIC on Polygon very quickly after inception, with only a fraction of the total TVL.

> * **Notably, the currently deployed stMATIC E-CLP is more oriented towards swap fee revenue for LPs.** It features a higher swap fee than comparable pools. As such, stMATIC E-CLP volume is subject to some fluctuations, and it is often the dominant pool on high volume days (as aligns with the stacked area chart).
>
> * **The wstETH E-CLP on Optimism, however, has a lower swap fee of 1bp and is more oriented towards becoming a core trading pool** with the potential to take a significant share of the total wstETH volume on Optimism.
> 
> * **E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD.** However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs)
*** 

> As a new pool design with more customizable concentrated liquidity, this pool has the potential to significantly expand the BeethovenX offering. The pool design even supports asymmetric liquidity concentration. Current LSTs may be locked on Curve and Balancer, but are disproportionately traded on Uniswap and KyberSwap (c.f. below graphic).
> 
> Gyroscope’s E-CLPs could change the LST landscape of BeethovenX by becoming low-slippage trading pools. However, some initial incentives may be required to bootstrap the pool and get to a minimum TVL that unlocks the pool’s potential. As demonstrated by the [stMATIC E-CLP](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/polygon/e-clp/0xf0ad209e2e969eaaa8c882aac71f02d8a047d5c2/), this amount, although necessary, does not need to be that large for the pool to be competitive, after which the pool can grow organically.

# Specifications

* ## Governance

> The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.

* ## Oracles

> * rateProvider0 (for WETH): 0x0 (none)
> * rateProvider1 (for wstETH): 0x9aa3cd420f830E049e2b223D0b07D8c809C94d15
> * (ETH per stETH wrapping rate)

* ## Audits

> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/audit-reports) (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.

* ## Centralization vectors

> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.

* ## Market History

> This pool has just been created. As such, there is no relevant market history for this pair in this pool. Ample historic data is available for this asset pair in different pools, e.g. on [BeethovenX on Optimism](https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb200020000000000000000008b) or on [Balancer Ethereum](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x32296969ef14eb0c6d29669c550d4a0449130230000200000000000000000080). For contract addresses of the wstETH E-CLP refer to the below ‘Contracts’ section.

* ## Value

> As per “Motivation”. Other Optimism pools with LSTs exist, but none of them feature asymmetrically concentrated liquidity. Asymmetric concentrated liquidity for these assets could become a substantial driver of trading volume and total value locked.

**Summary:**
> This is a proposal on behalf of InceptionLRT to enable a gauge for instETH/wstETH on Ethereum. instETH is the Restaked Token dedicated to stETH, obtained through InceptionLRT's restaking mechanism and platform. 
InceptionLRT is an isolated Liquid Restaking protocol for Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), enabling the restaking of various LSTs with the initial focus on stETH and rETH. Its core feature is the issuance of Isolated Liquid Restaking Tokens (iLRTs) for each restaked LST.

**Protocol Description:**

> InceptionLRT is an isolated Liquid Restaking protocol for Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), enabling the restaking of various LSTs with the initial focus on stETH and rETH. Its core feature is the issuance of Isolated Liquid Restaking Tokens (iLRTs) for each restaked LST. 
These iLRTs can be freely traded and used in other DeFi protocols while maintaining segregation from the underlying LSTs. This architecture addresses potential risks associated with basket-based LRTs like increased complexity, counterparty risk, and often unclear pool rebalancing rules.
InceptionLRT is specifically designed to bolster the EigenLayer framework by addressing a critical challenge: the issue of liquidity locking in the protocol. This advancement positions InceptionLRT as a key player in enhancing the fluidity and accessibility of restaking in the DeFi landscape.


**Motivation:**

> InceptionLRT aims to enable a gauge for instETH/wstETH to substantially increase the liquidity of instETH, while supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.

**Specifications:**
 
>1. **Governance:** ING holders participate in decision-making, influencing the protocol’s direction and policies, including the Node Operators, AVSs and restaking strategies.
Incentive Allocation: Through gauge weight voting, veING holders direct incentives and rewards towards preferred liquidity, impacting the protocol's dynamics.

Proposal to add a gauge for the RBN / USDC pool on Ethereum. 

Ribbon Finance intends to mass migrate liquidity from the primary RBN-USDC Uniswap v2/v3 pools to the RBN/USDC 50/50 Balancer pool. If the gauge is added, the Ribbon DAO will provide [25,000 RBN bi-weekly](https://snapshot.org/#/rbn.eth/proposal/0x43b63c97841d37d6658605db163907b4a33171e0447e56ff7983e89746d187fa) as voting incentives for the first two months. Aura Finance will match any incentives provided by Ribbon to help bootstrap liquidity. 

I propose that this gauge also be entered as a “core pool” under BIP-19 because this will be the primary on-chain RBN liquidity, Ribbon is heavily incentivizing, and the RBN circulating mcap is ~$100M. The pool will most likely be generating significant swap fees.

    • [Github Page](https://github.com/ribbon-finance)    
    • [Communities](https://discord.com/invite/ribbon-finance)

**Protocol Description:**

RBN is the governance token for the Ribbon Finance protocol. Ribbon is the first and largest DOV (decentralized options vaults) product. We make it easy to sell options on BTC, ETH, and alts. TVL is ~$60M. Similar to Balancer, Ribbon also has a ve mechanism in which holders can lock RBN to accrue protocol revenue from the options vaults. 

**Motivation:**

The fees and volume are partially driven by Balancer’s automated voting weight for Core Pools from Balancer Improvement Proposal 19. Furthermore, if the LP is approved for a gauge and receiving automatic voting weight, liquidity providers can earn additional yield through Aura Finance’s ability to boost BAL emissions and supplement with AURA emissions too.

Voting incentives for Aura holders has hovered around 2x in capital efficiency (Source on Llama airforce) over the last month. Meaning, if RBN or other rewards were provided to help bootstrap the liquidity it would be more capital efficient than typical liquidity mining.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Ribbon governance info can be seen [here](https://docs.ribbon.finance/ribbonomics/overview-and-rbn-tokenomics) and their snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/rbn.eth). Ribbon Finance DAO [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdaeada3d210d2f45874724beea03c7d4bbd41674).     

2. **Oracles:** The protocol relies on chainlink oracles on BTC, ETH, AAVE, and other assets to calculate the spot prices when determining options payouts in the DOV's.

3. **Audits:** We have Ribbon V2 vaults audits:

* V2 audits:
        - openzeppelin: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/ribbon-finance-audit/
        - chainsafe: https://github.com/ChainSafe/audits/blob/main/Ribbon%20Finance/RibbonV2-July-2021.pdf


4. **Centralization vectors:** Protocol assets are not accessible by any entity by design. Options payouts to the users and market makers are wholly determined via smart contracts and use of chainlink oracles. Protocol uses keepers to roll options over on a weekly basis.

5. **Market History:** [RBN price](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ribbon-finance). Balancer pool is recently launched.

https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/119

### Motivation

Balancer has recently deployed to Gnosis Chain and is actively streaming rewards to several pools on the network. As deploying to a new network comes with no permissions automatically granted to the DAO or any other entities within the ecosystem it is important we activate all pieces of the system upon granting permissions. Tritium proposed to do so [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-205-enable-relayers-on-gnosis-chain-and-add-other-missing-permissions/4451), and governance passed the vote. In order for the DAO to be compensated with the protocol fee on the pools deployed on the network, governance must approve the activation of the 50% protocol fee on any new networks. 

### Specification

The DAO Multisig `0x2a5AEcE0bb9EfFD7608213AE1745873385515c18` will interact with the ProtocolFeePercentagesProvider at `0x41B953164995c11C81DA73D212ED8Af25741b7Ac` and call `setSwapFeePercentage` using `0x4d44f0e9` twice. Once for the swap protocol fee, and once for the yield protocol fee.

The `newValue(uint256)` argument will be set to `500000000000000000`

#### Yield Protocol Fee:

# Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:

Balancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development. This proposal deals with the Administrative and Operational (Admin & Ops) element of the OpCo. It has been discussed in detail in this [draft BIP for year 2 funding](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-year-two/4882) and the comments there related to Admin & Ops should be considered as a part of this proposal.

The Product Development element of OpCo is dealt with in a separate proposal.

## Administrative & Operations

Serving as the operating entity with which third-party Service Providers to the Balancer DAO will contract, submit invoices to, and from which they will be paid whether that be in fiat or in tokens. This role is integral to the decentralised operations of the Balancer ecosystem, and in practice supports the healthy long term functioning of the DAO and the Balancer Protocol, and helps the DAO achieve its goals.

The Balancer OpCo will operate under the direction of the Balancer Foundation, which will oversee / have responsibility for governance, corporate administration and operations. This includes hosting and managing software subscriptions and login credentials for the OpCo team and certain ecosystem-wide platforms and social media accounts. An addition for year two is in-house Governance, Legal and Compliance (GRC) that the Ecosystem Council proposes be retained by OpCo as a new addition to the OpCo budget. As a reminder, the Foundation operates under the governance of the DAO.

A little more on GRC: given their experience with the Balancer Ecosystem, we are proposing Warburton continue this role. Hours are reduced under this proposed budget. In terms of scope, Warburton will provide GRC advice to support the [Balancer Ecosystem Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-198-creation-of-ecosystem-council-and-amended-self-insurance-fund/4409) which includes major service providers (SPs). Warburton will provide reporting to the Ecosystem Council as requested and protect confidentiality so Balancer has the ability to defend itself from unnecessary disclosure in litigation or government inquiries.

GRC services will be focused on protecting the resiliency, and facilitating the growth, of the ecosystem through the Council members (and major SPs). GRC efforts will protect Balancer by focusing on further decentralization strategy and implementation, US regulatory risks and Balancer objectives to understand and proactively protect against potential threats from legal/regulatory changes. GRC will also include keeping the Ecosystem Council current on matters of regulatory changes and sentiment, monitoring the GRC program including review of marketing/comms, conflicts of interest, VASP, sanctions and exemptions/exclusions from other evolving global requirements, assessment and negotiation of material contracts for disclosed council members and SPs and management of regulatory inquiries, investigations and/or litigation and strategy for Ecosystem Council with external counsel as needed. GRC will be handled “in-house” to extent practical to minimize external counsel costs and time. Please note that this is an internal facing role that will report to the Ecosystem Council including OpCo, not directly to the DAO. The scope of hours may be expanded to cover needs as pre-approved by OpCo. Warburton would operate on a 30-day notice period.

## Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):

Yes.

## Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:

Yes.

# Length of Engagement & Budget:

One year - July 2023 (Q3 FY23) through June 2024 (Q2 FY24) divided into four quarters.

The summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Community Hall calls and via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be returned to the Balancer Treasury, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal or other SPs.

The table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.

 
![opco1.png](ipfs://bafkreiftgnzjubhz7bobic73bm46y7tsnkazaj6dxrupm53gpq4ctzf4x4)
    

### Requests for USDC transfers:

The OpCo holds funds due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and Orb vs their original budgets in year 1. Estimated savings at the OpCo in year one have been partially allocated to fund the [Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) for Q3 FY23. The final savings figure will be known in Q3. We propose that USDC funding needs for OpCo be drawn from these funds, which are estimated to cover the twelve months of the OpCo budget based on current information.

Q3 FY23 - USDC 76,379 - cover with funds held at OpCo

Q4 FY23 - USDC 55,979 - cover with funds held at OpCo

Q1 FY24 - USDC 61,991 - cover with funds held at OpCo

Q2 FY24 - USDC 55,989 - cover with funds held at OpCo

### Request for BAL transfer:

Admin & Ops has no BAL requirements.

### Impact on the Treasury

The projected spend associated with this proposal (and that of the Product Development Team for a possible 9-month proposal) can both be covered by projected savings at OpCo and Orb, since we now have more recent data on those projections. Thus OpCo does not require any funding from the DAO Treasury to fund this proposal.

For objective comparison, the Treasury currently holds [~4.5M in USDC](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/year-2-sp-funding-impact-analysis/4921). OpCo holds ~1.4M in unallocated USDC (resulting from the savings mentioned), together ~5.9M in USDC. Funding this proposal for the year would cost around 4% of combined current unallocated OpCo funds and current Treasury USDC (not including the impact of projected revenue during the period).

### Non-People Costs - Operations & Administration

The main items in this section are legal and compliance costs (more below), monthly bookkeeping service (we continue to perform the “CFO” element in house for the foreseeable future in order to keep costs down). We have included a $20,000 estimate in Q3 for Directors and Officers insurance - actual costs could be materially different. Software subscriptions included here are for operations (G-suite, QBO) and ecosystem-wide services such as Dune Analytics, Discourse, Slack, Notion and Asana. Q3 2023 includes a one-off amount of $10,000 in case a deposit is required for a new bank account.

The largest increase relates to in-house Governance, Legal and Compliance (GRC) that the Ecosystem Council proposes be retained by OpCo as a new addition to the OpCo budget, effective 1 August, 2023. As mentioned, we are proposing Warburton continue this role. Hours are reduced under this budget compared with year one, to a fixed monthly fee of $10,500, or $115,500 for 11 months. If this needs to be revisited it will be dealt with in a future proposal.

The total amount sought for Non-people costs, Operations and Administration is USDC 250,338. Broken down by category:

* Administrative costs: USDC 11,800 - Registered Office/Agent, Registrar of Companies Fees, Annual Compliance Services, Bank fees, Gas fees, hardware wallet if needed.

* Directors’ and Officers’ insurance: USDC 20,000 (estimate)

* Establishment of new banks account(s): USDC 10,000 (estimate)

* Internal GRC - total for the year (11 months in this case) USDC 115,500. This represents the minimum internal GRC support required for the items mentioned in the proposal - that is - the day-to-day of the operations. To keep the budget lean, we have removed the proposed buffer budget that was in the previous draft. 

The fixed part of the proposed GRC amount represents 20 hours per month (roughly 5 hours per week) at USCC 525 per hour. This is the USDC 10.5k per month. For baseline, Warburton is currently contracted to Balancer at 20 hours per week (not through OpCo) and is fully occupied. This budget is a 75% reduction in time, and therefore yet to be seen how it works. We have edited this proposal to remove the buffer, and will raise a specific proposal should the need arise on a specific matter.

There is a cost benefit of having someone experienced that can cover multiple issues, jurisdictions, entities and topics - for illustration one person’s hourly rates vs having multiple specialists and having two or more lawyers on a call, all charging per hour. With this proposed arrangement, GRC would support the Foundation, OpCo, B Labs, Beets, Maxis and other members of Ecosystem Council as well as major SPs. This resource would not just be dedicated to providing services to one entity.

* The estimate for external GRC is USDC 24,000 for the year. 

* Bookkeeping / Accounting services estimated at USDC 24,000 for the year (USDC 2,000 per month). This also is a very low budget given industry comparables, but we are hopeful of achieving this.

* Software services for the Ecosystem and OpCo administration USDC 45,038

This follows the same timeline as the previous migration proposed [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-241-aave-v3-migration/4617), giving LPs enough time to migrate their positions and new pools to bootstrap themselves in the BIP-19 cycles. See qETH's original [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-127-adding-a-gauge-for-the-new-qeth-eth-pool-w-2-emissions-cap-ethereum/4038/3) for relevant information to their token.

We will be coordinating with the various bribe marketplaces to ensure all future voting incentives only go towards the new gauges. The old pool will no longer have core pool status, the new pool / gauge will be a “core pools” under BIP-19. The 2% gauge cap will be maintained in the new gauge.

## Pool being migrated:

978,1772,4859,4859,4859,2022-05-23 10:56:33+00:00,balancer,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/form-the-emergency-subdao/3197)

# Motivation

The [Emergency DAO](https://dao.curve.fi/emergencymembers) is an idea pioneered by Curve that empowers a small group to “kill” pools and gauges in the event of malicious activity and/or potential loss of funds. So far the power has only been used once to [kill the Mochi pool](https://gov.curve.fi/t/the-curve-emergency-dao-has-killed-the-usdm-gauge/2307).

This proposal is being presented as a response to the situation Balancer is facing regarding the three element pools ([1](https://app.element.fi/pools/0xEdf085f65b4F6c155e13155502Ef925c9a756003?action=redeem))([2](https://app.element.fi/pools/0x4bd6D86dEBdB9F5413e631Ad386c4427DC9D01B2?action=redeem))([3](https://app.element.fi/pools/0x7Edde0CB05ED19e03A9a47CD5E53fC57FDe1c80c?action=redeem)) which were grandfathered into the gauge voting system when veBAL launched. A single LP has staked in the gauges and has bribed on hidden hand to entice voters while this single actor collects all the emissions.

Given that these element pools have expired they should no longer be eligible for BAL emissions.

The Emergency subDAO will be a 4-of-7 multisig with the following members:

* Solarcurve (0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3)
* Mike B (0xF01Cc7154e255D20489E091a5aEA10Bc136696a8)

Gnosis safe address: `0xA29F61256e948F3FB707b4b3B138C5cCb9EF9888`

A governance proposal will be required to change signers of this multisig. To be clear, Balancer’s Emergency subDAO will only have the power to kill gauges. Balancer pools cannot be “killed” by governance after the pool factory has been deployed for three months.

An additional power of the Emergency subDAO will be to add a token to the deny list on the newly created “[ProtocolFeesWithdrawer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introduce-protocolfeeswithdrawer/3188)” contract. In order for a token to be added back to the allow list a veBAL governance vote would be required. A token would only be added to the deny list in the event of an issue along the lines of the recent [Synthetix bug disclosure](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/medium-severity-bug-found/3161).

**Motivation**
> 
> This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the Balancer Aave v3 Boosted Pool (bb-a-USD) on Arbitrum.
>  
> There are wrappers for depositing funds into Aave Reserves, the linear pools, already deployed, utilise the wrapper developed by Aave Companies. This is the same wrapper used across all Aave linear pools.  
> 
> Balancer will be able to generate revenue from the yield generated by user's funds being deposited into Aave v3.
> 
> This pool uses the ComposableStablePoolFactory-v3 1 which addresses the [reentrancy vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345) disclosed during February 2023. This gauge is uncapped, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329). A portion fo the yield also allocated to bribes via Hidden hand there is a feedback loop which helps sustain the pool.

**Specifications**
> 
> 1. **Governance:** AAVE and stkAAVE serve as the governance tokens for the Aave DAO. Holders can vote on proposals at both a Snapshot level and through the Aave DAO [on-chain governance portal](https://app.aave.com/governance/).

**Motivation:**

Based on the partnership between Balancer and Beethoven X, the joint deployment on Optimism is managed by Beethoven X. Up to now, there was no formal agreement that grants Beethoven X the power to distribute liquidity mining incentives on behalf of Balancer. This BIP grants permission to Beethoven X to distribute incentives, such as grants, on the Optimism chain and therefore adding Beethoven X Contributors to the Balancer Optimism Fees + LM multisig. This grants Beethoven X the power to enact the responsibility to operate the Optimism deployment.

This proposal aims to update the multisig to a 3/6 multisig with 3 signers from Beethoven X and 3 signers from Balancer.

### Summary

This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for a sUSDe/GYD E-CLP on Ethereum. 

We propose to only enable protocol fees of 50% once rewards start. The entire protocol fees will accrue to Balancer, while Gyroscope will not take any cut at this point.

### Protocol description

* sUSDe accrues rewards and can be obtained by staking USDe. USDe is a ""delta-neutral synthetic dollar"" issued by [Ethena](https://ethena.fi/).
* GYD is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by the [Gyroscope protocol](https://gyro.finance/).

---

### Motivation

Gyroscope is further expanding its liquidity network around GYD by adding a direct route to sUSDe.

---

### Specifications

#### Governance

The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.

#### Audits

Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.

#### Centralization vectors

No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.

#### Market History

* The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available [here ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).
* This is the first sUSDe/ GYD pool.

**References**

[Website] [https://www.olympusdao.finance/ ](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)

**Protocol Description**

Olympus DAO is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the OHM token. Each OHM token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. UST, DAI, FRAX, wETH) in the Olympus treasury, giving it an intrinsic value. Olympus also introduces novel economic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding.

**Motivation**

Recently Olympus DAO seeded a tri-pool with OHM-DAI-wETH with the intention of utilizing the pool for the Olympus Incubator program. The original intention was that protocols can use Copper or PrimeDAO to raise in OHM, bringing volume through Balancer. However, Olympus is now interested in growing the pool further to facilitate a deeper meta pool for prospective partners and to deepen its relationship with Balancer. To this end, Olympus is proposing a BAL gauge for the pool, which will draw additional third party capital and allow Olympus to begin participating in governing the burgeoning Balancer ecosystem.

**Specification**

**Governance:** OlympusDAO is governed by OHM and gOHM token holders through snapshot votes and forum proposals.

**Oracles:** No use of oracles within the OlympusDAO protocol.

**Audits:** Same link as above within docs.

**Centralization vectors:** Specific treasury functions are controlled through a multisig, however Olympus has made it a focal point of its mission to work toward full decentralization including the treasury and full on-chain governance. Olympus is currently in discussions with Balancer to be a key component of the shift to on-chain governance.

**Market History:** OHM launched and was made transferable on March 23rd with incentives for users to provide liquidity in exchange for the OHM token. OlympusDAO using the veBAL voting system to boost BAL rewards for its OHM pools along with Olympus ecosystem partners.

THX Network allows creators and communities to create and embed ERC20 and ERC721 tokens in their platforms and social channels. The project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under agreement No 82888 (Blockpool) and No 824509 (Block.IS).

$THX is the project’s governance token launched in dec. 2021 using a Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) and has its main source of liquidity on Balancer’s Polygon deployment (~$900k TVL).

Our emerging DAO is about to diversify its treasury into $BAL and participate in Balancer’s governance.

### **Introduction**

Whitelist the BadgerDAO Gnosis Safe multisig, to vote-lock B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the BadgerDAO community into veBAL and participate in governance for the Balancer DAO.

### **Motivation**

BadgerDAO is a well established DAO which seeks to build the infrastructure for Bitcoin in DeFi. We make it easy to bridge your Bitcoin into other blockchains and start earning yield right away. We are big fans fo the Balancer ecosystem and are looking forward to participating in governance and incentivizing more liquidity to flow through Balancer.

### **Risks**

BadgerDAO multisig signers recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

*If approved, this vote would send 200k BAL to a new Ribbon Vault - effectively doubling our allocation towards call writing strategies.*

## Summary
In July 2022 Balancer passed [BIP-24](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-24-allocate-bal-to-a-ribbon-finance-vault/3209/7) which allocates 200K BAL (~$1.3M) to a Ribbon BAL Covered Call treasury vault. The call-writing strategy has significantly outperformed buy-and-hold since inception, earning **221,885.41 USDC** for the Balancer subDAO [treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f).

Currently, **4.16%** (200K / 4.8M BAL) of the treasury BAL is allocated to the Ribbon vault. We propose to **increase** the allocation of BAL to the vault.
## Motivation
The original rationale for BIP-24 still stands today:
1.  We are still in the midst of a significant bear market both for the price of BAL and for DeFi assets overall. This thesis was validated since BIP-24 8 months ago: BAL has remained range-bound between ~$4.5 - ~$7.8 from July to March (fig. 1).
2.  The DAO wanted to explore ways to bolster stablecoin reserves – indeed the strategy has shown results, earning 221K USDC on $1.3M worth of BAL.

**![](upload://v1E89zbqchEGyfyAfkdFP8Nm5eF.png)**
*Figure 1*


We think it is prudent to increase the allocation **at this time** for the following reasons:
1.  Implied volatility has been picking up recently, thus, selling calls is more attractive and is rewarding sellers more appropriately for the risk they are taking. One can observe below the 2-weeks implied volatility of ETH, which is a good proxy to see how implied volatility is moving for altcoins too (fig. 2).
2.  Since BIP-24, more market makers and institutional players have been participating in Ribbon Auctions for altcoins, making the bidding process more competitive. As a result, over the 8 months these options trade at increasingly tighter spreads and higher premiums, effectively generating more revenue for the DAO.
3.  While the strategy has been performing well so far, the current performance is quite path-dependent and we could structure this second vault to reduce the path-dependency of the initial covered call strategy (see implementation).

![](upload://q5CmqHotQjiD0oMLUkMNhub8ZKi.png)
*Figure 2*

### Current Strategy
Since inception, the current strategy generated **221,885.41 USDC**. This converts to **22.58%** realised yield using the initial BAL deposit of 200k BAL, which was worth roughly $982,681.77. Using the current BAL price of $6.58, this converts to **16.86%**.

It is possible that some of the following options end up in-the-money in which case the strategy may have a lower return and possibly underperform buy-and-hold. I want to refrain from using “APR” for this very reason, since it is a trade and not a loan, but annualizing both figures, this would convert to **33.23%** and **24.13%** APR respectively.

Out of the 8 trades expired, only one expired in-the-money, resulting in a loss of 3,474.75 BAL.
One can compare the current strategy to a simple buy-and-hold strategy by looking at the graph below.

**![](upload://1d2VutkKAaz169lwHOfdDmQ501Z.png)**
One can find the raw data below.
**![](upload://95wX7zTEjvn7fvmlP9d64JmEa0Z.png)**
The current covered call strategy is outperforming the buy-and-hold strategy significantly so far.
## Implementation
While the current strategy is selling monthly 25% OTM options, we propose to also sell biweekly 20% OTM options. As this strategy will be rebalanced on different schedules and different strikes will be chosen compared to the monthly strategy, it will effectively reduce the path-dependency of the overall portfolio, leading to lower drawdowns overall. The amount of BAL we allocate needs to match the BAL in the current strategy for it to be effective.

In the current market conditions, the additional biweekly layer is expected to yield **1.22%** every two weeks (paid out in USDC). Obviously, this premium will change on a trade per trade basis but if you want to have an idea of what it would mean in APR terms, this converts to an APR of **31.69%**.

This proposal will be a vote on how much to increase the current strategy by, and by extension the allocation for the biweekly 20% OTM options strategy.
## Conclusion
Since July 2022, this strategy has earned 221,000 USDC on $1.3M BAL for the subDAO due to a bearish / sideways / low realized volatility thesis. We believe these conditions will continue for a while given the macroeconomic. If the community agrees with this thesis, then it may be prudent to double-down (7%-15% treasury allocation) to increase profits and minimize path dependency.
## Risks
**Market Risk:** The primary risk for running this covered call strategy is that the vault may incur a biweekly loss in the case where the call options sold by the vault expire in-the-money (meaning the price of BAL is above the strike price of the call options minted by the vault).

**Smart Contract Risk:** The Theta Vault smart contracts have been [audited by OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/ribbon-finance-audit/) and [ChainSafe](https://github.com/ribbon-finance/audit/blob/master/reports/RibbonThetaVault%20V2%20Smart%20Contract%20Review%20And%20Verification.pdf). Balancer has been in this strategy for 8 months without smart contract exploits– despite that, we always advise to exercise caution and only risk funds they can afford to lose.

## Voting
This vote is to determine whether to allocate 200k BAL to this new Ribbon Vault. Note that the depositor (the Balancer subDAO) has the flexibility to downsize the position, add to the position, or exit the strategy entirely.

### Specification

If approved, the DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call approve on the BAL token contract `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` with spender `0xA06a03d72F1b6350b3aA75524863823eB14dC864` and amount `200000000000000000000000`.

This will allow the new Ribbon vault contract to spend 200k BAL.

Then the DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call deposit on the Ribbon vault contract `0xA06a03d72F1b6350b3aA75524863823eB14dC864` with amount `200000000000000000000000`

The vote will decide on allocating 200k BAL to this new Ribbon Vault, which could potentially increase profits and minimize path dependency under the current market conditions.

The primary risk is market risk, as the vault may incur a biweekly loss if the call options sold expire in-the-money. The smart contracts have been audited by OpenZeppelin and ChainSafe, but it's always advised to exercise caution when investing funds.

## Protocol Description
CoW Protocol lets people swap assets MEV protected at the best exchange rate by leveraging its batch settlement layer built on top of DeFi’s favorite AMMs and DEX Aggregators. Instead of directly executing trades on-chain, users only sign their swap intention and delegate the execution to so-called solvers (aka relayers in other protocols). Solvers bid on the best possible exchange rate in order to win the right to settle trades. By batching multiple trades together in order to create CoWs (Coincidence of Wants), solvers can save on gas costs, AMM fees and execution risk. Therefore CoWs lead to structurally better prices than on any existing DEX aggregator. In the absence of CoWs solvers fall back to using the best possible on-chain route, by comparing quotes from leading aggregators.

## Motivation
Strengthen the COW and BAL communities ties by giving a reward in COW tokens for veBAL voters, while increasing BAL rewards to COW liquidity providers. More in CowDAO proposal [here](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-using-cow-to-boost-bal-rewards-for-cow-lps/783)

4.  **Centralization vectors**: Orderbook and solver competition are still hosted on a server although decentralizing this part of the stack is on the roadmap.

**Summary:**

This is a proposal to enable uncapped Balancer gauge for inETH/wstETH pool on Optimism.

**Protocol Description:**

InceptionLRT is an omnichain liquid restaking protocol offering both Native and Isolated restaking to users. Powered by the Flash Unstake mechanism and supported by node operators with DVT Technology, InceptionLRT aims to become the most complete liquid restaking protocol in DeFi. The isolated architecture combined with the flash unstake feature solves the only drawback of isolated LRTs - liquidity fragmentation! inETH is the native LRT that users get by depositing ETH.

stETH is a rebase token by Lido that also represents staked ether but instead of the exchange rate accumulation method, the staking rewards are given as extra stETH. Effectively, stETH always stays pegged 1:1 with ETH and stETH token balances are updated when the oracle reports the change in the total (initial deposit + staking rewards) every day. wstETH is the wrapped version of regular stETH which allows for stETH accumulation in the contract and turns the rebase model of stETH into the C-token model of other LSTs.

**Motivation:**

Substantially increase the liquidity of inETH on Optimism.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** ING holders participate in decision-making, influencing the protocol’s direction and policies, including the Node Operators, AVSs and restaking strategies.

Xave Finance (pronounced “Save Finance”) aims to enable financial services companies (such as “fintechs'' and neobanks) to leverage DeFi for actual use cases, such as real time remittance transfers and high yield consumer savings. Xave does this by building an FX accurate AMM via a custom “FXPool '' now and eventually a stablecoin lending market that shares liquidity with the Balancer V2 Vault via a BoostedFXPool.


**References/Useful links:** 
Pasting links in reply due to new user limit

**Protocol Description:**
Xave has deployed its first custom pool type - the FXPool - that brings FX markets and lending to the Balancer DAO. 

**Motivation:** **“Bringing FX markets to the Balancer ecosystem”**

Stasis, the licensed issuer of fiat backed stablecoins EURS, and its community will be supporting this pool to enable liquid FX trades and eventually work towards instant, on chain cross border remittance between Europe and Asia (EUR-SGD, EUR-PHP, EUR-IDR). Leading blockchain providers have tried to achieve this “on demand liquidity” but stablecoin FX is the true 10x improvement to traditional financial rails. This is especially true as stablecoin rails are able to offer end to end remittances at <1 % per transaction (if anyone is interested, we have a real world cost breakdown). This real world use case will bring sustainable fee generation via real economic activity to the BalancerDAO. Xave would like to work with the BalancerDAO to incentivize this initial pool with BAL rewards towards a real world use case in DeFi.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:**
Governance will be done via snapshot for now. Later on Xave’s own VE governance structure will be deployed (forked from veBAL). Current admin of the EURS:USDC FXPool is the team’s ops 3/3 multisig 0xA4d521ae4302ffcf3cD5b257B45B16DAC726A057 (Ethereum Mainnet), until the community is ready to take on ownership of the Xave protocol. The FXPools have various parameters (read more https://docs.xave.co/product-overview-1/amm) that affect the range of FX accurate swaps across the bonding curve. These parameters are updated and optimized over time, thus the need for nimble response while the pool is new.

2. **Oracles:** 
The EURS:USDC FXPool utilizes a Chainlink oracle to allow FX accurate swaps for a predetermined range of the bonding curve. Beyond this range (called the “beta region”), LP ratio then dictates the price of trades. At this point, arbitrageurs are incentivized by significantly cheaper fees to trade the pool back to the “beta region” where FX price is followed. LPs are also incentivized to keep liquidity in the pool especially while it is outside the “beta region”, due to existing parameters that yield much higher fees charged to traders swapping the pool away from the “beta region”. See linked docs to learn more

3. **Audits:** **[v2 Final Audit - Xave Finance](https://docs.xave.co/contract-audits/v2-final-audit)**

4. **Centralization vectors:** 
3/3 operations multisig that owns contracts until contracts are “battle tested” and community is ready to takeover. The owner of the pool will be changed to the Balancer recommended address 0xbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalb once the pool has been running for sometime without issue to allow for quick response time in the event of an emergency. Until then the Xave operations multisig will be assigned as the pool’s owner.

5. **Market History:** 
EURS is an asset backed stablecoin, fully collateralized and issued by Stasis - the licensed issuer of fiat backed stablecoin EURS. USDC is an asset backed stablecoin issued by Circle

Enable gauge on the wUSDR bb-am-usd Stable pool

• [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tangibleDAO) 

**Protocol Description:**

Real USD (USDR) is a stablecoin backed by tokenized Real Estate that natively yields 8-10%. It was created by Tangible, a RWA tokenization protocol.

Backing a stablecoin with Real Estate has 2 key competitive advantages that we believe add significant value to the stablecoin landscape:

1) Yield - The tokenized properties in the Real USD treasury are leased to tenants. This rental yield is paid out daily to holders in the form of a rebase.

In addition to this if Real USD ever falls beneath 100% collateralization ratio, 50% of the daily rebase is instead added to the treasury to re-collateralize USDR.

2) Real Estate price appreciation - When priced in FIAT Real Estate has a long predictable history of appreciation. Over the last 50 years, the average sales price of a house in the United States grew from $27,000 in Q1 1970 to $383,000 in Q1 2020.

This appreciation in the backing of USDR allows for [interesting design mechanisms](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/minting-from-system-gains) that contribute to additonal yield and lindyness of the system.

History:

Tangible has been around for 18 months tokenizing Fine wine, Gold bars, watches and most recently Real Estate. After tokenizing our first property we conceptualized Real USD.

Real USD has only been around a few months. We launched V1 with a slightly different design which after launch we realized could be improved significantly with “minting on gains”, so we quickly launched V2 and are now ready to scale liquidity and market cap. We have spent significant time sourcing a backlog of properties that are ready to be tokenized to ensure that as the USDR market cap grows, the treasury and yield can scale.

**Motivation:**

Real USD (USDR) is new, we are looking for ways to grow deep liquidity for it. Balancer’s mechanism for automatically bribing pools with yield bearing assets is what initially grabbed our attention and drew us here, as it will highlight the structural advantages of backing a stablecoin with yield producing Real Estate.

**Specifications:**

1. Governance: Real USD, the treasury composition and changes to the design will be governed by locked TNGBL token holders, this governance is not yet in place but will be soon. [4 of 5 multisig ](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x100fCC635acf0c22dCdceF49DD93cA94E55F0c71)already required for any changes.

2. Oracles: We have our own oracles for properties at the moment, but are working with Chainlink to get set up, then true property valuations via 3rd party Hometrack.com can be reflected on chain in Real Time so the treasury values and the collateralization ratio are upto date, this also allows for “minting on gains” to work more effectively in real time.

3. Audits: Our first audit completed, final version of report will be ready this week then will share here. (No major issues)

4. Centralization vectors: The Real Estate obviously exists in the real world as is managed by an entity, Tangible Custody, this entity collects rent and converts to USDC and sends to the rent smart contracts.

5. Market History: In our short time since launch we have not lost peg.

6. Value: We have a pool on Curve but intend to only provide bribes and incentives on Balancer due to the advantages provided by BIP-19

title: [Proposal] Whitelist the Aave Mainnet Reserve Factor for Balancer’s VoteEscrow
status: Proposed
author: @Matthew_Graham (Llama)
created: 23-04-2022

---

# Summary

The proposal aims to add Aave DAO’s Reserve Factor address to the Balancer VotingEscrow whitelist. This will enable the Aave Community to vote-lock BAL (B-80BAL-20WETH) and participate in Balancer DAO’s governance, [1].

# Abstract

Llama has published proposals on the Aave DAO and Balancer DAO governance forum for both communities to perform a 200,000 BAL for AAVE tokenswap, [2,3,4]. Upon completing this tokenswap, Aave intends to deposit BAL and ETH into the B-80BAL-20WETH pool. This proposal is to enable Aave to vote-lock BAL (B-80/20 BAL/ETH) and become an active contributor within the Balancer governance process.

# Motivation

Aave and Balancer communities have a long working relationship. Aave has incorporated the 80/20 AAVE/ETH Balancer V1 BPT into the Safety Module and intends to upgrade to using a Balancer V2 pool in time. Meanwhile, Balancer’s USDC/DAI/USDT Boosted Pool uses Aave V2 in the background as a source of yield for liquidity providers. Both communities have demonstrated the ability to work together and create value for each other’s community. The tokenswap is the next logical step in creating an ever stronger relationship.

At the time of writing the Aave mainnet Reserve Factor holds 1,924 aBAL and this will become around 201,924 BAL post tokenswap, [2,5]. If the Aave community elects to proceed with an on-market purchase of 100,000 BAL, the total BAL holding will become 301,924 and Aave will become one of the Top 30 holders [6,7]. Aave intends to use the veBAL holding to actively participate in Balancer’s governance process and to support the pools that lead to funds being deposited into Aave markets and/or Safety Module.

# Risks

No significant risks have been identified in connection with the proposed transaction.

# Specification

Whitelist `0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c` to interact with the veBAL contract, [5].

5. **Market History:** 
>* GHO is yet to be released by the Aave DAO.
>* For LUSD, there can be a small premium on LUSD results from a structural unbalance between offer and demand. The situation led to a considerable demand surge for censorship-resistant stablecoins that only LUSD can answer since there is no other alternative with a significant TVL. Nevertheless, hard peg mechanisms are built into the system between $1 and $1.10, and soft peg incentives in between. Further, Chicken Bonds are also helping to reduce the stablecoin premium, and this effect will strengthen as the protocol grows.

6. **Value:**
>* The BPT from this pool has the potential to be included in the Aave Safety Module which will provide a source of rewards encouraging users to deposit into the liquidity pool creating TVL and swap fee revenue for Balancer DAO.

994,1800,4938,4938,4938,2022-04-25 18:25:37+00:00,balancer,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/fdt-weth-80-20-gauge-nested-pool-consideration/2954)

**Summary:**
The FIAT DAO community is proposing the following pools be given a veBAL gauge:

* [FDT/ETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x2d344a84bac123660b021eebe4eb6f12ba25fe8600020000000000000000018a)
* *FDT/OHM-ETH-DAI*
* *FIAT/staBAL3*

Note that while the FDT/ETH pool has been set up already by the FIAT DAO community, the other pools, as they are nested pools, require deployment support from the Balancer team which is underway at the time of posting this proposal. 

All pools should be deployed at the time, or shortly thereafter, when voting for this proposal starts ($FIAT launch is imminent). If need be, the two nested pools can be a separate proposal.

**References/Useful links:**

* See [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/fiatdao) due to forum link restrictions for new members

**Protocol Description:**

The FIAT protocol is a DeFi-native repo market solution for providing liquidity to holders of fixed income assets. It allows users of apps like Element Finance, Notional Finance, and Yield Protocol to bring their proofs of liquidity to the protocol in order to collateralize a debt position in $FIAT, a stable value asset. Our v1 has just launched, and it’ll look and feel familiar for users who have previously minted DAI, RAI, or MIM. By utilizing proven stablecoin mechanisms, the protocol is able to offer competitive borrowing power to holders of such collateral assets, allowing them to releverage fixed yields or meet current liabilities as the locked assets mature.

$FDT is the governance token associated with FIAT DAO. In its current iteration, $FDT confers voting power for users to participate in decision-making around protocol parameters. We are currently underway with an implementation of a v2 specification in which $FDT allows users to gauge behind supported collateral types in order to allocate a protocol backstop and inform algorithmic interest rates. We anticipate that the 80/20 FDT/ETH BPT will be the primary governance power-conferring asset in the updated DAO architecture.


**Motivation:**

FIAT DAO has expressed its desire to become a material player in veBAL governance going forward, as can be seen by a forum discussion accessible via the Linktree above. To achieve this, we are willing to commit DAO funds for the acquisition of voting power and the bribing of existing veBAL participants. For such strategies to have the greatest impact, we are keen to deepen $FDT secondary liquidity. Acquiring a veBAL gauge for the FDT/ETH pool, as well as for the FDT/OHM-ETH-DAI pool, will allow the DAO to move over existing protocol owned liquidity and engage in the Hidden Hand marketplace. As FIAT DAO proves itself a reliable partner to the Balancer ecosystem and the FIAT protocol gets more time in the wild, we hope to be in a position to conduct a DAO token swap at some point in the future as well.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** FIAT DAO is a completely on-chain organization, with no corresponding real world entity in place. The FDT token has been given away for free since November of 2021, and a DAO smart contract architecture has been live since December 2021.

2. **Oracles:** $FDT is a standard ERC-20 DeFi governance token that comes with the volatility inherent to the sector. $FIAT is a DAI-like asset that will come to be backed by less liquid derivatives, but at the moment only supports collateral types with existing secondary markets.

3. **Audits:** Audits of our protocol and our collateral oracle system can be found in the Security repo within our Github (again, see Linktree).

4. **Centralization Vectors:** $FDT holders determine which assets are supported as collateral and the parameters associated with each.

## Summary

Proposal to add gauge support for the new [osETH/ETH Composable Stable](https://app.balancer.fi/#/1/pool/0xdacf5fa19b1f720111609043ac67a9818262850c000000000000000000000635) with a 10% gauge cap.

## Protocol Description

StakeWise was the first non-custodial liquid staking solution on Ethereum, launched in early 2021, with a little over 100k ETH currently staked. After over a year of development and testing, the V3 upgrade is now live on Mainnet. StakeWise V3 is the (Gnosis) Safe of ETH staking, a free public good that aims to fully democratize the staking ecosystem and greatly improve the decentralisation of staked capital. Any entity can offer trustless, non-custodial staking-as-a-service via an open marketplace that gives stakers the ability to delegate to their preferred operators/staking solutions. For more details about StakeWise V3, please refer to the [StakeWise V3 Announcement](https://stakewise.medium.com/stakewise-v3-announcement-9e4fe73abdf2).

StakeWise V3 features a liquid staking token, osETH, that any staker can mint to access DeFi. osETH minting is optional and can be done on-demand, for times when a liquid staking token is needed. The liquidity and integrations for osETH are provided by StakeWise DAO, creating a ready-made liquid staking ecosystem for any operator to plug into. The osETH token has in-built slashing protection due to its overcollateralisation and accrues yield from a highly diverse set of node operators. osETH is a new token that is launching with StakeWise V3 and, consequently, there is no historical price data to refer to.

The protocol is governed by StakeWise DAO, a [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) DAO with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.

## Motivation

osETH will be the main LST for StakeWise moving forward and the osETH-ETH Balancer pool will be the primary liquidity venue. A gauge is necessary to help bootstrap the pool’s TVL.

## Specifications

**1. Governance** 
The StakeWise DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token. The majority of the protocol’s smart contracts are immutable (incl. osETH). Contracts that are upgradable require a successful DAO vote followed by the approval of a Vault admin/owner to ensure users of the protocol retain full control over contract upgradeability.

**2. Oracles** 
StakeWise relies on an Oracle network to accurately report validator balances to the protocol smart contracts. StakeWise has 11 leading commercial operators all acting under SLAs to ensure the Network runs efficiently (more information can be found [here](https://docs-v3.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oracles)).

**3. Audits** 
Halborn and Sigma Prime ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits)), alongside a public audit competition hosted by [Hats Finance](https://twitter.com/HatsFinance/status/1712166174459347001).

**4. Centralization vectors**
No, both the StakeWise DAO and the Oracle network are decentralised.

**5. Market History**
None, osETH is a newly deployed token.

### Protocol description

* aGHO is the deposit receipt token issued by the Aave protocol to lenders of GHO. Since aTokens are rebasing, this pool uses BGD Labs’s statA wrapper that is a repricing representation of statA tokens that reflects the accruing lending yield. GHO is issued by [Aave](https://app.aave.com/).
* USDe is a ""delta-neutral synthetic dollar"" issued by [Ethena](https://ethena.fi/).

### Motivation

Gyroscope is launching further strategic pools.

---

### Specifications

#### Governance

The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.

997,1805,4946,4946,4946,2022-10-27 15:02:55+00:00,balancer,"**Summary:**

This is a proposal to enable a Balancer gauge for the tetuQi/Qi StablePool on Polygon.

TetuQi is [Tetu's](https://tetu.io/) liquid-staked derivative token for QiDao's locked $QI staking functionality.

TetuQi holders are entitled to receive the equivalent staking revenue from QiDao as if they had locked their $QI tokens for 4 years, while retaining the ability to sell their tokens by swapping back to $QI.

Currently, TetuQi liquidity is hosted on both TetuSwap and Dystopia, however the community wishes to find a new long-term home for the liquidity pool, as TetuSwap is limited as a Uniswap V2 fork, and Dystopia is struggling to remain established on Polygon.

**References/Useful links:**

- [Tetu Website](https://app.tetu.io/)
- [Documentation for tetuQi](https://docs.tetu.io/tetu-io/protocol/products#tetuqi)

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/xs8VESN4yz)

**Protocol Description:**

From the Tetu docs:

> Tetu is a Web3 asset management protocol built on Polygon that implements automated yield farming strategies to provide investors with a safe and secure method of receiving a high and stable yield on their investments. Tetu's innovative solutions provide automated yield aggregation and distribution through xTETU.
>
> Tetu's development focus is to build a self-sustaining yield management ecosystem that provides stable and attractive yields for users. Tetu aims to make the development of automated and decentralized Yield management solutions the main structure of the protocol.

With regards to TetuQi specifically:

- $QI is the governance token for [QiDao](http://mai.finance/), an established overcollateralized stable coin on Polygon and other networks

- $tetuQi is Tetu's liquid-staked derivative token for QiDao's locked $QI staking functionality.

**Motivation:**

Liquid staking tokens can be at risk of depegging from their base asset when there is not enough incentive to provide swap liquidity. Tetu has been incentivizing these LPs with first $TETU emissions, and then veDYST votes and bribes on Dystopia, but we would like to give the Tetu community option to direct tetuBal votes for this Stable Pool by enabling the gauge and adding it to the [tetuBal reflection votes.](https://snapshot.org/#/tetubal.eth)

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** . Tetu protocol is governed by dxTETU, in this way only dxTETU holders can actively participate in governance decisions and shape the future of the protocol. All Tetu protocol management decisions are carried out through on-chain governance, providing an environment of transparency in the governance process.

2. **Oracles:** TetuQi does not rely on the use of any oracles

3. **Audits:** https://docs.tetu.io/tetu-io/security/audits

4. **Centralization vectors:** n/a

5. **Market History:** TetuQi has recently trended away from a 1:1 peg due to the fact that a large liquidity provider has chosen to remain in the TetuSwap liquidity pool, which uses a traditional ""Uniswap V2"" `x*y=k` price function. However, the peg is slowly returning as Tetu's eQI yields are used to buy tetuQi at a discount, and as the community takes advantage of this fact to buy TetuQi at a discount.

6. **Value:** We expect that if Balancer were to enable the gauge, this pool could become the primary source of liquidity for tetuQi.

**Summary:**

Gains Network (gTrade) is a decentralized perpetual futures trading platform on Arbitrum. Gains Network aims to list a gUSDC/Aave USDC pool, gUSDC benefits from protocol fees on gTrade, while Aave USDC receives borrow yield through Aave. We chose to establish this on Balancer to attract significant liquidity and bolster further integrations within the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem.

**Protocol Description:**
>Gains Network [(gTrade)](https://gains.trade/trading#BTC-USD) is a decentralized perpetual futures trading platform with a robust infrastructure featuring 197 trading pairs with high leverage [up to 150x for crypto, 250x for commodities, and 1000x on forex], deep liquidity, guaranteed order execution, and accurate pricing. Since inception, the protocol has generated $78.3B lifetime volume.
The asset Gains Network would like to list on Balancer is gUSDC paired with Aave USDC. gUSDC is one of the gVault tokens that receives a share of the protocol fees by serving as a counterparty to trader wins & losses.
The history price of gUSDC can be publicly viewed on our dune dashboard linked above. It has generally been an “up-only” asset with the exception of a few dips shortly after the launch of the asset back in January.
The historical price of gUSDC can be found here: https://dune.com/queries/3385617/5681244
And, here: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gains-network-usdc

>**Motivation:**
Gains Network aims to enable a gauge for a gUSDC / Aave USDC pool to significantly increase the liquidity for gUSDC on secondary markets by pairing this with a highly capital efficient asset like Aave USDC. This will set the foundation for more integrations with the purpose of expanding gUSDC utility across Arbitrum DeFi.
It's great to pair gUSDC with Aave USDC because this increases the overall yield in the pool and increases the attractiveness of the entire pool from an LP perspective. Furthermore, an E-CLP pool allows you to  build a curve that specifically suits gUSDC and the related price volatility.  


>**Specifications:**
Gains Network will utilize a part of its STIP.B LP incentives budget to bootstrap more (sticky) liquidity for the [gUSDC](https://gains.trade/vaults/gUSDC) vault as it anticipates more USDC-collateral usage on gTrade over the coming months. Initially, the focus will be on building liquidity on partner DEXs for gUSDC pools, including this Balancer pool. This strategy aims to unlock various partnership opportunities, creating an ecosystem around gUSDC through lending markets, LP-strategy protocols, and more.
Gains Network is seeking to co-incentivize this pool with Balancer to establish the required liquidity as a foundation for said gUSDC integrations and consecutively form a long-term partnership with Balancer as one of the main venues for gUSDC since Gains Network believes Balancer’s pool designs can be largely be maintained beyond STIP.B incentives through swapping fees & incentives post the bootstrapping phase. 

1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.
   
The incentives distributor is governed by the following Multisig address: [0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D
](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D)And, Gains Network is actively working towards being a DAO governed through the $GNS token.

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

gTrade leverages their own custom-built Chainlink decentralized oracle network (DON) to provide real-time, aggregated prices for their leveraged trading products. The oracle architecture uses a custom DON to supply on-demand prices to an aggregator contract while the official Chainlink Price Feeds serve as anchors, meaning if their price differs by more than 1.5% from Chainlink Price Feeds, a circuit breaker is triggered.

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

Audits are conducted with each upgrade Gains Network undergoes. With the release of [V8 in May](https://medium.com/gains-network/introducing-gtrade-v8-diamond-refactor-and-smart-contract-integration-a175b96ccb82), the entire codebase has been audited. Moreover, the release of [V9](https://x.com/GainsNetwork_io/status/1807877092836610406) [current version] has been audited as well.

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

We will state our centralization vectors by giving insights into our most centralized facet: the DON. The current custom decentralized oracle network is operated by 8 independent chainlink node operators & 1 price feed from StorkOracle.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

A Balancer has been set up for gUSDC/USDC. This has been running since July 12th where TVL went up to $1.12M and has since come down to around $500K .

https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0xe8a6026365254f779b6927f00f8724ea1b8ae5e0000000000000000000000580

The gUSDC asset is tradeable on a Ramses CL pool as per June 15th and started to get incentivized with $ARB from June 27th onwards. The pool is currently sitting at $520K TVL and can be found here: https://ramses.exchange/liquidity/v2/0xe9e3ef12f1f9dbaf7b7f57ab262c54117448884b

Recently, a Camelot pool went live on the 5th of August. The TVL currently sits at: $1.04M

https://app.camelot.exchange/pools/0x1470b62eB67225f6EcDF8249293C8052f1cd2717

The new pool that we’re looking to incentivize is:

[https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x69d9bc07a19caad9ae4ca40af18d5a688839a29900020000000000000000058e
](https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x69d9bc07a19caad9ae4ca40af18d5a688839a29900020000000000000000058e)

Since the inception of this secondary market pool, Gains Network vaults have been consistently overcollateralized while the gUSDC asset has never been below peg and has not experienced significant volatility. Considering the ‘up-only’ nature of gTokens and gUSDC currently sitting at a 107.88% collateralization ratio, the price of gUSDC is expected to continue its upwards price action as time passes.
 
6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) 

The pool will not serve as the primary source of liquidity in the bootstrapping phase, but will be leveraged as the primary source of liquidity once the bootstrapping phase has passed. 
The pool can generate consistent fees due to gUSDC depositors only being able to use Balancer as a means of exiting before our epoch system, looping through lending markets & liquidations through lending markets.

The pool can generate consistent fees due to gUSDC depositors using Balancer as a means to exit before utilizing other lending markets and liquidations through those markets.

5. **Value:** The expected value add to Balancer includes generating consistent fees from the gUSDC depositors who will only be able to use Balancer for exiting before using other lending markets or undergoing liquidation through those markets.

6. **Child Chain Gauge and Mainnet Root Gauge:** The Child Chain Gauge is located at https://arbiscan.io/address/0xdDbDca6213b4a03d8C6fC1419Ef7B0b16B61d363, and the Mainnet Root Gauge can be found at https://etherscan.io/address/0x86893f6829dA1296F739F50Ff9d3923453E9b48D

7. **Technical Specification:** The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 and call the `addGauge` function, passing in the gauge address (0x86893f6829dA1296F739F50Ff9d3923453E9b48D) and gauge type (Arbitrum).",bullish,medium

## Summary:

Proposal to add gauge support for the newly created Radiant 80/20 RDNT/WETH pool which is currently the largest liquidity pool on Balancer Arbitrum.

The Radiant Capital DAO, a week into its v2 launch on Arbitrum and days from adding its second chain (BNB chain) to become DeFi’s 1st omnichain money market, has approved and implemented a Balancer 80/20 RDNT/WETH pool as its primary liquidity hub on Arbitrum via DAO governance[ RFP-3.](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x6d1af397fd5ca984694b29616364885620985980b21177991ddfa6c9a08c5940)

With v2, the DAO has fully aligned its tokenomics for activities that are compatible with the DAO’s collective-benefit ethos and a long-termism mindset. The results of this new Balancer pool have exceeded all expectations, and its first week’s volume was greater than all Arbitrum pools combined. To leverage this successful position further, the DAO is optimistically establishing this gauge and proposing to enable BAL emissions.

## Protocol Description:

Radiant aims to be the first omnichain money market where users can deposit any major asset on any major chain and borrow various supported assets across multiple chains.

The Radiant DAO's primary goal is to consolidate the ~$20 billion of fragmented liquidity (lending TVL) dispersed across the top ten alternative layers (source:[ DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocols/lending)).

Lenders who provide liquidity to Radiant are interacting and providing utility to the platform. In addition, lenders can capture the added value from the communities’ engagement through the native token $RDNT.

Borrowers can withdraw against collateralized assets to obtain liquidity (working capital) without selling their assets and closing their positions.

## Motivation:

The Radiant DAO aims to be the most fee-earning & omnichain protocol in crypto whilst ushering in the next 100m of new DeFi users. Adding this gauge to the robust[ Dynamic liquidity](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x058ea8db46ec92bfec2a36691aba75f671f04e99c6ffa7141768e3760d8bf584) vault (current liquidity is 30+m within its first week) represents another step in strengthening the relationship between the two protocols. In addition, this pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity on the rapidly growing Arbitrum chain.



## Details:

1. Governance: The Radiant DAO governance model can be found here: https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/governance/proposal-process.

2. Oracles: Radiant price feeds are secured by[ Chainlink oracles](https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/contracts-and-security/contracts).

3. Omnichain: The RDNT token in v2 is an omnifungible (OFT-20) token and the v2 dApp provides users with an innovative borrow & bridge function via Layer0’s stargate stable router interface.

4. Audits: While Radiant v2 is primarily composed of the same codebase as Radiant v1 — the Radiant DAO takes safety & security seriously and tripled down on audits.

We did multiple top-to-bottom v2 audits with[ Peckshield](https://docsend.com/view/4irymmv5uifge3tr) and[ Zokyo](https://docsend.com/view/vcux2vysnzcehq9b), with zero unresolved critical or high issues.[ BlockSec](https://blocksec.com/) was also hired for white hat hacking with zero unresolved issues.

5. Centralization vectors:

   1. The Radiant DAO asserts that the network's governance, development, or usage is not centralized 
   and progressively gets more decentralized as the number of RDNT token holders grows. Together 
   with Fenwick, Radiant set up the Radiant DAO governance portal (dao.radiant.capital) and ratified 
   the first two governance proposals, RFP-1, and RFP-2, on which RDNT token holders voted.

   2. The Radiant DAO Constitution includes a very clear process for the community to discuss, 
   propose, and vote on new measures, regardless of whether the team ceases to exist. This includes 
   technical changes, improvements, bug fixes, protocol changes (emissions, allocation points), or 
   other protocol improvements. The establishment of the DAO formalizes this, as well as voting power 
   through RDNT liquidity tokens.

   3. The smart contracts are verified, and any community member may propose changes or 
   improvements. Several community members who are not affiliated with the project at launch have 
   been brought on as “core contributors” in developing smart contract improvements and helping 
   manage portions of the Radiant community.

   4. Because Radiant was built on a similar framework to Aave and Geist, many of the core contracts 
   are upgradable by the owner. To mitigate security concerns and foster transparency, all Radiant 
   smart contracts are placed behind a[ timelock](https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/contracts-and- 
   security/security-timelock), with a two-day delay for any action. The Radiant team has no intentions 
   to ever push upgrades to these contracts except to address a critical vulnerability. We will 
   prominently inform the community prior to any admin-related actions involving the timelock and 
   encourage community members to monitor inbound transactions to the timelock address. The 
   Radiant team will always announce all admin-related actions prior to queuing them in the timelock

   5. 48,000 unique wallets have interacted with the protocol. Administrative functions within the smart 
   contracts are under timelock and Gnosis multisig. The committee that manages that multisig was 
   ratified as part of Radiant DAO’s first proposal,[ RFP-1] 
 (https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0xffe6588f96159f052ea6ccb9c683a971b6a4fa8b2532f0d0755504be72fdeb6f).

6. Market History: Radiant fair launched on 7/24/2022 and was self-funded with no VCs. Radiant v1 became the top lending protocol on Arbitrum with 148.45m TVL before the transition to v2.

7. Value: This pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for Radiant on Arbitrum. In addition, the Radiant DAO sees the value of this gauge in alignment with other protocols in the ecosystem and sees potential and value in doing so with Balancer.

## Specifications 
### Gauge Weight Cap
The RDNT v2 token and pool is quite new.  Based on it's mcap, weighting and fee contributions, it sits just on the boarder of the [Capped Gauge Framework](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-57-introduce-gauge-framework-v1/3604), sitting currently slightly over the limit allowing for an uncapped gauge based on high trading fees.   The current intention of this pool is to allow collected fees to be paid back in to the gauge via Core Pool Bribes.  

A Gauge capped at 10% provides more than enough room for these activities for the foreseeable future.  In order to alleviate any concerns around RDNT being used in an ""capture most of the pool and over-vote for it"" scheme, a voluntary 10% cap has been placed on the gauge.   Radiant may return to governance at a later date to request an increase as the need arises and the pool has more history to be used to evaluate it against BIP-57.

### Gauge Type
Note that this gauge is a traditional gauge, not a single recipient gauge used as part of the ve80/20 program.  As a result BAL incentives will be paid out to addresses depositing tokens in the Balancer Gauge.  Not to a single smart contract that redirects these tokens to lockers.

### Core Pools Designation:
While this pool contains no boosted tokens, a 0.5% fee has been set on the pool with an intention to participate in the [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) boosted pool program.  As with RBN/USDC gauge, It is therefore requested that 100% of the fees earned by this pool and not paid to the DAO are used to pay bribes on the pool.   It is further requested that these fees are used bribe the RDNT/WETH pool directly, instead of participating in the distribution of bribes by TVL as following the protocol for mainnet instead of for side-chains specified in BIP-19.  Handling of this pool should change in line with changes to BIP-19.

### Details of Gauge to be whitelisted

The gauge is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for Radiant on Arbitrum and aligns with other protocols in the ecosystem.

The Gauge Weight Cap is set at 10%, providing enough room for activities such as fee redistribution via Core Pool Bribes. A voluntary 10% cap has been placed on the gauge to prevent any concerns about manipulation. The gauge type is traditional, not a single recipient gauge used in the ve80/20 program, and BAL incentives will be paid out directly to addresses depositing tokens in the Balancer Gauge.

The pool contains no boosted tokens but has a 0.5% fee set with the intention of participating in the BIP-19 boosted pool program.

**Summary**

Restore brand trust in Balancer by assisting DNS hack users, allowing them to immediately recover 75% of lost funds, while Balancer continues to investigate this incident.  Users claiming immediate restitution shall forfeit all further claims relating to this incident, with any further recovery accruing to the Balancer DAO.

**Background**

On September 19, the Balancer frontend was attacked via social engineering on EuroDNS, the domain register used for .fi TLDs.

https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1704281611326357567

Due to prompt action from community members, damage was mitigated, and control was quickly restored.

https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1705250633782313431

https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1704552285395894422

Unfortunately, users interacting with the Balancer frontend while the attack was ongoing were affected.  Final damage numbers have not been published.  However, rough estimates would be around 200-300K USD.

**Motivation**

Brand trust is the public's perception of a brand's reliability and trustworthiness, as informed by both personal experience and marketing communication. It’s a complex concept that encompasses a variety of factors, including security and privacy, product quality, customer service, brand mission and values, and political or philanthropic efforts.  In crypto, brand trust is an important, and arguably the most vital, differentiator between comparable products in competitive market conditions.

Brand trust is a critical component of brand loyalty. Customers who trust a brand are more likely to utilize it again, even if they have a negative experience from time to time or one-off experiences that don't meet their expectations.

Consistency is another strong component of successful branding.  Communicating the same values in the same voice at every customer touchpoint--treating all users alike--is important in creating an authentic brand.  Inconsistent actions are unpredictable, and unpredictability dissuades consumers.

[[BIP-XXX] Decide on direction of restitution for affected LPs in Boosted Pool Incident](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-decide-on-direction-of-restitution-for-affected-lps-in-boosted-pool-incident/5187) is an excellent example of striving to restore brand trust.  While Balancer is neither obligated to provide restitution, nor responsible for user actions, the community has nonetheless found it worthwhile to seek a resolution to the first hack and make its users whole.

Similar, Balancer should attempt to take any possible actions within its power to mitigate harm caused by the second hack as well to known, affected users.  We propose that verified actors affected by the DNS hack be allowed to claim 75% of their lost funds from Balancer while it continues to investigate this incident, forfeiting further claims to their lost funds, with any additional funds recovered going to the Balancer DAO.  By doing so, Balancer will be not only be able to restore, but grow its brand trust, which will be essential if it seeks to succeed in the long term.  In today's competitive marketplace, users have more choices than ever before, and are increasingly demanding, especially with consumer security and safety. Consumers want to interact with brands, like Balancer, that can provide a safe transactional environment and positive overall experience.

**Specification**

Upon approval of this BIP, immediately send $117,806.25 USDC (72.0528468675 ETH) to address 0xD14f076044414C255D2E82cceB1CB00fb1bBA64c, a verified, known, damaged wallet, who will be providing an on-chain signature for wallet verification referencing this BIP in the comments below, along with a statement forgoing all further claims to restitution.  The amount to be sent is 75% of the $157,075 USD (96.07046249 ETH) total lost by this wallet during the attack period across 5 transactions, which can be verified on chain [here](https://etherscan.io/address/auramaxi.eth).

Further:

1.The max budget for this program shall be 350K USD.
2. A 60 day reporting window shall by announced via appropriate channels, including Discord and Twitter, following approval of this BIP, with a second reminder at 30 days, and a final reminder in the final week to deadline.  The 60 day claim period will start upon announcement of the claim window.
3. To submit claims, users will [verify wallet ownership](https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures) and report any DNS hack losses via a Google Form, which shall be prepared by a volunteer committee of 5 well-qualified, objective individuals with experience in DeFi opsec, who shall serve as a technical advisory committee to process these transactions.  Because a widely used angel drainer was used in this attack, it's not possible to determine whether tokens drained during the timeframe of the attack were from user interactions with the Balancer FE or from elsewhere.  Some blockers can be put in place to prevent potential double-dipping from the attacker himself, such as gathering identifying information on the claim form.  But ultimately, whether a user making a claim was truly affected will come down to a human call.  If the committee reviews a claim, finds it satisfactory, submits a BIP, and governance approves that BIP, then that claim is legitimized.
4. To validate and approve claims, the committee will verify the address and transaction details on Etherscan, arriving at an independent total to be compared against details submitted on the Google Form.  Should the details match, the claim shall be recommended for processing.  Should the details conflict, the claim will be rejected for resubmission.
5. To execute, the committee will aggregate all claims in batches, and prepare two BIPs to be approved by governance--one BIP to be submitted 30 days after the start of the 60 day claim period announcement, the second BIP to be submitted at the 60 day deadline.  Each BIP shall include a list of affected wallet addresses and amounts, and be sent to the Balancer DAO signers on the following Tuesday after each BIP has been approved, who shall use transaction builder to execute one multi-send transaction to send the verified amounts to the affected wallets.
6. Further claims following the 60 day period will require a new BIP and must go through governance.

**Voting**

To ensure the effectiveness of public relations campaigns, immediate action is necessary.  Consequently, we’d respectfully request that this BIP be moved to vote this week.

**Summary:**

> This pool uses the ComposableStablePoolFactory-v3 1 which addresses the [reentrancy vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345) disclosed during February 2023. This gauge is uncapped, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329). This means 65% of 50% of yield generated by this pool is to be used for bribing for votes on it via [Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/balancer). The remaining 35% goes to Balancer DAO as revenue. 
> 
> The pool wstETH/bb-a-wETH is to replace the [wstETH/wETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x36bf227d6bac96e2ab1ebb5492ecec69c691943f000200000000000000000316) pool on Arbitrum.

Laguna Games requests the whitelisting of the Laguna Games Gnosis Safe, enabling it to lock veBAL and participate in governance and gauge voting activities.

## Motivation
Laguna Games is a game development company responsible for building the [Crypto Unicorns](https://www.cryptounicorns.fun/) game. Crypto Unicorns’ RBW is the primary token value used both for in-game operations, in-game marketplace and governance. Laguna Games recognizes Balancer as a long-term partner, with our [official RBW/wETH liquidity pool](https://polygon.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x8f9dd2064eb38e8e40f2ab67bde27c0e16ea9b080002000000000000000004ca) resting on Balancer. We hope that with this, we’d be able to further align with the Balancer ecosystem through active participation in governance and by incentivizing additional liquidity flow via Balancer.

## Specification
We are requesting to whitelist the Laguna Games Gnosis Safe multisig so it may interact with the veBAL contract.

**Summary:**
> In the wake of layer zero permitting cross chain boosting to veBAL gauges and the potential launch of Aura on Optimism, it makes sense to move forward with activating gauges on the network for pools which are driving revenue there. This proposal aims to turn on gauges for four weighted pools:
> - [Happy Road](https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x39965c9dab5448482cf7e002f583c812ceb53046000100000000000000000003) (40WETH-40OP-20USDC) - uncapped

**Protocol Description:**

> wstETH is Lido's liquid staking derivative of ethereum. USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. 

> OATH is the governance token of the OATH ecosystem and notably Ethos Reserve. It can be paired with ETH to create Bonded Oath, or $bOATH. Bonded Oath can be staked by users to earn yield from the protocol and facilitate trading of the OATH token on the Beethoven-X platform.

>Ethos Reserve is a **decentralized lending protocol** that allows users to take out **interest-free loans** against collateral such as **BTC** and **ETH** . Loans on Ethos Reserve are paid in **Ethos Reserve Notes** , or **ERN** , which is a stable asset pegged to the US Dollar.

> Sonne is relevant here as it acts as a boosting protocol for the linear pools present in the Sonne-tricrypto pool. It is a fork of compound. 

**Motivation:**

> These pools are major contributors to the revenue of Balancer & Beets on Optimism. Happy Road and Tri-Sonnes act as primary liquidity for trade routes, while ERN and OATH pool gauges are supportive of the OATH ecosystem which brings in respectable TVL and volume. 

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Links to governance forums and documentation of protocols encompassed in this proposal can be seen above. OATH is the governance token for both OATH and ERN, SONNE for Sonne Finance, and USDC is the only token without governance as it belongs to circle.  

2. **Oracles:** No rate providers are present here aside from the linear pools referencing their own getRate functions. 

3. **Audits:** Ern Audits can be seen [here](https://docs.ethos.finance/security/audits). 

4. **Centralization vectors:** The only centralization vector of note in the protocols within these pools is the fact that Circle issues USDC without 

5. **Market History:** Market history of each BPT can be seen on each pool's page above provided by BeethovenX.

6. **Value:** The pools will be the initial and core drivers of liquidity of Optimism for the time being. Boosted pools, and projects looking to expand on the network will be able to capitalize on the path these pools pave forward for the Balancer ecosystem. Mainly, revenue, volume, and TVL will increase by incetizing these pairings. 

**Transaction Specification**

The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:

The loans are issued in the form of Ethos Reserve Notes (ERN), a stable asset pegged to the US Dollar.

The platform also includes Sonne, a boosting protocol for linear pools within the Sonne-tricrypto pool, which is a fork of Compound. These pools contribute significantly to the revenue of Balancer & Beets on Optimism and provide primary liquidity for trade routes.

Governance for this platform is handled by OATH (for both OATH and ERN), SONNE for Sonne Finance, and USDC, which does not have governance as it belongs to Circle. The only centralization vector in the protocols within these pools is the issuance of USDC by Circle.

The platform's value comes from its role as a core driver of liquidity on Optimism, particularly for projects looking to expand on the network. This is achieved by incentivizing these pairings, leading to increased revenue, volume, and TVL (Total Value Locked).

In terms of transactions, the Balancer Maxi LM Multisig will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` and call the addGauge function with specific arguments for each pool: Happy Road, Proof of Reserves, Bonded Oath Token, and Tri-SONNE Harmonic Crescendo.",bullish,small

**Summary:**

> This pool uses the metastable pool factory, which allows the protocol fee on yield to be taken, even with the recent potential issue raised for CSPs. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. The fees collected on Optimism are subject to the agreement between BEETs and Balancer, where fees will be handled according to the terms [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-deploy-balancer-to-optimism-managed-by-beethovenx/3072); these are subject to change in later proposals.

**Protocol Description:**

> wstETH is liquid staked ETH. WETH is wrapped Ether.

**Motivation:**

> Balancer’s strategic objectives is to attract more yield bearing liquidity. wstETH has been on Optimism, but incentivizing it through a gauge presents an opportunity to deepen Balancer / Beets liquidity and become the main liquidity destination for wstETH. Adding this wstETH/weth pool will allow the rest of our wstETH liquidity to interact and arbitrage with other weth liquidity on Optimsim. The goal moving forward is center most of Balancer’s liquidity around wstETH and other yield bearing tokens, so this pool will act as a primary route for trades to move through.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** Find more information about governance on Lido’s [forum](https://research.lido.fi/).
2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on a chain link rate provider, with no write functions, for wstETH deployed [here ](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9aa3cd420f830E049e2b223D0b07D8c809C94d15#readContract).
3. **Audits:** See [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits).
4. **Centralization vectors:** See [here ](https://lido.fi/faq) for information on this.
5. **Market History:** See here.
6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on wstETH yield. Until the CSP protocol fee is sorted out, this is the best option. In the interim we need to position Balancer as the primary liquidity destination for wstETH. This pool isn’t the ideal configuration due to no pairing with bbaWETH, lack of altering the A factor and fixed swap fees.

1006,1820,5002,5002,5002,2022-03-18 15:03:29+00:00,balancer,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/hexagon-friendly-fork-proposal/2613).

**Background**

The Friendly Fork model (aka Franchise model) was first introduced by @followthechain in this [post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-on-other-chains-friendly-forks-aka-franchise-model/2279).

The general reasoning behind the proposal was to make the Balancer technology available on chains where Balancer.fi was not present and to avoid an increase in workload by the Balancer Labs core team.

The FF model, at the moment, has only been applied on one occasion with the approval of [Beethovenx](https://beets.fi/#/) through this [snapshot vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x95db8e797145ad590b467f8dbecb23404c25c2a7090aa8a8d65428ad9f7373fc).

The extraordinary [success](https://twitter.com/beethoven_x/status/1503647503698247680) that ""Beets"" has achieved to date, has created an appetite for the recreation of a similar model that could use the same superior technology (the Balancer technology), but with a different, own identity adapted to the market intended to enter.

**Motivation**

Current market conditions show a consistent increase in trading activity on Avalanche, which has demonstrated to be one of the most active and vibrant communities in the DeFi landscape. The strategic decision of the Balancer team not to deploy on this chain has pushed the Partnership subDAO towards the exploration of possible valid alternatives with the intention of recreating, at least partially, the success of BeethovenX.

Launching a Friendly Fork by the DAO however, proved to be a complex exercise with mainly three factors that strongly influenced the decision making process:

1. Team: finding a team that is able to develop, maintain and dedicate resources to the project;
2. Chain: current market conditions present two options:
--> develop a product on a highly competitive and possibly saturated chain or
--> be a first mover on ""nascent"" chains with the associated risk of not being relevant and wasting resources;

3. Liquidity: how to bootstrap decent liquidity from day one (critical factor).

To minimise these risks, the Partnership subDAO believed in the creation of a “hub”, by deeply concentrating synergies with experienced players in the DeFi ecosystem and building a joint project.

**Introducing Hexagon Finance**

Hexagon will be a multi-functional platform, with the intention of intercepting the different needs of the Avalanche crypto Community by bringing a new decentralized exchange, a launch-pad and a lending platform.

*Ava Labs blessing*: A critical role has been played by Ava Labs which has operated as an important bridge between the later to be named Hexagon team and BalancerDAO.

Moreover, Avalabs has committed some initial funds specifically dedicated to the Liquidity Mining program. This will help for the bootstrapping of liquidity and attracting fresh capital from competing chains.

*Terra Labs Partnership*: Hexagon Finance will be mainly focused on UST, the algo stable coin of Terra, with the ultimate goal of making it the most used and widely distributed stable-coin on Avalanche.

TerraLabs will join the project by being a major stakeholder together with BalancerDAO and the founding team. Terralabs has committed for an initial capital deployment (UST) to help the project building the initial phase of liquidity bootstrapping.

The launchpad functionality will be developed by Copperlaunch, a long term partner of Balancer.

**Specification**

The agreement between Hexagon Finance and BalancerDAO has been built around a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which will be signed by a BalancerDAO representative if this proposal is accepted.

General conditions are the following:
BalancerDAO is requesting the following

*1. Governance*

* The community on the host chain fully supports the fork development;
* Teams should adhere to a level of code of conduct that is in line with the core values of the Balancer community.

*2. Technical*

*   1. Balancer V2 core contracts should be deployed without any changes, (Contracts deployed 1:1)
*   2. No migration functionality in the MasterChef;
*   3. All controllable protocol parameters need to be managed by reputable multisig.

*3. Financial*

Hexagon Finance undertakes to provide Balancer with as many tokens as the Hexagon team. Tokens will be received under the same conditions in terms of vesting and release. This means 6% of the total supply, or 6 million tokens out of 100,000,000, whose release will be locked for 6 months upon launch and linearly vested for 12 to 24 months. The exact length of time will be finalized upon the completion of the private sale round, if any.

The tokens will be claimable using an address chosen by Balancer.

In exchange for the above conditions, Hexagon requires Balancer to engage mainly in Marketing activities and awareness campaigns as detailed below:

* Tweeting original content about Hexagon Finance for the four weeks prior to our launch and for the two months following it. The tweet will come from the BalancerDAO handle.

* Creating and publishing announcements regarding the activities of Hexagon Finance. This will cover every major activity such as, but not limited to, airdrops, launches, new pools being created and products being launched.

* Organizing Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions with the Balancer community to promote the launch of Hexagon and eventual upgrades/news afterward. At a minimum, this will include an AMA shortly before or after the launch of the Hexagon Dex.

* Hexagon Finance is authorized to use the name and logo of Balancer in its official documents in statements with pre-approval on logo usage from BalancerDAO such as “the officially approved fork of Balancer on Avalanche” and similar;

* Providing statements from official representatives of BalancerDAO in support of Hexagon to influencers, media outlets, and similar. This will include both written and audio statements as required by the channel used (articles, video, podcasts etc.). At least one statement should be shared before the launch of the platform.

* In general, making it clear to the Balancer community that Hexagon is an officially approved fork of the Balancer Protocol on Avalanche.

**Tokenomics**

Token allocation will be distributed as follow:
|18%|Team - BalancerDAO - Terra Labs|
| --- | --- |
|5%|Strategy investors|
|2%|Liquidity bootstrapping|
|10%|Marketing|
|10%|Partners and Advisors|
|55%|Liquidity Mining incentives|

**SWOT Analysis**

*Strengths*

The Partnership subDAO believes that the blessing of Avalabs, the partnership with Terralabs and the reliability of the funding team are the main points of strength. The Avalanche ecosystem is already highly competitive so risk mitigations strategies have been considered necessary for the development of Hexagon Finance;

*Weaknesses*

* Making UST as the main focal point can be a double edged sword for two reasons:

1. focussing on one stable coin creates an overexposure that some would consider unnecessary in terms of point of failure;
2. the general missing of potential trading volume on alternative pairs.

* While the BeethovenX Friendly Fork agreement has been reached after launch, in this case, the agreement should be reached before. Consequently bringing a certain level of uncertainty. However, the Partnership subDAO believes that risks have been reduced considerably given the deep due diligence done on the team and the partners involved in this collaboration.

The DeFi landscape is still in its early stages and layers of uncertainty are very much present, especially in today’s market conditions. A constantly evolving market generates certain known unknowns and a level of unpredictability that needs to be taken into account when operating in cutting edge environments.

*Opportunities*

The BalancerDAO will finally have the opportunity to have a stake in a project with strong backing, good fundamentals and exposure to a strategic chain. This is, today, the best opportunity we see for a successful Balancer powered Dex on Avalanche.

*Threats*

Competition is high! Even if Hexagon would focus mainly on UST trading pairs, more established and long term native players still control the vast majority of the market.

Conclusion

We present this as a great opportunity to the Balancer Community. Hexagon will ultimately increase the number of independent teams working and using the Balancer technology. This project will also increase the number of developers working on the protocol, give precious feedback to the Balancer core team and ultimately, inspire us all to do better. Similar to what Beethoven has been doing during the past few months.

I hope this presentation gives you enough context to where we have been, where we are, and where we want to go: up only.

*For full disclosure:*
*The Hexagon team has offered Andrea a token allocation equal to the 0,0012% of the total token supply as a thank you gesture.*",bullish,11.85,2022-03-18 15:03:29+00:00,12.86,12.86,2022-03-19 00:00:00+00:00,8.52320675105485,12.1,0.0210970464135021,0.8447067439556122,True," In summary, the finalized agreement between Hexagon and BalancerDAO involves Balancer providing marketing support for Hexagon Finance in exchange for tokens. The marketing activities include tweeting about Hexagon, creating announcements, organizing AMA sessions, using the Balancer name and logo with pre-approval, and providing statements of support to influencers, media outlets, and similar channels.

The token allocation is distributed as follows: 18% to Team - BalancerDAO - Terra Labs, 5% to Strategy investors, 2% to Liquidity bootstrapping, 10% to Marketing, 10% to Partners and Advisors, and 55% to Liquidity Mining incentives.

The SWOT Analysis highlights the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with this partnership. The strengths include the partnership with Avalabs, Terralabs, and the reliability of the funding team. The weaknesses include the potential overexposure to UST as a stablecoin and the uncertainty surrounding the BeethovenX Friendly Fork agreement.

The opportunities lie in having a stake in a project with strong backing and exposure to the Avalanche ecosystem. However, competition is high due to established players controlling the majority of the market. Despite these challenges, Hexagon presents a great opportunity for the Balancer community to increase the number of independent teams using Balancer technology, inspire development on the protocol, and ultimately contribute to its growth.

# Introduction

The recent [issue involving double-entrypoint tokens](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/medium-severity-bug-found/3161), which includes SNX and sBTC, saw those tokens being transferred out of the Vault into the ProtocolFeeCollector. The multisig in charge of managing protocol fees [renounced the permission](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x62faf47ff5401dc7658b37344efd0800aa88ba34cf5c38c061e4487e4aaddaac) to withdraw them, meaning these user funds are now solely controlled by the Balancer Governance multisig. Until the situation is resolved however, regular protocol fee withdrawal and distribution (including revenue for veBAL holders) is halted.

This proposal provides a mechanism to continue with protocol fee distribution while keeping SNX and sBTC from LPs safe.

# Specification

We've developed a contract called [ProtocolFeesWithdrawer](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ef4c5352882b10893b70DbcaA0C000965bd23c5), which forwards requests to withdraw tokens to the ProtocolFeesCollector, as long as the tokens are not included in a 'denylist' of tokens that cannot be withdrawn. This list can be updated by Balancer Governance.

By granting permission to the ProtocolFeesWithdrawer to withdraw from Collector, and to the [original Safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7c68c42de679ffb0f16216154c996c354cf1161b) to initiate withdrawals on the Withdrawer, the multisig will regain the ability to manage protocol fees, but will be unable to withdraw any SNX or sBTC.

I propose we make the Withdrawer part of our permanent infrastructure, since it adds very little overhead and allows for measures like this one to be taken. This is not the first instance we've seen of tokens incorrectly landing in the ProtocolFeeCollector, and we might want to make use of these capabilities again in the future.

### Execution details
Call `grantRolesToMany` on the [Authorizer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa331d84ec860bf466b4cdccfb4ac09a1b43f3ae6), with:
* roles: `[0xb2b6e48fa160a7c887d9d7a68b6a9bb9d47d4953d33e07f3a39e175d75e97796, 0x826ac7ce861f2a54e071e6c724653757fdd1259804eb1ca7f040aa1cd09923fe]`
* accounts: `[0x5ef4c5352882b10893b70DbcaA0C000965bd23c5, 0x7c68c42de679ffb0f16216154c996c354cf1161b]`

This will grant role 0xb2b6...3ae6, which allows withdrawing from the FeeCollector (the same role renounced by the multisig) to the FeeWithdrawer. The address of the Withdrawer can be obtained from the [Balancer Labs deployments repository](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220517-protocol-fee-withdrawer/output/mainnet.json).

The second role granted is 0x826a...23fe, which allows withdrawing from the Withdrawer to the original multisig at 0x7c68...161b. The role can be obtained by [calling `getActionId` on the Withdrawer](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ef4c5352882b10893b70DbcaA0C000965bd23c5#readContract) with 0x6daefab6, the selector of the `withdrawCollectedFees(address[],uint256[],address)` (i.e. the [first eight bytes of that hash](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html).

# Risks

The ProtocolFeesWithdrawer is intentionally extremely simple to minimize smart contract risk. Its mitigations risk being uneffective in the case of double-entrypoint tokens if one of the entrypoints is updated before it can be added to the denylist - we've made the Synthetix team aware of this and they'll report about any changes in advance.

Plans to fix the SNX and sBTC issue are unaffected by this, as we can always grant permission to withdraw them from the Collector to another contract down the line.",bullish,7.71,2022-05-20 15:30:40+00:00,8.12,8.12,2022-05-22 00:00:00+00:00,5.31776913099869,7.82,0.0142671854734111,0.8861334025859833,True," The text discusses a proposal to address an issue where certain tokens were transferred into the ProtocolFeeCollector due to a double-entrypoint token problem.

The proposed solution is to introduce a contract called ProtocolFeesWithdrawer that can manage protocol fees while keeping SNX and sBTC from LPs safe. The multisig will regain the ability to manage protocol fees but won't be able to withdraw SNX or sBCT. The proposal suggests making this contract part of permanent infrastructure due to its minimal overhead and potential future use. The execution details involve granting roles to the ProtocolFeesWithdrawer and the original Safe, with risks being minimized by the simplicity of the contract and awareness from Synthetix team about any changes in double-entrypoint tokens.",bullish,small

**Summary:**
> This pool uses the new weighted pool factory which allows us to apply the protocol fee to yield bearing tokens. This gauge would enter as a ""core pool"" under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.

1010,1826,5009,5009,5009,2023-10-19 08:50:27+00:00,balancer,"## TL;DR:

* Automation for core pool incentives. See code  [here](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/blob/main/fee_allocator/notebooks/pool_fees_and_accounting.ipynb) and results from last round [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16axBQBVNdPssQyjcIyb_4m4vOb5rKISIlrVMk7A2qjs/edit#gid=53204006).
* Reduction of threshold to receive voting incentives for an epoch from $5000 in accumulated fees to <$1000.
* Equal handling of incentive disbursements for Mainnet and L2s
  * Core Pool incentives always flow to the pools that generated the fee, no handling by TVL.
 * Mainnet pays 50% of protocol fees to core pools independent of the pool fee  source which results in a 20% increased fee flow to core pool voters

## Motivation

[The Core Pools program](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) was first initiated in July 2022. The original proposal underwent many iterations, making it less and less reproducible. As more chains have been added, the current system has too many moving parts and manual touch-points to maintain well. This BIP seeks to consolidate learnings and the current state of the incentive program, while simultaneously introducing a new automated system for handling fee redirection.

## History and Context

The Core Pools program fundamentally specifies that certain pools would have the portion of protocol fees due to veBAL holders being redirected as vote incentives. By incentivizing voters for voting on such pools through the fees generated, the proposal aligned short-term incentives with the sustainability of the protocol, creating a flywheel fueled by incentives for veBAL holders to direct BAL emissions to the most lucrative pools on Balancer.

The designation of Core Pools has generally been defined in various governance matters and through ongoing operations as pools that have at least 50% of their allocations containing yield assets with rate providers and paying protocol fees. Additionally, a number of pools have been explicitly added to the list by governance.

The degree to which fees have been directed has varied but as of [BIP-371](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-371-adjust-protocol-fee-split/4978) they stand such that L1 Core Pools & L2’s pay 50% of their collected protocol fees to support Core Pools on the chain they originate from. In the case of L1’s this has always been paid to the pool that generated the fees. In the case of L2’s various strategies were used, but often much of the available voting incentives have been allocated based on the relative TVL of the pools in each chain.

As the calculation of core pool voting incentives has so far been a manual process completed on a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xwUPpbYq7woVOU9vQ8EB8MY75I-1mauTLyDVwvKUDKo/edit#gid=0), the addition of “whitelisting” pools has been done by the Balancer Maxi’s prompted by a mixture of biz dev conversation and discovering new pools that were generating large enough fee-flows to work within the program.

Related to this manual calculation, the Core Pools program has so far not worked well for smaller pools. Currently, fees are only swept from pools if they amount to more than $5,000 USD. As a result, pools that generate under 5k USD per 2 week fee collection epoch often would have to wait a number of weeks or even months before enough fees accumulated to place a single voting incentive lasting 2 weeks.

Work has been ongoing to automate the calculation of these flows, and the system is in good shape to start being used. This BIP introduces and specifies the new automated system for allocating core pool voting incentives, and describes:

* The logic it follows
* The relevant configurations involved and where they can be found/how changes to them are controlled.

## Core Pools 2.0

Most of the changes below pertain to automation. Additionally:

* L2s are moving from distributing fees based on relative TVL to based on relative fee generation.
* As with L2s, 50% of all fees generated on Mainnet will be paid into the core pools voting incentive.
  * This simplifies/unifies the core pool process
  * Measured over the last few rounds, this results in around 5% to 20% of the current USDC flowing directly to veBAL being redirected to vote incentives on Mainnet Core Pools).
* Better attribution and more frequent sweeping/swapping of fees results in a more accurate fee distribution.

### Fee Epoch Process:

* Fees are swept and sold for USDC and BAL on a regular basis by [Mimic](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-115-balancer-smart-vaults-fee-collector/3966).
* Every other Friday, aligning with Aura voting epochs, all available USDC is bridged to the Fee Handling multisig on Mainnet.
* The [automation script](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/blob/main/fee_allocator/notebooks/pool_fees_and_accounting.ipynb) will run and generate csv outputs and a multisig payload in this [directory](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/tree/main/fee_allocator/allocations)
* The payload will be loaded into the fee sweeper multisig, reviewed by the Maxis and then signed/executed.

### Fee Automation:

100% of all $BAL fees earned are sent to veBAL as direct incentives. The below handling pertains to remaining USDC:

#### Allocation of collected protocol fees:

*vote_incentive_pct* percent of the total protocol fees collected on each pool will be allocated to voting incentives daoPct percent of the total protocol fees will be sent to the DAO.

*vebal_share_pct* percent of the total protocol fees will be flowed to veBAL over 2 weeks along with the BAL specified above.

#### Allocation of Voting Incentives:

Allocation of voting incentives occurs per chain. The following logic is applied on each chain, pertaining to the total available fees collected for voting incentives on the same chain:

Each pool on the chains [Core Pools List](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools.json) will be assessed for the USD value of total fees collected over the 2 weeks preceding the fee collection epoch. Pools will be allocated a portion of the available voting incentives based on their relative fee generation.

Any pool that has less than min_vote_incentive_amount in voting incentives will be excluded from the round, and its voting incentives will be distributed to the remaining core pools.

The Voting Incentive amount will be split between veBAL and vlAURA voting markets based on the auraBAL’s total capture of veBAL. If there is less than min_aura_incentive available to allocate voting incentives to AURA, all voting incentives will be shifted to either BAL or Aura in a way that tries to maintain auraBAL capture split across the entire set.

Voting incentives will be placed on one or more voting incentive markets such that the allocated fees flow to the proper set of holders, and are all paid out for votes that generate emissions over the following 2 weeks. Currently Hiddenhand is integrated, but we are happy to explore additional integrations such as Paladin, VoteMarket or other emerging voting markets.

#### Final Payload

All of the transactions to place incentives and pay fees to the DAO and veBAL are packaged up into a multisig payload to be used in the process above.

## Specification/Configuration:

The processes above will be used for generating and adding payloads going forward. The following [initial parameters](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/protocol_fees_constants.json) will be set:

|Parameter|Value|
| --- | --- |
|vote_incentive_pct|%50|
|dao_share_pct|%17.5|
|vebal_share_pct|%32.5|
|min_vote_incentive_amount|$500|
|min_aura_incentive|$500|

The [Core Pools List](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools.json) will be accepted as the current configured list of core pools. Further changes will be made based on payloads approved by governance.

While the system has the capacity to [reroute voting incentives](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools_rerouting.json) from one pool to another in case of a desire to migrate liquidity, none of this rerouting has been configured.

### Future Changes to Configuration

Work will continue on voting incentive automation and all changes will not be brought to governance, however basic intentions of the program and the specific parameters above are considered fixed and not to be changed without a further instruction from governance.

There are considerations around total gas cost to voting incentive//vote/claim. The min_vote_incentive_amount values seek to keep this somewhat under control.

min_vote_incentive_amount may be tuned by the Balancer Maxis up to $1000 USD without a vote in response to on-chain gas costs.

min_aura_incentive shall be maintained such that any Aura Voting Incentive always achieves well over the minimum votes required on Aura to register for a veBAL vote. The Balancer Maxis shall be granted the responsibility and authority for maintaining this value.

All changes to any of the configurations specified above should be made by a governance vote that includes a payload PR with the specific changes.",bullish,2.952,2023-10-19 08:50:27+00:00,3.112,3.112,2023-10-21 00:00:00+00:00,5.42005420054201,3.051,0.0335365853658537,0.8907010555267334,True," This text outlines the allocation process for protocol fees collected on various pools in the Balancer ecosystem. Here's a summary:

- 50% of the total protocol fees will be allocated to voting incentives (for encouraging liquidity provision).
- 17.5% of the total protocol fees will be sent to the DAO.
- 32.5% of the total protocol fees will flow to veBAL over a period of two weeks.

The allocation of voting incentives is calculated per chain, based on each pool's relative fee generation over the preceding 2 weeks. Pools with less than $500 in voting incentives will be excluded from the round, and their voting incentives will be distributed to the remaining core pools.

The Voting Incentive amount is split between veBAL and vlAURA voting markets based on auraBAL’s total capture of veBAL. If there's less than $500 available for AURA, all voting incentives will be shifted to either BAL or AURA in a way that maintains auraBAL capture split across the entire set.

All transactions to place incentives and pay fees are packaged into a multisig payload. The initial parameters have been set at 50% for vote_incentive_pct, 17.5% for dao_share_pct, 32.5% for vebal_share_pct, $500 for min_vote_incentive_amount, and $500 for min_aura_incentive. The Core Pools List is accepted as the current configured list of core pools, with changes based on governance approval.

Future changes to configuration will be made, but basic intentions and specific parameters are considered fixed without further instruction from governance. There are considerations around gas costs for voting incentives/vote/claim, and min_vote_incentive_amount may be adjusted by the Balancer Maxis up to $1000 USD without a vote in response to on-chain gas costs.

Current onchain liquidity is sitting at only 300k while generating in the past few days over 4m$ in volume incentives & bribes to deepen liquidity at this stage of growth is key for Manifold.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** 

Governance utilizes an architecture of elected dictator. By staking FOLD tokens, you delegate protocol control to one address (the dictator). The dictator offers a tribute (rewards) for your support. Accounts that are participating in the dictator regime may elect to vote for a new supreme dictator (operator/management for the protocol) by removing their support and reallocating it towards a new address.  
Source : https://github.com/manifoldfinance/majordomo

A known attack vector involving sandwich staking is mitigated by manually disbursing tributes. This attack vector will be mitigated by a time-dependent withdrawal period in our V2 Vault upgrade. 

> Note that this attack vector has never been actually realized, as it was caught beforehand

Protocol Fees are immediately collected in a vault which then distributes it over time (the time withdrawal is to prevent MEV attacks against the protocol in which accounts enter/exit during certain periods of time). 

A Multisig address is available. The multisig only holds tokens for the purposes of voting in governance proposals of other DAO's. This will be migrated to a vault-based permissive action list structure in which the tokens are held in-vault, with certain permissions enabled for the operator address only. 

2. **Oracles:** 

Not Applicable. 

3. **Audits:**  

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/pki#security-bug-handling-process

https://www.manifoldfinance.com/.well-known/security.txt

Additionally they maintain the DeFi Threat Matrix which is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations on decentralized finance

https://github.com/manifoldfinance/defi-threat/security/advisories?state=published



4. **Centralization vectors:** 

They utilize a concept of Permissive Action List to enable a two-step ownership process for any partner integrations. 

Centralization risks include but are not limited to:

GitHub - we perform off site backups and coordination in the event of GitHub deleting the manifoldfinance org (see LMDBX event for an example).

Google Services: We utilize a domain name not administered by Google for internal services such as user registration, etc. This is not the manifoldfinance.com email address.

Governance Discussions occur on a centralized service, Discourse. [see forums.manifoldfinance.com](https://forums.manifoldfinance.com)

There are also certain account addresses with a large amount of FOLD tokens. However we feel that due to the 'unique' governance regime that this is not in practice a risk factor as it would normally be under traditional DAO governance structures. 

5. **Market History:** 

Pool has been activated in the past 14 days and saw over 225k volume since inception on approximately 84k$ BPT with a current APR of 256% & fees of 1200$ in the past 24h.

Manifold Finance offers secure access to high-value transaction pools through their SecureRPC infrastructure and aggregates multiple endpoints along with mining pools/validator nodes. The motivation behind this proposal is to deepen liquidity as current onchain liquidity is low, yet the platform has generated significant volume incentives and bribes in recent days.

The governance structure of Manifold Finance utilizes an elected dictator model, where FOLD token holders delegate protocol control to one address (the dictator) in exchange for rewards. The text also mentions that they have measures in place to mitigate potential attack vectors and maintain security through audits, oracle usage, and a permissive action list structure.

The proposed gauge is currently active for 14 days and has seen substantial volume since its inception. The value of this pool on Sushiswap is significant, although it's noted that LP are primarily located there with only 3% APY emissions, making it challenging to force movement but potentially attractive due to BAL rewards and bribes.",bullish,very_high

**Summary:**

> This pool uses the [ComposableStablePoolFactory-v3 ](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdba127fbc23fb20f5929c546af220a991b5c6e01#readContract) and is composed of  USDC, DAI, and USDT. Currently there is no designated pool for liqudity providers to park their stablecoin liquidity without being exposed to some form of yield/external risk. The [Euler exploit](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/euler-hack-post-mortem/4490) showed the danger here and it is in Balancer's best interest to not give LPs no choice but to go to another platform if they're against boosted pools. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. The gauge can be uncapped based on the contents being all large cap stable tokens.

**Protocol Description:**

> USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO. USDT is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Tether.

**Motivation:**

> Currently the 3pool architecture is being offered on Balancer only in the form of boosted pools. While boosted pools are 'mostly' safe, we all learned then when a black swan event such as the Euler hack occurs exposure to yield sources can be detrimental. This 3pool is meant to allow LPs to park their stables in a Balancer pool which is not exposed to these risks. Ideally this pool will still drive a large amount of trading volume through Balancer due to sizeable depth. 

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** USDC are centralized and does not have a governance forum. DAI is collateralized by MakerDAO. 
2. **Oracles:** N/A
3. **Audits:** N/A

5. **Market History:** See USDC [here ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/%5D(https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin)).
6. **Value:** LPs & Balancer will earn swap fees and not be exposed to any lending protocols, like the boosted pool options Balancer has. BIP-19 will incentivize TVL to continue to grow here with trading volume increasing with depth.

**Summary:**

Add a a gauge for MAI/USDC on Ethereum.

**References/Useful links:**

> Link to: (cant put more than 2 links on a proposal, so linked in a reply)


**Protocol Description:**

MAI is the most crosschain decentralized stablecoin. It is overcollateralized by decentralized collaterals. MAI has been tested and maintained its peg during several market downturns, notably in May 2022.

The protocol is currently the #1 external use case for BAL on Polygon. It also incentivizes the main Balancer stablecoin pool on Polygon as well as other pools on Arbitrum and Fantom (Beethoven).

**Motivation:**

MAI is the only means to bridge large sums of capital across the broader crosschain universe. This is a good opportunity for Balancer to capture volume from whales bridging in and out of Ethereum.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    

MAI is controlled by a DAO. More info can be found here: https://docs.mai.finance/tokenomics-1/qi-token

2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.

We use Chainlink oracles to price collateral assets.

3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.

The protocol has been audited twice. Audits can be found here: https://docs.mai.finance/risks/security

4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.

The protocol runs on decentralized systems such as competitive liquidations, and vote-based collateral onboarding. No single person has admin controls over the protocol. The treasury and some part of the protocol are secured by a multisig of doxxed team members.

5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**

MAI has remained stable over the last 12 months, despite adverse market conditions. MAI has held Curve pools for several months, for most of which it has provided a considerable share of volume on Polygon and Fantom.

The pool in question on this proposal was created recently with the aim of launching QiDao on Ethereum.
 
6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) 

This will be the only intial incentivized liquidity on Ethereum for MAI.

# Summary

* This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for pxETH/frxETH on Arbitrum.
* The underlying pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP). E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.
* The pool shall has a swap fee of 4 basis points, i.e., 0.04% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.

**Protocol Description:**

> pxETH is a liquid and fungible receipt token for ETH deposited into the Dinero protocol. pxETH is built on top of the Redacted DAO's Pirex platform and forms an integral part of Redacted’s Dinero protocol, a protocol which aims to vertically integrate ETH staking, block proposal and building, a RPC, leverage, and yield stripping into one synergistic ecosystem comprising pxETH, the Redacted Relayer RPC, and the DINERO stablecoin. pxETH provides users with a liquid and fungible tokenized staked ETH which benefits from Ethereum staking rewards and other revenue forms such as MEV tips and block rewards. Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).

In addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.

pxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.

The governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.

**Motivation:**

> Redacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.

An LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.

By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:

* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.

* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.

Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps 1

# Specifications

## Governance

The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.

## Oracles

No oracles are currently used.

## Audits

Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.

## Centralization vectors

No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.

## Market History

The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available[ here 1](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).

title: [Proposal] Whitelist Index Coop's Investment Account Gnosis Safe for Balancer's VotingEscrow
status: Proposed
author: @Matthew_Graham (Index Coop)
created: 10-05-2022

---

# Summary

The proposal aims to add Index Coop DAO’s Investment Account address to the Balancer VotingEscrow whitelist. This will enable the Index Coop Community to vote-lock BAL (B-80BAL-20WETH) and participate in Balancer DAO’s governance, [1].

# Abstract

Index Coop has been in discussions with Balancer DAO about building indices products on Balancer v2 and just recently, created its first liquidity pool on Balancer v2 on the Polygon network, [2,3,4,5]. This delta neutral pool of leverage trading products is the first basket of Index Coop products and symbolisies Index Coop’s strong desire to work with the Balancer community. Index Coop would like to continue investing in the Balancer community relationship by being able to vote-lock BAL (B-80/20 BAL/ETH) and to again, be an active participant within the Balancer DAO governance process.

At the time of writing, Index Coop has approximately $4.4M of capital deposited into the Balancer Boosted Pool on mainnet and to date has earned around 2,500 BAL, [6,7,8]. Index Coop intends to deposit BAL with ETH into the B-80BAL-20WETH pool.

# Motivation

Index Coop intends to build financial products on Balancer v2. To date we have explored creating managed pools that resembled a basket of tokens much like DPI and more recently began exploring how to integrate several products into a single liquidity pool. We had hoped the LAYER1 product would be the first collaboration project and there was strong support within the Index Coop community to build this product on Balancer v2, [9]. It now appears, LAYER1 may not be the initial collaboration product and other opportunities are being explored.

In preparation, Index Coop deployed a portion of the DAOs stablecoins to earn BAL rewards with the intention of locking those BAL rewards and using the veBAL position to support growing future products developed on Balancer v2. With the introduction of ve tokenomics, there is a need for Index Coop to lock the BAL, attain the boosted rewards APY and maximise the veBAL holding potential in order to best support future product launches.

Index Coop has recently created a delta neutral Flexible Leverage Indice pool on Balancer v2 on the Polygon network, [2,3,4,5]. These pools are the first pool where Index Coop is creating a basket of products in one pool. Longer term, the vision is to integrate various strategies like icETH into Balancer Boosted Pools via Index Coop’s exchange issuance. This is expected to offer users varying combinations of yield and risk profile investment options whilst also providing liquidity to the underlying assets.

Prior to the introduction of ve Tokenomics, Index Coop was a keen participant in Balancer DAO’s governance process. Index Coop participated as a DAO on 27 BAL votes, [10]. Although Index Coop’s holding is small, it can still be used to actively participate in Balancer’s governance process.

# Specification

Whitelist `0x462A63D4405A6462b157341A78Fd1baBfD3F8065` to interact with the veBAL contract, [7].

**Summary:**
The Tetu Protocol has been actively building within the Balancer ecosystem, with tetuBAL serving as its primary Balancer-focused product. 
Tetu wants to leverage boosted pool functionality by introducing the [bb-t-usd](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xb3d658d5b95bf04e2932370dd1ff976fe18dd66a000000000000000000000ace) composable pool which consists of 3 liner pools ([bb-t-USDC](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xae646817e458c0be890b81e8d880206710e3c44e000000000000000000000acb), [bb-t-DAI](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xda1cd1711743e57dd57102e9e61b75f3587703da000000000000000000000acc), [bb-t-USDT](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x7c82a23b4c48d796dee36a9ca215b641c6a8709d000000000000000000000acd))

**Protocol Description:**

Tetu is an asset management protocol that implements automated yield farming strategy for users.

**Motivation:**

> The implementation of linear and boosted pools is gradually enhancing Balancer's capacity to boost capital efficiency throughout the protocol. The robust boosted pool aligns with Balancer's objective to offer a secure platform for LPs to access external yield sources while simultaneously ensuring efficient liquidity for swapping. This approach benefits both LPs and the DAO, generating yield

1019,1836,5040,5040,5040,2022-03-18 15:04:50+00:00,balancer,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-delegate-treasury-subdao-the-power-to-invest-protocol-fees/2628).

*This is a proposal by the Treasury subDAO, specifically Solarcurve, Xeonus, Zekraken, and Luuk.*

# Motivation

With the recent approval by governance of veBAL, the Treasury subDAO has been tasked with sweeping collected protocol fees, converting them to bbaUSD, and sending them to veBAL lockers. The protocol fees will be split with 75% going to veBAL and 25% going to Balancer DAO. Treasury subDAO is best positioned to manage the investment of the DAO’s share of revenue.

All collected protocol fees up to the time of veBAL activation will go to Balancer DAO. Treasury subDAO will initiate a sweep of all collected protocol fees just before the launch of veBAL and invest them on behalf of the DAO. Going forward, protocol fees will be distributed to veBAL on a weekly basis. This process will be completely transparent - anyone interested in observing should reach out in #treasury in discord.

The needs of Balancer DAO will change over time so the methodology we will use to invest the DAO’s share of revenue will also change. The main pillars of the initial framework around how protocol fees are invested are:

* Reduce selling pressure on BAL as a result of DAO operations
  * Use protocol fees to accumulate stables to use for compensation/budget requirements, rather than using BAL that guaranteed gets sold.
* Ensure operational runway for the DAO in any market conditions
  * Building a base of stables helps to ensure the DAO can continue to operate in an extended downturn for BAL price
* Maximize the risk-adjusted yield for all DAO assets
  * USDC is less risky than FEI but earns a lower yield for example. Generally, we plan to be more risk-averse than yield-seeking.
* Build Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL)
  * bbaUSD is an example of a low risk stable product that earns a guaranteed yield and helps Balancer by increasing TVL, volume, and fees. POL creates a tailwind behind the growth of Balancer’s key metrics and we plan to stack diversified POL as much as we reasonably can.

# Risks

* Treasury subDAO goes rogue and sends swept fees to their personal wallets
  * Mitigation: The DAO Multisig will sweep collected protocol fees to a gnosis safe with the Treasury subDAO signers (Solarcurve, Xeonus, Luuk, Zekraken). Transactions will require three out of four signatures to execute. The process of converting fees to stables will take place during our weekly meeting and is open to the public to observe.

# Specification

In order to account for gas costs and the time investment of Treasury subDAO signers, collected protocol fees will only be “swept” if the token balance exceeds $10k on Ethereum and $5k on Polygon & Arbitrum.

The process for sweeping fees and sending to veBAL will be as follows:

1. Governance multisig on each chain will initiate a transaction to sweep collected fees meeting the above criteria to a gnosis safe controlled by Treasury subDAO
2. Treasury subDAO will sell assets to stablecoins for veBAL and trade as necessary based on how the DAO plans to invest their portion
3. Treasury subDAO will bridge stablecoins for veBAL back to mainnet. The DAO’s share may or may not be bridged to mainnet.
4. Treasury subDAO will send bbaUSD to the veBAL distribution contract and send the DAO’s share to the DAO Multisig. Treasury subDAO will not custody DAO funds after this process is completed.

**To be clear, a “Yes” vote would give the power to invest the DAO’s share of protocol fees to the Treasury subDAO at their discretion (trading assets, providing liquidity, etc). A “No” vote would mean the DAO’s share of protocol fees will simply be swept into the Treasury Multisig on each chain in whatever asset they happen to be in.**

No matter the outcome, Treasury subDAO will still be sweeping protocol fees and converting 75% to bbaUSD to pay out to veBAL until an automated solution is put in place.",bullish,11.85,2022-03-18 15:04:50+00:00,12.86,12.86,2022-03-19 00:00:00+00:00,8.52320675105485,12.1,0.0210970464135021,0.9238372445106506,True," The text presents a proposal by the Treasury subDAO to manage the investment of Balancer DAO's share of protocol fees.

1020,1838,5044,5044,5044,2022-03-26 11:40:50+00:00,balancer,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-polygon-authorize-batch-relayer-v2-for-usd-boosted-pool/2655).

This proposal aims to authorize an updated version of the Batch Relayer which adds (un)wrapping capabilities for [ERC-4626 tokens](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) and [UnbuttonTokens](https://github.com/buttonwood-protocol/button-wrappers/blob/main/contracts/UnbuttonToken.sol#L18). For reference, the [original Batch Relayer](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0xedff802a4ffb1ba0e131c7d4126fa669648a9333860a74de57c9e5971b9ec541) enabled atomic sequences of `swaps`, `joins`, and `exits`, as well as (un)wrapping of stETH and Aave aTokens. Batch Relayer V2 retains all of those features from V1.

This proposal seeks authorization for Batch Relayer V2 **only on Polygon**, as it is anticipated that a Batch Relayer V3 will soon be available on all networks. This intermediate release is targeted specifically at a new USD+ Boosted Pool on Polygon.

The relayer would be granted authority to perform the following tasks on behalf of users **who have opted into using it**:

* Leverage the user’s existing Vault allowances and internal balances to avoid duplicate approvals.
* Swap on the user’s behalf.
* Add and remove liquidity on the user’s behalf.

## Motivation

The team at [Overnight](https://overnight.fi/), who created the USD+ yield-bearing stable coin, played a significant role in the development of the new [`ERC4626LinearPool`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/pool-linear/contracts/erc4626/ERC4626LinearPool.sol). This pool supports tokens implementing the recently finalized [EIP-4626 Tokenized Vault Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626), and the Balancer Integrations Team believes it has the potential to open up Boosted Pools to a plethora of yield-bearing tokens. We thank Overnight for their patience throughout the integrations process and would like to add relayer support for their new pool as soon as possible.

The relayer will enable trades involving the rebasing USD+ which is incompatible with the Balancer Vault. It does this by (un)wrapping from/to the StaticUsdPlus token, which is an ERC-4626 token wrapper that removes the rebasing component. This will effectively create direct markets for USD+ on Balancer, not only via DAI, USDC, and USDT, but also via multihop to any other connected token within the Vault. For example, the relayer would enable the following atomic DAI->USD+ trade:

1. perform a multihop batch swap from DAI to StaticUsdPlus through the USD+ Boosted Pool;
2. unwrap the StaticUsdPlus tokens from step 1, receiving plain USD+ tokens;

## Risks

This proposal would only grant the required roles to the `BalancerRelayer` contract. Each user would still be required to opt into the relayer by submitting an approval transaction or signing a message.

The code is a simple wrapper over existing Balancer pool interactions, and it has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the Balancer Labs team.

The addresses of the `BalancerRelayer` and `BatchRelayerLibrary` mentioned in this proposal can be found in the [official repo](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/pull/1182/commits/cc113a4aaa9f3869a5accfdf236eafd6528a74d2).

## Specification

The Balancer governance multisig **on Polygon** would submit a transaction to the `Authorizer` in order to grant the following roles to the `BalancerRelayer`:

1. `manageUserBalance` : Utilize existing Vault allowances and internal balances so that a user does not have to re-approve the new relayer for each token.
2. `joinPool` : Add liquidity to a pool on the user’s behalf.
3. `exitPool` : Remove liquidity from a pool on the user’s behalf.
4. `swap` : Trade within a single pool on the user’s behalf.
5. `batchSwap` : Make a multihop trade or source liquidity from multiple pools.
6. `setRelayerApproval` : Approve the relayer on the user’s behalf (user must still provide a signed message).

The Gnosis Safe at `0xd2bD536ADB0198f74D5f4f2Bd4Fe68Bae1e1Ba80` would send a transaction to the Vault Authorizer at `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` with the following data to authorize the BalancerRelayer at `0xF537dDd7f4cc72C6C08866b62EAe9378f1F62da8`:

**Summary:**
This proposal aims to enable the 80VCX/20WETH gauge to participate in veBAL incentives

**Protocol Description:**

VaultCraft is an on-chain, permissionless protocol where anyone can spin up a vault — an automated asset strategy that optimizes returns on user-deposited funds. This is the first open infrastructure allowing for the modularization of vaults using a protocol-endorsed VaultFactory that ensures the safety of the strategy and its contracts. Vaults can interact with a variety of protocols through the ERC4626-Wrapper and are also stackable in design, meaning you can stack on top of other vaults.

VaultCraft utilizes veTokenomics to boost APY’s on Smart Vaults using oVCX (option-reward token) emissions. Users who LP into Balancer and vote-escrow their LP token can vote on oVCX emission distributions, earn bribes, and boost their yield on Smart Vault deposits.
 
![bip-504-1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreie7xjdczknia2uy5tc3dg7ssngxlqdualp5rcixhcnz5g2wdi3qye)
    



**Motivation:**

As mentioned above, the 80VCX/20WETH pool on Balancer plays a critical role in the protocol’s tokenomic flywheel. Additionally, ensuring deep liquidity in this pool is necessary to meet the demand of sell pressure from oVCX emissions and the corresponding treasury buy & burn program.

VaultCraft has set a clear priority to integrate Balancer throughout the protocol’s building blocks. Using a Balancer 80/20 pool as the primary liquidity source, the Balancer LP token as the vote-escrow lock token, integrating Balancer and Aura as yield sources in the [Vault Creation Interface (VCI)](https://app.vaultcraft.io/create-vault), and listing [Balancer LP token vaults](https://app.vaultcraft.io/vaults) with [oVCX incentive gauges](https://app.vaultcraft.io/boost).

VaultCraft utilizes veTokenomics to boost APY’s on Smart Vaults using oVCX emissions, and the Balancer LP token is integrated into the system for voting and yield sources. The proposal aims to use a Balancer 80/20 pool as the primary liquidity source, integrate Balancer throughout the protocol's building blocks, and list Balancer LP token vaults with oVCX incentive gauges. The proposal has been audited by multiple firms and has accumulated significant TVL and volume since its creation.",bullish,small
1022,1845,5074,5074,5074,2022-04-25 18:27:25+00:00,balancer,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-empower-balancerdao-to-add-approved-gauges-to-vebal-voting/3045)

## Introduction

The launch of veBAL has introduced the gauge voting system where veBAL lockers determine BAL emissions by voting for specific pool gauges. A flow has been created on the forum to facilitate approval of new gauges with several votes already passing in just the first three weeks. This proposal aims to streamline this process by delegating the power to add approved gauges to the voting list to the Balancer DAO.

*It is important to make clear that no gauge will be added by BalancerDAO without going through the forum process for approving a new gauge and successfully completing a snapshot vote in favor.*

## Motivation

To alleviate the workload from the DAO Multisig, I am proposing to delegate the power to add approved gauges to this gnosis safe: `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`. This safe already has the power to add new gauges for token rewards other than BAL so it makes sense to keep all gauge activities in the same place. Signers include myself, Mike B, Andrea, Xeonus, Zekraken, Luuk, and Markus who are some of the longest serving and most reliable members of Balancer DAO.

This group of signers will be responsible for ensuring that only approved gauges and gauges which have been correctly set up are added to the voting list. In practice this means the following:

* Ensuring that each forum proposal for a gauge gets adequate attention and that only pools with legitimate tokens are allowed to go for a vote (we don’t want to give BAL emissions to a pool with Uniswap LP tokens or an obvious scam token)
* For L2 gauges, checking that the root gauge has been correctly set up
  * Checking that the root gauge’s recipient getRecipient() is the address of the streamer contract on L2
  * Checking that the L2 gauge contract comes from the L2 factory (factory.isGaugeFromFactory(streamer))
  * Checking that the L2 gauge’s reward_contract is the streamer
  * Checking that the recipient reward_reciever() is a gauge with the LP token matching the pool from the approved vote

> # Summary
> 
> * **This is a proposal to enable five uncapped Balancer gauges for the following Arbitrum pools:**
>   *  sUSDe/GYD
>   * rETH/wstETH
>   * aGHO/GYD
>   * wUSDM/aUSDC
>   * sFRAX/aFRAX
> * **Every one of the pools is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP)**. E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.
> * **GYD is an all-weather stablecoin that provides one-stop access to stablecoin risk control.** GYD is fully backed by a set of assets with fundamental innovations in risk control built in at the protocol level to automate diversification and redundancy.
> * **Each pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope. As a Core pool it will be eligible for fee recycling.

> 
> * GYD is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by the [Gyroscope protocol](https://gyro.finance/)
> 
> * USDe can be staked for *sUSDe* which accrues rewards. USDe is enabled via hedging the delta of spot assets backing the token during minting. - [Ethena](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/solution-usde)

>* aUSDC is the deposit receipt token issued by the [Aave](https://aave.com/) protocol to lenders of USDC. Since aTokens are rebasing, this pool uses BGD Labs’s [statA wrapper ](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3) that is a repricing representation of statA tokens that reflects the accruing lending yield.
>* aGHO is the deposit receipt token issued by the [Aave](https://aave.com/) protocol to lenders of GHO.

> * Staked FRAX (sFRAX) is an ERC4626 staking vault that distributes part of the Frax Protocol yield weekly to stakers denominated in FRAX stablecoins. The sFRAX token represents pro rata deposits within the vault and is always withdrawable for FRAX stablecoins at the pro rata rate at all times. - [Frax ](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)

> # Motivation
> 
> The capital efficiency of E-CLPs will help to quickly bootstrap a liquidity network for GYD. This hub-and-spoke network will enable a liquid secondary market for GYD to make it easier to exit from/ enter into GYD.
> 
> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:
> 
> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.
> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.
> 
> Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps

> # Specifications
> 
> > ## Governance
> > 
> > The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.

Through a continued analysis of our approved gauges I have identified five gauges that I believe should be migrated to a 2% cap. The historical and current activity (bribing/voting) has never approached the 2% limit and it is unlikely any of these would scale if they happen to be directed a large amount of BAL emissions. The relevant teams have been made aware of our plans and are in agreement on this course of action. 

Gauges to be migrated: COW/WETH, COW/GNO, VITA/WETH (50/50), TEL/BAL/USDC, TEL/BAL

### Specification
#1
If approved, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction to the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling `grantRole` with the following arguments:

role: `0xf49d7ffb5922642adc9f29cfb52b2214e81e0b0e54e9cd1e9f70439f0011f368`

This corresponds with the role for calling `add_gauge` on the `gaugeController` as seen [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json#L347).

account: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`

This allows the DAO Multisig to directly add gauges to the controller.

#2

 The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the `AuthorizerAdaptor` at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call `performAction` with the `GaugeController` at `0xC128468b7Ce63eA702C1f104D55A2566b13D3ABD` for the `target(address)` argument and using `0x3a04f900` followed by each one of the gauge addresses listed below and their corresponding gauge types for the `data(bytes)` argument. Each gauge will be its own transaction, thus there will be a total of **5** transactions.

The DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will initiate a transaction to the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling `renounceRole` with the following arguments:

role: `0xf49d7ffb5922642adc9f29cfb52b2214e81e0b0e54e9cd1e9f70439f0011f368`

This corresponds with the role for calling `add_gauge` on the `gaugeController` as seen [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json#L347).

account: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`

This removes the ability for the DAO Multisig to directly add gauges to the controller.

The new capped gauges will be live for voting by September 15th. The old gauges will be killed on September 21st. This allows enough time for votes and bribes to be moved over to the new capped gauges.

On September 21st, the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the `AuthorizerAdaptor` at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call `performAction` using `0xab8f0945` for the `data(bytes)` argument and the following list of contracts for the `target(address)` argument. Each contract will be its own transaction, thus there will be a total of **5** transactions.

**Summary:**

>This wstETH/GHO pool to be a 80wstETH-20GHO [Weighted Pool](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/pool-weighted/contracts). This gauge is uncapped, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329). This means 65% of 50% of yield generated by this pool is to be used for bribing for votes on it via [Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/balancer). The remaining 35% goes to Balancer DAO as revenue.

**Motivation**
> 
> This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the Balancer Aave v3 Boosted Pool (bb-a-USD) on Polygon.
> 
> Users will be able to migrate from the existing bb-a-USD pool built on Aave v2 to the new Aave v3 Boosted pool. The deposit yield on Aave v3 exceeds the deposit rate offered on Aave v2.  
> 
> There are wrappers for depositing funds into Aave Reserves, the linear pools, already deployed, utilise the wrapper developed by Aave Companies. This is the same wrapper used across all Aave linear pools.  
> 
> Balancer will be able to generate revenue from the yield generated by user's funds being deposited into Aave v3.
> 
> This pool uses the ComposableStablePoolFactory-v3 1 which addresses the [reentrancy vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345) disclosed during February 2023. This gauge is uncapped, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329). A portion fo the yield also allocated to bribes via Hidden hand there is a feedback loop which helps sustain the pool.

*This is a proposal authored by the Ops SubDAO - specifically Solarcurve, Mog, and mkflow.*

*A community call is scheduled for January 26th at 12pm EST in Balancer’s discord to discuss this proposal and answer any questions*

**Motivation**

After the successful passing of the recent [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66) to formalize the organization structure of Balancer DAO, each subDAO has hit the ground running in their respective areas. Beyond that, working groups like “Community Dev” also continue to be hard at work in service of the broader DAO.

This proposal is intended to outline the expected budget for Balancer DAO for the first quarter 2022. Please see a breakdown of compensation for February [here](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/5f9e713ac0c740b5bf57e778afad1599?v=150f8cdf222e4c9cb35a6200d0466159). Ops will take a very active role in ensuring compensation accurately reflects contribution efforts for all DAO participants so it is possible for changes to occur at any time. For the purposes of this proposal, we will estimate March compensation to be the same as February. For January, Grants subDAO is covered on their compensation from their previous funding proposal. The January total reflects compensation funding needs excluding Grants. 

**5,900 BAL for January + 6,800 BAL for February * 2 = 19,500 BAL total expected compensation.**

*Note that we will be running a DAO-wide Coordinape circle during February and March with an allocation of 2,000 BAL per month. This cost has graciously been offered as a gift from Fernando to the DAO, which we are very grateful for.*

Excluding compensation, please see a breakdown of the expected budget for Balancer DAO for he first quarter [here](https://balancergrants.notion.site/6ac72778504b4d6cad0541b3006e5b45?v=7d4a0ca953b54e5d889ce9fe15ae0a33). Ops will ensure an accurate record is kept of any disbursements - this will be presented as part of the next budget proposal so that token holders can make a more informed decision about the effectiveness of the DAO’s expenditures. A certain amount of good faith is required for now since there is not much of a record to judge currently.

**2,605 BAL for Q1 DAO Budget (excluding compensation)**

**Specification**

Ops will always custody compensation funds to ensure that we can fulfill our mandate and to alleviate the administrative burden from the rest of the DAO. Ops also has the option to custody general budget funds as well. Given that the budget requests are relatively small, the expense of creating new multisigs for each subDao and paying gas costs is not economical. Thus, Ops will custody both compensation and general budget funds for the first quarter.

If this proposal is approved, a transaction will be initiated from the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) to send 22,105 BAL to the Ops Multisig (0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325)",bullish,11.49,2022-01-27 20:19:59+00:00,12.67,12.67,2022-01-29 00:00:00+00:00,10.26979982593559,12.170000000000002,0.0591818973020018,0.8850285112857819,True," The text discusses a proposal for the budget of Balancer DAO for Q1 2022, authored by Ops SubDAO.

**Summary:**

DFX Finance’s proposal to (1) add a gauge for the DFX(L2)/ETH 50/50 on Arbitrum (2) deprecate the gauge for the DFX/ETH 50/50 on Arbitrum

References/Useful links:

Website: [Main Website](https://dfx.finance/), [dApp](https://app.dfx.finance/)

• Documentation: [Gitbook](https://docs.dfx.finance/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@dfxfinance)

• Github Page: [Github](https://github.com/dfx-finance)

**Protocol Description:**

DFX Finance is a decentralized foreign exchange (FX) protocol that facilitates the seamless exchange of fiat-backed stablecoins denominated in a growing number of currencies. Using a hyper-efficient AMM, optimized for low volatility trading, DFX provides FX swaps with rates that will beat any bank, money changer, or FX platform. DFX is the governance token of DFX Finance which allows users to vote on protocol changes and initiatives of the DAO, and also allows users to receive boosted emissions on deposits within the DFX ecosystem.

**Price History DFX:**

Price History for DFX can be found on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dfx-finance)

**Motivation:**

The DFX token on L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon is migrating from a bridged token to a Chainlink CCIP token. As well, DFX Finance is committed to continue to engage in the Hiddenhand Finance ecosystem in a meaningful way to further deepen DFX liquidity onchain.

**Specifications:**

1. Governance: DFX tokens serve as the governance token for the DFX Finance protocol. DFX token holders can vote on governance proposals through DFX’s snapshot. DFX forum is also used to discuss potential protocol changes and improvements.
2. Oracles: DFX token does not rely on any external oracles. The DFX stablecoin pools uses Chainlink for its real world forex price feeds to facilitate efficient stablecoin swaps close to the spot price. The feeds can be found here: [Decentralized Price Reference Data | Chainlink](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/fiat)
3. Audits: DFX has engaged with multiple auditors including engagements with Trail of Bits, Haechi, and Zellic to audit the DFX smart contracts.
4. Centralization vectors: Treasury functions are controlled by a 2/4 multisig including treasury yield farming, and paying bribes.
5. Market History: DFX has been transferable since March 2021.
6. Value: This pool will be the primary source of liquidity for DFX on Arbitrum and Polygon

# Motivation

For those unaware, the DAO Multisig is composed of ten signers and is responsible for governance admin of Balancer’s Ethereum deployment. In addition, it controls BalancerDAO’s treasury assets across all chains where we have an economic interest - currently Fantom, Polygon, and Arbitrum.

The following signers have agreed to rotate off as they are very busy with other activities:

* Ash Egan (0x95CeFcAD4daE89aE09c8166E324A8b235289897E)

* Cooper Turley (0xC98475a717215150c76E9689d665B59bCff5FA76)

The following people have agreed to be added to the replacement signer list:

* Ariah, Stablecoin Labs (0xbcf751dBfe314Ee96A660EFA2Fcb259CBc364c29)

**Summary**
In an effort to scale the amount of quality, long-form research available, we are proposing Balancer joins the [Messari Hub](https://messari.io/hub) to commission quarterly financial reports. This would serve to better inform the crypto ecosystem on major developments and ongoing fundamental changes, effectively attracting more builders, investors, and traders to the ecosystem.

**Background**
The Messari Hub is a community-driven marketplace for public research where we work with top projects and independent analysts to increase the amount of quality, open source [research](https://messari.io/research/hub). One particular area of research we think many DeFi projects would benefit from is more standardized financial reporting with contextual analysis.

An example of this was in our [recent](https://messari.io/article/state-of-compound-q3-2021) Q3 report for Compound where we outlined all the key fundamental data points and analyzed why they occurred. We also took a look at major governance decisions over the past three months and assessed the implications of upcoming changes to the protocol.


In addition, we would build and maintain a comprehensive [data dashboard](https://dune.xyz/messari/Messari:-Compound-Macro-Financial-Statements) to view these metrics in real-time.

All reports would live as free resources on Messari and would be distributed through our newsletter (210k subscribers) and various social channels.

**Rationale**

We believe the actionable insights generated from these reports will better educate stakeholders on the economic, financial, and social health of the project, whether it’s a surge in certain markets liquidity/volume or the implications of a major governance decision. As more players in the space are adequately informed it will help them make better decisions and allocate resources more effectively.

Furthermore, as more and more traditional institutions get onboarded to DeFi they will seek to have consistent reporting similar to quarterly financial reports and sell-side equity research with which to rely on to make key decisions. By blending the objective reporting of a 10-Q with the contextualization of sell-side research, these players will grow increasingly comfortable trading with and investing in this new financial infrastructure.

**Terms**

We are requesting a payment of 125,000 USDC to be sent to messari.eth which resolves to 0x6fA2BACF752DAb6cb6E4B922321F03b4Cb61D141

1031,1858,5119,5119,5119,2023-11-30 01:10:24+00:00,balancer,"## Intro

Following the developments after the [DNS hack reported here](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/dns-security-incident-post-mortem-1b1feb735aca), and given the precedent set by [BIP-443](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-443-restore-brand-trust-in-balancer-by-assisting-dns-hack-users/5218) and [BIP-455](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-455-assisting-dns-hack-victims/5259), this proposal seeks to refund affected users by the frontend attack with 25% cut.

## Motivation

After refunds of BIP-443 and BIP-455, only 1 (one) user came forward publicly reporting the loss of funds due to the DNS attack. There could potentially be others that might be waiting for the formation of the volunteer committee described on BIP-433 and/or the public announcement of a claiming window.

Given the past refund allocations and known wallets impacted, the expenditure shouldn’t be greater than 34k, even though the program would still have 110.578,95 USDC provisioned. We find it would be better to put this program behind us and therefore suggest using the same deadline in the [[BIP-445] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-445-decide-on-direction-of-restitution-for-affected-lps-in-boosted-pool-incident/5187)regarding the Boosted Pools incident.

## Specification

This proposal will override the specifications on BIP-443, and shall be voted as follows:

1. Affected users will have until Dec 25th, 2023 to post on this thread (or by any means reach out to the Balancer Maxis), being this a final deadline to ask for refunds in a final payment batch coming January.
2. To verify claims, the Balancer Maxis will cross-reference the user’s reported transactions with the [spreadsheet ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nby6q2kyA9PSvrKeMSJtRIFllxzlOHAT96SE38fnGxA/edit#gid=593597477)made public in the incident post-mortem.
3. Users will be asked to verify wallet ownership with a signed message on chain agreeing to the 75% cut and payment in USDC at the time of the attacks (precedent set by BIP-443).
4. Final numbers will be posted in January’24 on a new BIP authorizing payments.

*If passed, this proposal shall be posted by our Marketing team on Discord and Twitter, as well as any interested media outlets, for max comms amplification regarding the deadline.*",bullish,3.668,2023-11-30 01:10:24+00:00,3.96,3.96,2023-12-02 00:00:00+00:00,7.9607415485278,3.9935,0.0887404580152671,0.887664258480072,True," This text discusses a proposal to refund affected users from a previous DNS hack incident, with a suggested 25% cut.

If passed, the proposal will be widely publicized on various platforms. The sentiment of this text is informative and decisive, with an emphasis on transparency and accountability.",bullish,small

The purpose of this contract is to facilitate batch operations in the Balancer ecosystem.

The key functions included in this contract are:
1. exitPool(): Allows a user to withdraw their liquidity from a pool.
2. joinPool(): Allows a user to add liquidity to a pool.
3. manageUserBalance(): Allows the relayer to manage user balances.
4. setRelayerApproval(): Grants or revokes approval for the relayer to perform actions on behalf of a user.
5. swap(): Facilitates token swaps within the Balancer ecosystem.

The risk assessment indicates that this is a routine operation for provisioning a contract deployment/Batch Relayer. Users must approve BatchRelayers before they have access, and more details can be found in the provided documentation.

**Summary:**

> This KEP/rsETH pool to be a 50/50 Weighted Pool.
>
>
>
> This gauge is capped at 2%, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) on the basis of 1% swap fee and rsETH being an Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) that generates yield.

**Protocol Description:**

> *rsETH*
>
>
>
> rsETH is the [third](https://defillama.com/protocols/Liquid%20Restaking) largest LST-based liquid restaked token on the EigenLayer ecosystem. It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp Protocol. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs.
>
>
>
> Kelp has more than 185,000 ETH worth of assets restaked.
>
>
>
> By providing liquidity for the restaked positions, rsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.
>
>
>
> *KEP*
>
>
>
> KEP is a token representation of Kelp's EigenLayer Points, where 1 $KEP = 1 EL Point.
>
>
>
> Launch Details can be found [here](https://twitter.com/KelpDAO/status/1760722182869799390).

**Motivation:**

> Kelp is seeking to establish the KEP/rsETH on Balancer as the primary pool for KEP. This pool is expected to experience large trading volume by creating a secondary market for Kelp's EigenLayer Points.
>
>
>
> Liquidity Providers can expect to receive KEP as well as the normal BAL and AURA rewards.

**Specifications:**

Xave does this by building an FX accurate AMM via a custom “FXPool” now and eventually a stablecoin lending market that shares liquidity with the Balancer V2 Vault via a BoostedFXPool.

**Protocol Description:**

Xave has deployed its first custom pool - the FXPool - that brings FX accurate stablecoin exchange to the Balancer DAO. The first FXPool deployed is an xSGD:USDC pool.

**Motivation:**

StraitsX, the licensed issuer of fiat backed stablecoins xSGD and xIDR, will be helping to build use cases for this pool to enable liquid FX trades and eventually work towards instant, on chain cross border remittance between SGD-IDR and SGD-PHP. Ripple has famously tried to achieve this “on demand liquidity” but stablecoin FX is the true 10x improvement to traditional financial rails. This is especially true as stablecoin rails are able to offer end to end remittances at <1 % per transaction (if anyone is interested, we have a real world cost breakdown). This real world use case will bring sustainable fee generation via real economic activity to the BalancerDAO. Xave and StraitsX would like to work with the BalancerDAO to incentivize this initial pool with BAL rewards towards a real world use case in DeFi.

**Specifications:**
 
1. **Governance:** 
Governance will be done via snapshot for now. Later on Xave's own ve governance structure will be deployed (forked from veBAL). Current admin of the XSGD:USDC FXPool is the team's ops 3/5 multisig 0x74042CE43D1e74FF5627B1e9ff2ee950251b5Db4 (Polygon), until the community is ready to take on ownership of the Xave protocol. 

2. **Oracles:** 
The xSGD:USDC FXPool utilizes a Chainlink oracle to allow FX accurate swaps for a predetermined range of the bonding curve. Beyond this range (called the “beta region”), LP ratio then dictates the price of trades. At this point, arbitrageurs are incentivized by significantly cheaper fees to trade the pool back to the “beta region” where FX price is followed. LPs are also incentivized to keep liquidity in the pool especially while it is outside the “beta region”, due to existing parameters that yield much higher fees charged to traders swapping the pool away from the “beta region”.

3. **Audits:** 
https://docs.xave.finance/contract-audits/v2-final-audit

4. **Centralization vectors:** 
⅗ operations multisig that owns contracts until contracts are “battle tested” and community is ready to takeover

5. **Tokens:** 
xSGD is an asset backed stablecoin, fully collateralized and issued by StraitsX - a licensed and regulated Singaporean entity by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)

USDC is an asset backed stablecoin issued by Centre
 
6. **Value:** 
This pool consists of the first native POS XSGD issued token by its' issuer https://www.straitsx.com/sg who will concentrate liquidity for real world use cases dependent on capital efficient on chain FX to support cross border settlement in the Southeast Asian region ++.

# Abstract

This proposal aims to roll out an updated version of the Zodiac Roles Modifier module. The new version improves usability and transparency of treasury management operations. Upon approval, the Roles Modifier v2 module will be activated.

Furthermore, this proposal requests authorization from the DAO to revise the permissions policy. A notable change includes enabling swapping actions on CoW Swap while the other permissions primarily focus on eliminating obsolete actions and protocols, and refining parameters within the existing permissions.


# Roles v2 Migration


## Motivation

The Zodiac Roles Modifier facilitates karpatkey’s proxy management of the treasury by ensuring that only pre-approved transactions, defined by the permissions policy voted on by the DAO, can be executed. In collaboration with karpatkey, the Gnosis Guild team has significantly upgraded the Zodiac Roles Modifier module and the Zodiac Roles app. These enhancements have resulted in a more powerful and robust on-chain permissions infrastructure with the following improvements:



* **Introduction of Allowances**: Implementation of spending limits within permissions.
* **Enhanced Call Data Scoping Toolset**: This toolset considerably broadens the range of functions that can have permissions set, increasing flexibility.
* **Advanced Logical Conditions**: Allows for the creation of complex permissions structures to accommodate sophisticated operational needs.
* **Compatibility with [DeFi Kit](https://kit.karpatkey.com/)**: This feature integrates with karpatkey’s permissions policy building module, facilitating the straightforward crafting of protocol actions.
* **Improved Visualisation and User Interface**: the new [Zodiac Roles app UI](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/) not only displays permissions clearly but also provides a user-friendly interface to compare changes in each policy update, enhancing transparency and simplifying audits.

For more detailed information, please refer to the following resources:



* **Documentation**: [The Zodiac Roles Modifier](https://docs.roles.gnosisguild.org/)
* **Articles**: [Evolving Smart Accounts with Onchain Permissions](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/oQcy_c62huwNkFS0cMIxXwQzrfG0ESQax8EBc_tWwwk), [Permissions as code](https://engineering.gnosisguild.org/posts/permissions-as-code)


## Contract Audits

The Zodiac Roles Modifier v2 contract has been rigorously audited by G0 Group, the internal auditing team of Gnosis DAO, and by [Omniscia](https://omniscia.io/). The detailed audit reports are available for review [here](https://github.com/gnosisguild/zodiac-modifier-roles/tree/main/packages/evm/docs).


# Changes to the Permissions Policy

This proposal outlines the following modifications to the permissions policy:



* **Token Arrays for Swapping**:
    * Considering the tokens involved in the existing permissions, we have updated the token arrays to ensure they can be seamlessly swapped across the various whitelisted protocols and aggregators.
    * **Token IN Allowlist**: [WBTC, DAI, USDT, stkAAVE, AAVE, COMP,  rETH, SWISE, wstETH, WETH, USDC, stETH].
    * **Token OUT Allowlist**: [WBTC, DAI, USDT, rETH, wstETH, WETH, USDC, stETH].
    * The above arrays are to be utilized for swapping on CoW Swap, with equivalent lists replicated for Uniswap v3 and Balancer.
* **Introduction of CoW Swap**([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0x23da9ade38e4477b23770ded512fd37b12381fab)):
    * Addition of a **CoW Swap Order signer** to enable gas-minimized and MEV-protected swaps. This includes an extensive set of aggregated exchange routes, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of required swaps.
    * Tokens will be swapped on CoW Swap according to the token IN/OUT allowlists mentioned above.
* **Deprecations and Removals**:
    * **Uniswap v2**([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0x68b3465833fb72a70ecdf485e0e4c7bd8665fc45-0x472b43f3)): Removed due to insufficient liquidity in v2 pools.
    * **Sushiswap**([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0x5550d13389bb70f45fcef58f19f6b6e87f6e747d)): Removed due to insufficient liquidity in Sushiswap pools.
    * **Stakewise v2**: Deprecated functions related to deposit ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0xc874b064f465bdd6411d45734b56fac750cda29a)) and claim ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0xa3f21010e8b9a3930996c8849df38f9ca3647c20)) functions in light of the recent launch of Stakewise v3.
    * **Compound v2** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0x3d9819210a31b4961b30ef54be2aed79b9c9cd3b-0x1c3db2e0)): Discontinued all actions targeting v2 contracts and v2 cTokens (cUSDC, cDAI and cAAVE) due to the ongoing transition of the protocol to its v3.
    * **Revocation of Existing/Obsolete Allowances:** All existing and outdated allowances previously set by the treasury are revoked (set to zero). The ability to call the corresponding approve functions is included in the newly proposed policy. Accordingly, the payload contains a bundle of transactions to revoke these allowances.
* **Updates**:
    * **AAVE Delegation:** Delegation function update for AAVE ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9-0xdc937e1c)) and stkAAVE ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5-0xdc937e1c)) tokens. Very similar to the delegate function, with the added option of delegation type.
    * **Uniswap v3** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0x68b3465833fb72a70ecdf485e0e4c7bd8665fc45-0x04e45aaf)) **and Balancer** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8)): Adjusted to allow the mentioned token IN/OUT allowlists.
    * **Lido Withdrawals** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0x889edc2edab5f40e902b864ad4d7ade8e412f9b1)): Enhanced to include new withdrawal methods using permits for both wstETH and stETH; methods include ""requestWithdrawalsWstETHWithPermit"" and ""requestWithdrawalsWithPermit"".
    * **Uniswap v3 WBTC / ETH LP (NFT Id 430246)** actions updated ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88)):
        * Increase Liquidity

# Audit Considerations 

We highly value the community’s involvement in reviewing and providing feedback on this proposal. We encourage members with the necessary technical expertise to examine the content carefully (including this [payload](https://gist.github.com/JeronimoHoulin/848a514985f0f3a1003b4ecfe403cffa)) and share their insights with us.

For effective testing of the permissions policy configuration, we have utilized a [Testing Avatar Safe](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xC01318baB7ee1f5ba734172bF7718b5DC6Ec90E1). This safe mirrors the current state of the [permissions policy v3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQjkn6DAqXhdqYag0KSIfqJvdkLilOb6dM4KqaiybXc/) granted by the DAO treasury (or Avatar SAFE) to the Manager SAFE operated by karpatkey. The enhancements in the Zodiac Roles app interface now allow for a clear visualization of all existing permissions, accessible [here](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xbd1099dfd3c11b65fb4bb19a350da2f5b61efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1).

The updated interface also simplifies the process of identifying [changes](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false) by displaying the current permissions policy on the left side and the newly proposed policy on the right side. To further aid in the adoption and understanding of these tools for audit purposes, we have detailed the proposed changes in [version 4 documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tEeXMJXsz48MKxiST1rmAHT7Pwr0H1fhnoPBo4y24A4/), following our standard Policy Update Request (PUR) format.


# Additional considerations


## Roles Modifier v1 and Enabling of v2

The existing Roles Modifier v1 module will remain active to ensure a smooth transition and prevent any unexpected disruptions in operational execution. Ownership of the deployed [Roles Modifier v2 module](https://etherscan.io/address/0x13c61a25DB73e7a94a244bD2205aDba8b4a60F4a), equipped with the new proposed permissions policy, has been [transferred ](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfca048b5f788c502c8e1aba7a386d4a228622abd582b77497ec6d71d4a549891)to the treasury’s Avatar Safe. The payload will only activate this module, marking the first phase of the migration process. A subsequent policy update proposal will seek to disable the v1 module.


## Policy Visualization in Terms of DeFi Kit Actions

The “show annotations” button, located at the top-right [here](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false), provides a visualization of the proposed permissions policy expressed through the DeFi Kit Protocol Actions.

The changes include a clear display of all existing permissions and an easy comparison between current and proposed policies.

For testing purposes, a Testing Avatar Safe has been used which mirrors the current state of the permissions policy v3 granted by the DAO treasury to the Manager SAFE operated by karpatkey. The updated interface also simplifies the process of identifying changes by displaying the current and proposed policies side-by-side.

The existing Roles Modifier v1 module will remain active during the transition, while ownership of the new Roles Modifier v2 module has been transferred to the treasury’s Avatar Safe. The payload will only activate the v2 module, marking the first phase of the migration process. A subsequent policy update proposal will aim to disable the v1 module.

The interface also includes a ""show annotations"" button that provides a visualization of the proposed permissions policy expressed through DeFi Kit Protocol Actions.

**Summary:**

After a successful launch on Base. The GoldenBoys are expanding to Arbitrum and getting ready to launch some products on mainnet. As many of the rules around caps have been created pertaining to me. I wanted to personally propose a suggestion that I think will be a general improvement for both Balancer and the Golden Boys.

First, to mirror the implementation on Base, which has created necessary USDC/ETH and BAL liquidity on Base, we request the following 2 gauges on Arbitrum:

[50GOLD/25USDC/25wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x2e8ea681fd59c9dc5f32b29de31f782724ef4dcb0001000000000000000004bc) - 6% cap

[25GOLD/25BAL/25AURA/25wstETH] (https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x49b2de7d214070893c038299a57bac5acb8b8a340001000000000000000004be) - 2% cap

As pools containing $GOLD are already receiving 12% of veBAL, and the tokens market cap does not warrant unlimited pools as per the gauge framework. I suggest the following compromises be made, which should increase the overall health of Balancer emissions.

* Reduce cap on [50GOLD/25USDC/25ETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/base/pool/0x433f09ca08623e48bac7128b7105de678e37d988000100000000000000000047) pool to 5%
* I suggest that the 10% cap for Arbitrum Airdrop incentives be shared between the 2 pools.
  * 8% cap on the 50/25/25 pool
  * 2% cap on the 25/25/25/25 pool

Further as a show of good faith:

* I will reduce voting on tetuBAL LP to < 15% of veBAL
* I will reduce voting on BADGER LP to <5% of veBAL
* I will work the Maxi’s to allocate 5% of my total veBAL towards pools that are beneficial to the ecosystem.

Upon review of the current veBAL voting situation, you will see that this outcome moves in a positive direction.

**Protocol Description:**

GOLD is an early, community-driven project that is nested within the Balancer ecosystem and founded by Humpy. Presently, GOLD benefits from Humpy’s large share of Balancer Governance and has created a mutually beneficial relationship on the Base network by bringing Balancer’s Base deployment healthy trading fees and needed USDC/WETH liquidity.

We have just received a good report on the audit of a new product we will release, an Aura Autocompounding Vault, which will offer the best rates to AURA holders (which indirectly supports the Balancer community), and use a healthy portion of protocol fees to buy and burn GOLD.

**Motivation:**

The next major update to the GOLD ecosystem is the release of the GoldAURA Pounder. Aura is not on the Base network, and has focused their L2 presence on Arbitrum. Because the GoldAURA pounder will use protocol fees to buy and burn gold, this will be most efficient conducted on the Arbitrum (the L2 with Aura); furthermore, GOLD holders wish to earn Aura, which can be accomplished on Arbitrum.

By moving GOLD to Arbitrum and launching Balancer Gauges, we also have the opportunity to expand our community beyond people who are interested in the nascent Base network. New Golden Boys are often drawn to the project from outside the Balancer ecosystem. Attracting new community members to the GOLD project directly benefits Balancer as we raise awareness for the Balancer Ecosystem and provide new users for weighted liquidity pools and products like an Aura Pounder.

Moving to Arbitrum allows us to form a tighter bond with Aura and expand the Golden Boys community to the much larger audience on Arbitrum, both of which have benefit to Balancer.

**Specifications:**

* Enable 50/25/25 - 6% cap
* Enable 25/25/25/25 - 2% cap
* Reduce Cap on 50/25/25 Base pool to 5%
* Configure Arbitrum incentive caps for 50/25/25(8%) and 25/25/25/25(2%) pools in the airdrop program config.

## Protocol Description
CoW Protocol lets people swap assets MEV protected at the best exchange rate by leveraging its batch settlement layer built on top of DeFi’s favorite AMMs and DEX Aggregators. Instead of directly executing trades on-chain, users only sign their swap intention and delegate the execution to so-called solvers (aka relayers in other protocols). Solvers bid on the best possible exchange rate in order to win the right to settle trades. By batching multiple trades together in order to create CoWs (Coincidence of Wants), solvers can save on gas costs, AMM fees and execution risk. Therefore CoWs lead to structurally better prices than on any existing DEX aggregator. In the absence of CoWs solvers fall back to using the best possible on-chain route, by comparing quotes from leading aggregators.

## Motivation
Strengthen the COW and BAL communities ties by giving a reward in COW tokens for veBAL voters, while increasing BAL rewards to COW liquidity providers. More in CowDAO proposal [here](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-using-cow-to-boost-bal-rewards-for-cow-lps/783)

## Specification

1.  **Governance**: CowDAO is governed by COW and vCOW token holders through snapshot votes and forum proposals. 

2.  **Oracles**: No use of oracles in CoW Protocol

3.  **Audits**: Settlement contract [audits](https://github.com/gnosis/gp-v2-contracts/tree/main/audits). COW token [audits](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-token/tree/main/audits).

4.  **Centralization vectors**: Orderbook and solver competition are still hosted on a server although decentralizing this part of the stack is on the roadmap. The potential risk is mainly censorship of orders. No user funds are at custody. Limit prices are enforced by an immutable smart contract. 

5.  **Market History**: COW was made transferable on March 28th and was launched with [incentives to provide liquidity on Balancer](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-4-cow-liquidity-incentive-program/295/20) pools.

The proposal aims to increase rewards for COW liquidity providers by boosting BAL rewards using veBAL voting. The COW Protocol is governed by its token holders and has undergone audits, although it still relies on a centralized server for orderbook and solver competition. User funds are not held in custody, and limit prices are enforced by an immutable smart contract. The proposal can be found on the CowDAO forum.",bullish,small

https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/c1c80f66-050b-4f82-94d2-c97ab868079a

# Motivation

The [passing of Safe DAO's SEP-5](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xb4765551b4814b592d02ce67de05527ac1d2b88a8c814c4346ecc0c947c9b941) resulted in new allocations for existing $SAFE holders.

# Urgency

**NOTE**: in order to successfully claim this second airdrop, the vesting needs to be created before 2023-10-27T10:00:00 UTC ([ref](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC0fde70A65C7569Fe919bE57492228DEE8cDb585#code#F1#L53))!

# Specification

Payload consists of three calls:

- `Airdrop2.redeem`: this creates a vesting for the `msg.sender`
- `Airdrop2.claimVestedTokensViaModule`: this claims the $SAFE tokens already vested. By passing a `max(uint128)` we claim all available tokens
- `Airdrop1.claimVestedTokensViaModule`: idem, but claim pending tokens from the vesting created during the initial airdrop

The specified payload consists of three calls aimed at creating vesting and claiming the vested and pending tokens.

## Summary

A series of actions need to happen for the new veBAL tokenomics system to be deployed. This proposal asks for the governance multisig to grant permissions for the coordinator smart contract in order to enable it to perform the actions necessary to successfully deploy the ve system.

## **Core proposal**

As approved by governance[[1]](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html), the ve system pioneered by Curve has been chosen to be used as the new tokenomics for BAL.

Since the community approved that proposal, some Balancer Labs engineers and community members have been hard at work to make this viable. I'm excited to share that we have defined dates for the deployment of the system:

* **28th March: launch of veBAL.** On this date all smart contracts necessary for the system to work as described in the new tokenomics proposal will be active, with the exception of the bridges for Arbitrum and Polygon which will take a couple extra weeks. In the meantime, LM for Arbitrum and Polygon will continue as is today.
* **7th April: beginning of Liquidity Mining using onchain ve contracts for Ethereum mainnet gauges.** Since Balancer LPs need to have some time to stake their BPTs into the new gauge system, I propose we consider all BPTs as still eligible for liquidity mining until April 7th 0:00 UTC. From this day on, only staked BPTs will be able to claim BAL from LM.

## Implementation

The governance multisig needs to call the authorizer[[2]](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa331d84ec860bf466b4cdccfb4ac09a1b43f3ae6#code) with the following inputs: `authorizer.grantRole(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, coordinator)` , which means it will grant full admin powers to the coordinator smart contract.

Only by end of next week (March 25th) will the coordinator be deployed, as it's currently undergoing final adjustments. Since it hasn't been deployed yet, its address is not known. However, the Balancer community will be able to verify the coordinator address by that date on Balancer's github in the deployment output folder[[3]](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220325-veBAL-deployment-coordinator/output/mainnet.json). This link will point to a json file with entry `veBALCoordinator` followed by the coordinator's address on mainnet:

`{   veBALCoordinator: 0xabced...., }`

After deploying the whole system and activating the Liquidity Mining on the new ve system on April 7th, the coordinator will renounce all given permissions and will not be usable anymore.

## **Voting**

Since this governance permission has to be granted before the 28th March for the above deployment plan to work, this proposal should be posted to snapshot ideally by no later than March 22nd. It has no unexpected requests and simply aims at executing the already well discussed and approved veBAL tokenomics, so I hope it will be unanimously welcomed by the Balancer community.

Happy to answer any questions as always =)

In pursuit of this goal, the core contributors have implemented a sophisticated technical architecture, an easy-to-use SDK for integrations, and have created custom AMM pools to demonstrate the potential of the Balancer v2 framework.

Balancer would benefit from product and project management. I would like to help develop and refine the value proposition for developers & token projects. And help service provider organizations / Blabs collaboratively deliver results.

I propose a 3-month assignment to provide a research report to inform the platform strategy and develop a project management framework that I will actively manage with Balancer Labs & SP orgs.

**Strategy research report**

Balancer would benefit from having a detailed understanding of the needs and challenges of web3 developers and projects that could benefit from Balancer technology. A report will seek to answer the following questions:

* Market analysis
  * What types of projects/companies/DAOs are expected to be built using defi primitives?
  * Who are the target projects for Balancer? What products are they building for users?
* Customer needs
  * What are the unique needs of stablecoin issuers? AMM designers? Lending markets?
  * What will drive needs and what are the factors that could change expectations?
* Value proposition opportunities
  * In addition to an SDK, what other features could differentiate Balancer as a platform for defi developers?
  * What pricing models should be considered when partnering / co-launching products with other protocols?

*Note: The above list of questions is indicative and could be revised based on discussions with Balancer contributors.*

**Project management & reporting framework**

Contribution to the Balancer protocol has scaled into several service provider organizations and partner projects. Service provider organizations have highlighted the need for closer coordination and project management. As part of this assignment, I will take an active role in cross SP project management and define an operating framework that can guide Balancer projects. Activities include the following:

* Partner effectively with other service provider orgs to accelerate Balancer projects and product development to define the planning & execution process.
* Develop by week and by month project management and reporting framework.
* Review metrics and reporting reports and recommend improvements.

# Abstract

This proposal introduces additional actions and strategies to the portion of the treasury managed by karpatkey (as per [BIP-103](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-103-karpatkey-balancer-treasury-cu-proposal-update/3895)), aiming to enhance the treasury’s performance, adaptability, and diversification.


# Motivation

Permissions granted to karpatkey to manage the BalancerDAO treasury are not static, and require regular updates to effectively respond to evolving market conditions and to capitalise on emerging opportunities.

As it’s customary, any changes to the preset permissions must be executed by the DAO.


# Specification

Permissions that will be added in this proposal are:



1. Deposit USDC on Compound v3;
2. Deposit DAI on AAVE v3;
3. Deposit USDC on AAVE v3;
4. Deposit DAI on MakerDAO’s Dai Savings Rate (DSR) module;
5. Unstake stETH on Lido;
6. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Rocket Pool (rETH);
7. Swap on Cow Swap


### Audit considerations

We propose an updated version of the [Preset permissions - Balancer Treasury](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQjkn6DAqXhdqYag0KSIfqJvdkLilOb6dM4KqaiybXc/edit) document that shows all the permissions granted to karpatkey, including the ones that are being requested now, highlighted in green.

Reviewing and providing feedback on the preset update [payload](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/1f0d96856166d673551e2f316bace89d) would be a great service to the Balancer community. We welcome anyone who is willing to take the time to verify the content and encourage community members to share their feedback with us.

karpatkey's tech team is diligently working on enhancing the auditing process. Our primary goal is to provide a clearer visual representation of potential Zodiac preset modifications before implementing any proposed payload. We are committed to keeping the community informed about our progress and developments.

# Proposed Actions Overview



### 1. Deposit USDC on Compound v3

[Compound v3](https://docs.compound.finance/) is a streamlined protocol version emphasising security, capital efficiency, and user experience. Following a [proposal](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/180) executed on September 18th, v2 is being phased out, with measures in place to transition users to v3. [OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-iii-audit/) and [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/compound-iii/) have audited v3. As of the day of this writing, $319M USDC is deposited in v3, offering an APR of 4.3%, inclusive of COMP token rewards.



### 2. Deposit DAI on AAVE v3

This strategy aims to diversify stablecoin holdings via AAVE v3, a leading decentralised money market with a strong link to the Balancer DAO. [AAVE v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-aave-v3/6035) was officially [deployed on mainnet](https://aave.mirror.xyz/K9gQPsv-hAH-gO4oH2i0Oen8uQEHYL5q8x9xjN9XnmA) in January 2023 after being live across six networks [since March 2022](https://aave.mirror.xyz/2TnHYHQRnNhSG56Y4CcssulFArSVqrFbmAdYfU7Kxp0). This version introduces features for enhanced capital efficiency and decentralisation, coupled with new risk management tools. Comprehensive audits by firms like [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf), [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf), [Peckshield](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/14-01-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3.pdf), OpenZeppelin, SigmaPrime, and formal verification by [Certora](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/Certora/certora/Verification_Report.pdf). Currently, [AAVE v3](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) holds $51.6M DAI with an expected APY of 3.82%.



### 3. Deposit USDC on AAVE v3

Same logic as above but for USDC. As of the day of this writing, the total USDC supplied on [AAVE v3](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) is $299M, and the expected APY is 2.86%.



### 4. Deposit DAI on MakerDAO’s DAI Savings Rate (DSR) module

MakerDAO, renowned for creating DAI, is a leading DAO in the DeFi sector. A recent [DSR rate hike](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-2-non-scope-defined-parameter-changes-may-2023/20981) in May and the [introduction of eDSR](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-enhanced-dai-savings-rate-activation-spark-protocol-debt-ceiling-increase-rwa-vault-updates-avc-member-compensation-for-q2-2023-dao-resolution-for-monetalis-clydesdale-launch-project-funding-spark-proxy-spell-execution-august-2-2023) (enhanced DSR) in August make it an attractive strategy from a risk/reward perspective. Currently, eDSR offers an APR of 5%. By diversifying the Balancer treasury’s stablecoin allocation and capitalising on the higher yield offered by one of the most battle-tested protocols, the investment approach can be optimised.



### 5. Unstake stETH on Lido

Post the Shapella fork in April, users can now unstake or withdraw staked ETH from the different LST providers. This action was not part of the previous preset update request to the Balancer DAO due to its timing.



### 6. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Rocket Pool (rETH)

To diversify LST holdings, we suggest adding [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/) to the whitelist for ETH staking and unstaking. RocketPool ranks [third](https://dune.com/queries/2433350/3997605) in the liquid staking market, holding about 691,000 ETH, or 6% of the total market. In market share, Rocket Pool's rETH trails Lido's stETH (76%) and Coinbase's cbETH (11%). Despite slightly lower liquidity for rETH to ETH swaps on major DEXes, Balancer DAO treasury's allocated amount should face minimal slippage. For example, [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/liquidity) indicates a swap of ~5,700 rETH for ETH would have under 0.1% slippage. Currently, rETH offers an APR of 3.26%.



### 7. Swap on Cow Swap

Thanks to the efforts of the Gnosis Builders and the karpatkey tech team, Cow Swap can now be seamlessly integrated with the Zodiac Roles Modifier. This enhancement allows for the exclusive swapping of only those tokens that are included in the whitelisted strategies.",bullish,3.203,2023-09-27 19:31:57+00:00,3.383,3.383,2023-09-29 00:00:00+00:00,5.6197315017171405,3.3475,0.0451139556665626,0.8987419605255127,True,"1. Deposit USDC on AAVE v3: The total USDC supplied on AAVE v3 is $299M, and the expected APY is 2.86%.

2. Deposit DAI on MakerDAO’s Dai Savings Rate (DSR) module: MakerDAO offers an APR of 5% for DAI deposits in their DSR module. This could be a good strategy due to the recent rate hike and the introduction of eDSR.

3. Unstake stETH on Lido: After the Shapella fork in April, users can now unstake or withdraw staked ETH from Lido. This action was not part of the previous preset update request to the Balancer DAO due to its timing.

4. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Rocket Pool (rETH): To diversify LST holdings, consider adding RocketPool to the whitelist for ETH staking and unstaking. RocketPool holds about 691,000 ETH, or 6% of the total market, offering an APR of 3.26%.

Messari Protocol Services believes in the power and importance of transparency and education in DeFi. Protocols enable permissionless networks, and DAOs manage the parameters and designs of the protocol and related token. Both users and members of the DAO benefit from deep data research and communication. Messari PS hires and trains analysts to become a productive member of DAO communities and experts in the protocols they cover, enabling them to help surface key data and events to the largest distribution of crypto users, investors, and builders available. DeFi, and crypto in general, requires unbiased third parties to work with communities to surface transparent, detailed, and digestible information about the protocol and DAO. Messari PS is the leading provider for that solution.

For an update from our [prior proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-commission-quarterly-financial-reports-through-the-messari-hub/2318), as a company Messari has 3x our headcount with a team of over 150 after raising a Series B led by Brevan Howard Digital. We’ve used that to significantly scale our research, data science, and engineering resources to build out our quarterly reporting and research capabilities. This has enabled us to bring all of our research in-house so we can have dedicated sector-specific analysts assigned to each protocol to cover them each quarter and continue to build up expertise.

We have become core subgraph developers for The Graph and are building out open-source data infrastructure that feeds into our quarterly reports and live data dashboards.

Lastly, we have been working extensively on growing our distribution and have signed deals to redistribute quarterly reports with Bloomberg, S&P Global, and Refinitiv three of the largest tradfi research platforms in the world.

**Proposal Breakdown**:

Quarterly Reporting

We will produce 4 quarterly reports following the same cadence released shortly after the end of the fiscal quarter. These will break down major KPIs and fundamental metrics such as:

* Aggregate stats - protocol revenue, veBAL distribution, BL incentives, operating margins
* Dex metrics - trading volume, liquidity, new pools
* LP metrics - LP fees, annualized yield

We will look at these from both the macro level and on a more granular level from individual pool level data and network deployments. The data will come from the publicly available subgraphs and Dune dashboards we’ve built.

Data Analytics

We’ve already released freely available [data dashboards](https://messari.io/protocol/balancer-v2) showing many of the metrics included in the quarterly reports. We plan to extend this by building an advanced LP analytics page showing:

* Pool rankings based on
  * Liquidity, trading volume, revenue, capital efficiency, revenue/$ of TVL
* Profitability calculator
  * Pool returns split out by swap fees and reward emissions
* Backtesting of different LP positions
* Simulating future returns
* Help user in finding best pools based on their LP profile
  * Shortlist pools to LP on based on LP profile and preferences
  * Track performance of LP positions over time
  * Compare across different deployments and different pools

Governance Analysis

* A Bi-Annual Governance Report
  * Messari will create bi-annual reports to analyze key governance KPIs and metrics and a detailed look into governance structure, process, dynamics, and analysis. (ex: [Optimism](https://messari.io/report/state-of-optimism-governance?referrer=all-research))
  * Details include:
    * Introduction
      * Balancer Structure and Process Updates.
    * Quantitative Analysis
      * veBAL Distribution.
      * Power Dynamics (Voter blocs, whales, voter history, etc.)
      * Proposal Analysis (Proposal history, success rate, participation metrics, categorization, etc.).
    * Qualitative Analysis
      * Governance Design
        * Structure/Process Analysis.
        * Quorum Analysis.
        * Exploration of governance opportunities.
      * Proposal Analysis
        * Highlight of contentious proposals or noteworthy governance events.
    * Conclusion
* Retainer for a Balancer Governor Note
  * A 1500-3000 word proposal-specific analysis designed to educate stakeholders on the impacts of important DAO proposals.

**Key Objectives & Success Metrics**:

1. Surfacing on-chain metrics and protocol developments

Crypto has a glaring lack of sufficient long-form research and analytics. While there are various analytics dashboards, blog posts, and messaging channels to distill information, it is still cumbersome to have a strong understanding of the on-chain activity and important protocol-level developments. This creates a high barrier to making informed decisions as a stakeholder, leading to a misallocation of resources, both time and money, since there are investors, developers, and users that are not acting with the full breadth of knowledge at their disposal.

These services will inform various stakeholders through recurring, data-driven research from trusted, independent analysts. The actionable insights generated from these reports will better educate these stakeholders on the economic, financial, and social health of Balancer.

2. Growth

Not only are we creating these reports but we’re ensuring they get sent out to a wide audience that can consume them. This is done through Messari’s channels of 300,000 crypto-natives, which reach most of the active builders and investors in the industry as well as through our distribution through some of the largest traditional research platforms in the world:

Bloomberg Terminal: 325,000 users

S&P Global Capital IQ: 12,000 enterprises

Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters): 40,000 enterprises and 400,000 users

This goes a long way to further professionalize Balancer to the vast majority of major funds, banks, financial service companies, and large corporations in the world that will better grasp the magnitude of economic activity generated by the protocol. There are trillions of dollars in AUM represented by these platforms so even a small percentage of users consuming this information and acting on it can drive meaningful activity to the protocol.

*A note on success metrics. Given the nature of this proposal, it can be difficult to directly attribute benefits. For example, you can have institutional players consuming reports on Bloomberg and using that as a key part of their diligence to allocate capital however its not possible to say $x of liquidity or investment came in as a result of Messari Research. While we know this is happening anecdotally we can’t tangibly measure it.

**Length of Engagement & Budget**:

edit: We propose the base quarterlies option for the current cycle:

$80k for 1 year
a. 4 Quarterly reports
b. at least one tweet on each quarterly report
c. AMA with the DAO on SP calls about quarterly take-aways and inspo for new analysis
d. Open sourcing our BAL report and model
 

Payment can be made in stablecoins or BAL based on market price at time of payment (in which case there will be a 5% premium to account for additional costs of accepting native tokens)

In both cases the funds will go towards:

* Research - Our analysts spend several weeks each report along with an extensive internal editing and review process by the broader team.
* Data Science and Engineering - Each report will have its own dedicated data science and engineering resources tasked with providing all the relevant raw data.
* Distribution - We have several members of the team working on distribution for these reports across all of Messari’s channels along with the third-party partners.

2. Wide distribution of these reports to a large audience of stakeholders including crypto-natives, major funds, banks, financial service companies, and large corporations.
3. Professionalizing Balancer by showcasing its economic activity to the global financial industry.

The proposal includes:
- Qualitative Analysis: Governance Design (Structure/Process Analysis, Quorum Analysis, Exploration of governance opportunities) and Proposal Analysis (Highlight of contentious proposals or noteworthy governance events).
- A 1500-3000 word proposal-specific analysis designed to educate stakeholders on the impacts of important DAO proposals.
- Quarterly reports, tweets, AMAs with the DAO, and open sourcing of BAL report and model.

The budget for this engagement is $80k for 1 year, payable in stablecoins or BAL based on market price at time of payment (with a 5% premium to account for additional costs). The funds will go towards research, data science and engineering, and distribution efforts.

**Summary:**

This is a proposal to enable uncapped Balancer gauge for instETH/wstETH pool on Optimism.

**Protocol Description:**

InceptionLRT is an omnichain liquid restaking protocol offering both Native and Isolated restaking to users. Powered by the Flash Unstake mechanism and supported by node operators with DVT Technology, InceptionLRT aims to become the most complete liquid restaking protocol in DeFi. The isolated architecture combined with the flash unstake feature solves the only drawback of isolated LRTs - liquidity fragmentation! instETH is the isolated LRT that users get by depositing stETH.

stETH is a rebase token by Lido that also represents staked ether but instead of the exchange rate accumulation method, the staking rewards are given as extra stETH. Effectively, stETH always stays pegged 1:1 with ETH and stETH token balances are updated when the oracle reports the change in the total (initial deposit + staking rewards) every day. wstETH is the wrapped version of regular stETH which allows for stETH accumulation in the contract and turns the rebase model of stETH into the C-token model of other LSTs.

**Motivation:**

Substantially increase the liquidity of instETH on Optimism.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** ING holders participate in decision-making, influencing the protocol’s direction and policies, including the Node Operators, AVSs and restaking strategies.

2. **Oracles:**

[wstETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xef42D000a3e85C4e71C57e2C6A1E600e86f5a91B)

3. **Audits:**

InceptionLRT undergoes security audits and checks to ensure the safety of user funds. Latest: https://docs.inceptionlrt.com/security/audit-reports

4. **Centralization vectors:**

The InceptionLRT Litepaper introduced the vision for Inception as a decentralized system where independent node operators work to power the growth and development of Web3.

5. **Market History:**

Market history and protocol information can be found here: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/inception-steth

6. **Value:**

The pool is intended to be a major source of liquidity for instETH on Optimism and allow for a healthy stimulation of volume.

## I. Introduction

This proposal aims to outline how the funding and accountability process will work for any entity wishing to contribute to the Balancer ecosystem. To recap the journey so far, in early 2022 [subDAO’s were formed](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66) to give community contributors a formalized structure with clearly defined domains. More recently, the DAO has chosen to [incorporate a foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x357877d9d3d121e929f66cad2349987fc658be449585f8d021319b69a3a0e620) in order to engage with service providers who require formal contracts.

This framework aims to deliver the following benefits:

* Streamlined process for funding service providers
* Clear and decentralized accountability mechanisms
* Creation of a delegate system to enable a transparent dialogue between proposers and large token holders

## II. Process for Funding Service Providers

A service provider (“SP”) is an entity with a budget attached to it, managed by one or more Leaders, that coordinate and pay contributors working to achieve one or more long term goals in the Balancer Ecosystem. When choosing to pursue funding as a SP or through the Grants program, a rough guideline is short term or one off engagements requiring $100k or less should go through Grants. A longer term engagement or one with a cost beyond $100k should be pursued as a SP.

To keep things simple, the terms “service provider”, “working group”, and “subDAO” are considered synonyms and interchangeable. A SP can be an incorporated legal entity or simply a loosely organized group of anonymous Balancer contributors. In order to interface with the Foundation a legal agreement is required so any SP taking advantage of the Foundation must be a legal entity or a natural person.

SP's have an option to make their funding proposal through the Foundation. If it is made through the Foundation, the Foundation will create the funding proposal on the forum on behalf of the SP. The SP is expected to answer any community questions or concerns raised on the forum. Funding will be distributed to the Foundation’s wallet on a quarterly basis and from there distributed to the SP on a defined monthly basis. If the SP does not go through the Foundation then funding will be distributed directly to the SP on a quarterly basis.

*All funding proposals must include “Domains of Operation” and “Key Objectives”.*

### II.1 Domains of Operation

Examples of Domains might be core protocol development, partner integrations, marketing, business development, front end, community, etc. While some overlap is acceptable (multiple SP’s operating in the same Domains) it is generally not an effective use of DAO funds to have multiple marketing teams or multiple teams managing the community for example. Clearly indicating Domains of Operation and the expertise an SP brings to that Domain will reduce inefficient overlap and help to increase coordination in the event of necessary or useful overlap. Having multiple SP’s building front ends might represent a useful overlap, for example.

Each SP should make clear how they will handle record keeping and the handover of those records in the event they are offboarded. If an SP proposes to enter a domain of operation already occupied by another approved SP, the proposal should outline how they plan to coordinate efforts to avoid the DAO paying double for the same work. It is expected that the work product of each SP is made available to the community on a regular basis.

### II.2 Key Objectives

Key Objectives should be high level goals the SP plans to work towards and accomplish during the funding period. If appropriate, these might be broken down into a list of specific tasks. It is important that the DAO have a clear idea of what the SP is doing while also leaving enough flexibility for innovation and efficiency. Providing success metrics will also ensure the community can easily evaluate performance.

Finally, a brief overview of how the funds would be spent is the last requirement. In the event of an SP requiring additional funds before the end of the funding period a supplemental budget request can be made in the same format as a regular funding request. An estimate of the SP’s monthly spend should be included which will be used to calculate the quarterly distribution of funds.

*All SP’s going through the Foundation must upload a copy of their “Service Level Agreement” or SLA to ipfs and include the link in their funding proposal.*

## III. Accountability Mechanisms

We must ensure any funds disbursed from the DAO treasury are used transparently and in service of the Balancer Ecosystem. Ultimately veBAL holders are responsible for ensuring SP’s are delivering enough value to justify the cost of funding them. We propose the following rules for holding SP’s accountable:

* All SP’s must hold monthly community calls in any online venue of their choosing as long as it is open to the public. Failure to hold a monthly call will prevent the Foundation or the DAO from disbursing future funds. The recordings of these community calls must stay available for at least 3 months after the community call has wrapped up.
* In combination with the monthly community call, a monthly summary must also be created which details progress towards each “Key Objective” outlined by the SP in their funding proposal. This should be posted to Balancer’s forum in advance of the monthly community call.
* Anyone can make a forum proposal to the DAO to stop the Foundation/DAO from disbursing future funds to the SP. Such a proposal should include: SP in question, reason to halt funding, supporting evidence, and any other comments.
* If the vote passes, all future funding to that SP will be halted until a new funding proposal is successfully approved. If it fails, funding continues as normal.
* There will be an internal monthly meeting with mandatory attendance by at least one representative of every actively funded SP. The goal of this meeting is to ensure all SP’s are strategically aligned across the ecosystem. Ideally each SP should keep their representative the same month to month.

Every member of Balancer’s community shares responsibility for ensuring SP’s that receive funding from the treasury are acting in the best interest of the Balancer ecosystem. The rules outlined above empower every community member to act if they feel an SP is no longer acting in that best interest. The Foundation is an agent of the DAO and must honor the outcome of any legitimate snapshot vote, subject to any applicable Laws/Acts and Regulations.

## IV. Contribution Funding Pathways
 
![486b132175a0785b857c6da537b78f149eafd618_2_624x339.png](ipfs://QmQWtsoMzcvCBcu4WxMQLo2Bb9V48k2gn72pnkNgUik1ee)
    
## V. Delegate System

While anyone can initiate a proposal to stop funding a SP it is large veBAL holders who have the strongest incentive to ensure SP’s are delivering value. The creation of a delegate system will lead to a more transparent and productive dialogue between proposers and those with large voting power. We encourage anyone interested in being a delegate to present their platform to the community in the new “[Delegate Citadel](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)” section of the forum.

## VI. Voting

Delegates and token holders should not vote in favor to fund or against to defund a SP that they are working for or affiliated with. Additionally, SP’s should not compensate token holders monetarily in exchange for their votes (do not bribe on funding or defunding proposals).

There will be a third voting option added to snapshot to cover the case of a SP being affiliated with many large veBAL holders and thus failing to pass a proposal to fund them because so much voting power cannot vote in good faith. For each SP funding proposal, there will be “Yes”, “No”, and “Abstain”. It is expected that delegates and any token holders with a potential conflict of interest regarding a particular SP will only vote for “Abstain” if they choose to vote at all and provide the reason for doing so.

## VII. Risk Assessment

There are various risks to the ecosystem that could arise from the adoption of this proposal.

* A veBAL token holder might work for a SP (or the SP might have holdings of veBAL itself) and vote in favor of funding the SP despite this conflict of interest.
* A SP might get funded and not follow through on their key objectives. With funds sent on a quarterly basis, this could result in a sizable loss of funds.
* Balancer sees multiple SP funding requests and if all were funded this would represent an unsustainable burn rate.

The way to mitigate these risks is to foster an active and engaged community. Conflicts of interest should be declared up front to prevent any appearance of impropriety. Unknown or new SP’s might want to request a lower funding amount and/or utilize milestone based payments as a trial period. If milestone based payments are utilized they should be overseen by the Grants Service Provider. Delegates and those community members who handle management of treasury funds should speak up about the impact funding SP’s will have on the treasury - and it is a good idea for each SP to include their assessment of that impact in their proposal if they can.

The responsibility for stewarding the Balancer ecosystem towards a bright future lies with veBAL holders and delegates. We could try to create many rules to address many possible scenarios but we see value in creating a simple and flexible framework for funding all kinds of Balancer contributors.

## VIII. Specification

If this proposal passes, the following will be in effect:

* Any future funding proposals must adhere to the guidelines as described above. **Please find an [example template here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/how-to-create-a-funding-proposal/3233)**.
* The Ops subDAO will dissolve at the end of the second quarter. After salaries are paid for June, any remaining funds will be returned to the DAO Multisig. All powers held by Ops will return to veBAL governance.
* This proposal will mark the start of a new tracking system, BIP or Balancer Improvement Proposal.

The community shares responsibility for ensuring SPs (Strategy Providers) that receive funding from the treasury act in the best interest of the Balancer ecosystem.

2. Any community member can raise concerns if they feel an SP is not acting in the best interest, and the Foundation as the DAO's agent must honor the outcome of any legitimate snapshot vote, subject to applicable laws and regulations.

3. Contribution funding pathways are outlined for supporting various aspects of the Balancer ecosystem.

4. A delegate system is proposed to facilitate transparent and productive dialogue between proposers and large veBAL holders, who have a strong incentive to ensure SPs deliver value.

5. Delegates and token holders should not vote in favor or against proposals for SPs they are working for or affiliated with, and SPs should not offer monetary compensation in exchange for votes.

6. A new ""Abstain"" voting option is added to cover cases where an SP has significant influence over large veBAL holders and may fail to pass a proposal due to conflicts of interest.

7. Risks associated with the ecosystem, such as potential conflicts of interest or unsustainable burn rates, are addressed by fostering an active and engaged community, declaring conflicts of interest upfront, and utilizing milestone-based payments for new or unknown SPs.

8. The Ops subDAO will dissolve at the end of the second quarter, with any remaining funds returned to the DAO Multisig. All powers held by Ops will return to veBAL governance.

9. A new tracking system, BIP or Balancer Improvement Proposal, is introduced for proposals added to snapshot, with each proposal being given a unique BIP number. This proposal is designated as BIP-1.",bullish,small

**Summary:**

> This pool uses the [ComposableStablePoolFactory-v3](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdba127fbc23fb20f5929c546af220a991b5c6e01#readContract) and is composed of two [Gearbox](https://gearbox.fi/#provide-capital) linear pools. The underlying tokens are USDC and DAI. These will each be wrapped through Gearbox's capital provision market to earn LPs additional yield. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. The gauge can be uncapped based on the contents being all large cap stable tokens. Gearbox's diverse lending market permits users to borrow for several use cases making the lending market lucrative and beneficial for Balancer LP's to tap into. Gearbox also allows for lending of various other assets and given this initial case this opens the opportunity for more to come in the future.

**Protocol Description:**

> Gearbox is a fully composable leverage protocol where users can provide liquidity as a lender for yield. This is where the boosted source of yield is delivered to the wrapped portion of tokens in this pool. On the opposite side of Gearbox's market, users borrow assets in order to leverage up in various Defi protocols to participate in farms, and function is a ""risk-on"" style of investing. USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO.

**Motivation:**

> Balancer’s ability to increase capital efficiency using linear and boosted pools is taking shape across the protocol. This Gearbox boosted pool fits Balancer’s initiative to be a protocol where LPs can safely tap into external yield sources, while maintaining effective liquidity for swapping. This will earn both LPs and the DAO yield and provide Idle with a place for their wrapped tokens to easily be swapped and deposited as the pool increases in TVL.

**Specifications:**

1. **Governance:** USDC are centralized and does not have a governance forum. DAI is collateralized by MakerDAO. Gearbox's governance details can be seen [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/governance/setup).
2. **Oracles:** This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned.
3. **Audits:** See Gearbox's [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/risk-and-security/audits-bug-bounty)
4. **Centralization vectors:** USDC is inherently centralized.
5. **Market History:** See USDC [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/%5D(https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin)). and Gearbox [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gearbox).
6. **Value:** LPs & Balancer will earn the protocol fee on underlying bb-g-USD as well as swap fees. BIP-19 will incentivize TVL to continue to grow here with trading volume and this implementation will continue to draw in new volume, as well as showcase the power of these pool types.

## Protocol Description:

Inverse Finance is a community of crypto enthusiasts organized as a DAO and started on December 26th 2020. Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.

Inverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;

* On the supply side of money markets, such as DAO-owned protocol FiRM, by Inverse Finance’s “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.
* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA/FraxBP through our Convex Fed, DOLA/USDC on Velodrome, and previously DOLA/bb-a-USD on Balancer.
* Via purchase with DAI stablecoin using The Stabilizer.

DOLA is not “algorithmic” and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.

## Motivation:

This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the DOLA/USDC stable pool. Inverse has previously obtained a veBAL gauge for the [INV/DOLA](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x0678e2094fa6b3adf61e319c3000b6080f84d43d7555552510dfd2949fa8c4c0) 50-50 pool and DOLA/bb-a-USD 50-50 on Balancer and this proposal aims to build on this momentum. Following the recent unwinding of the DOLA/bb-a-USD LP due to a vulnerability with the implementation of our pool with the bb-a-USD pool; we are once again looking to build deep DOLA liquidity on Balancer. Platform BAL incentives would also help deepen DOLA liquidity as we seek to further alleviate our dependence on the Curve ecosystem for DOLA liquidity. If approved, we expect to continue what was previously done for DOLA-bb-a-USD for our new veBAL gauge and are in coordination with various bribing platforms to facilitate the incentivization and drive the Balancer bribe market narrative.

The Inverse Finance Team plans to continue being a major adopter of Balancer technology and bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Once the DOLA/USDC stable pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would once again begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer.

## Specifications:

You can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.

Governance:

Inverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to pools such as the DOLA/FraxBP[ Curve](https://curve.fi/factory/27) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.

Oracles:

Inverse Finance’s new fixed-rate money market, FiRM, uses Chainlink price oracle for its wETH market. Inverse Finance’s old lending market relied on both Chainlink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable.

Audits:

As part of our renewed smart-contract review process, Inverse Finance hosted [a bug bounty contest](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-10-inverse-finance-contest/) on the Code4rena platform to conduct a comprehensive audit of our fixed rate lending protocol, FiRM. Inverse has also recently expanded its bug bounty program by [launching a vault](https://app.hats.finance/vaults) on the Hats.finance platform. FiRM contracts were also reviewed by boutique auditing firm DefiMoon, who have been our [official security partners](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/new-security-layer-a-welcome-to-the-defi-moon-team) during Q4. In addition to providing security consulting and auditing services for FiRM, DefiMoon has also played a role in our recent deployments of [FraxBP Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/66), [Aura Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/71), and [Velo Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/68). In the immediate aftermath of our price manipulation incident, Inverse had hired leading security firm PeckShield in Q3 to perform an audit of our renewed INV oracle, as well as our [bad debt repayment product](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/How%20Inverse%20Is%20Thinking%20Outside%20The%20Box%20on%20Frontier%20Debt%20Repayments). Their report can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWNG08mib2GcI1WqnMt5IdFoW73QU2F8/view).

The DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. An announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).

Centralization vectors:

Within the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:

* Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.
* Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.
* Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 9 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.
* Fed Chair: 2 of 6 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts.

Please see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).

Market History:

Inverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the “Feds”, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLA’s Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. Please see our graph below of DOLA’s peg YTD.

1051,1889,5236,5236,5236,2022-03-25 11:27:08+00:00,balancer,"This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-hand-over-swap-fee-and-amplification-factor-control-to-the-balancer-dao/2550).

# Motivation

For the last year, swap fees on the Balancer protocol have been controlled by Gauntlet [[1]](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-partners-with-gauntlet-to-make-dynamic-fee-pools-a-reality-97b3fb1760df). Gauntlet aims to quantitatively and algorithmically find the best swap fee configuration for a given pool and market conditions [[2]](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/balancer-v2-pools-trading-fee-methodology-7a65df671b8c). As the partnership is due for renewal February 17th the DAO is proposing to take over ownership, ultimately terminating the contract with Gauntlet.The DAO has analysed the situation and found several issues in favour of stopping Gauntlet swap fee control. Gauntlet has signalled that they will “sunset the Fee Optimization Product” and want to hand over the swap fee controller, therefore agreeing with our intention of transitioning control to the DAO.

To summarise the situation from the Balancer DAOs perspective, following issues led to the termination of the partnership:

* Gauntlet uses closed-source code - this is against the open-source spirit of Balancer
* We would expect a high cost of about 10-15k BAL per year to use their product
* The protocol swap fees have never really been algorithmically controlled but rather changes have been made with some sort of “unknown” methodology
* Manual intervention was needed
* Adjusting intervals were weeks, not days or hours - inacceptable for a system that has to react fast to market conditions

Based on these factors we propose to take over ownership of swap fee control to the treasury subDAO. We propose a multi-phase transition (see specifications) to achieve a fully automated system that anybody can contribute to.

# Risk assessment/mitigation

We anticipate minimal to no risk in handing over the swap fee control to the DAO. The multi-phase plan will guarantee that a reasonable swap fee control mechanism will be in place at some point. For the first iteration, the treasury subDAO will take ownership of a multisig setting swap fees. Even “harmful” configurations could be easily undone and assets would always stay safe.

Gas costs will be covered by the treasury funds. We do not expect high costs as these are non-complex operations on the swap fee controller.*emphasized text*

# Specification

## Phase 1: handing over fee control to DAO

In the first phase the subDAO takes over control of swap fee settings for all pools. The first iteration will manage pools manually. For simplicity, the fees will be tier-structured as follows:

### Tier system

|Tier|Pool type|Fee range|
| --- | --- | --- |
|1|Stable pools|<=0.01%|
|2|Standard and index pairs|<=0.1%|
|3|Ecosystem pairs (e.g. BAL/WETH 80/20)|>1% and <= 5%|
|4|Experimental pairs (e.g. hot coins)|>5%|

Explanation on the pairs and why those fees were chosen:

**Tier 1**: Stable pools need to have the lowest possible but still attractive fees for LPs to leverage trading routes with major integrators. Therefore fees for this tier are set as low as possible. Gauntlet claimed that they increased our Stab3l pool performance with their analytical mechanisms. However, this modification was done manually after consultation with a DAO member [[3]](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/balancer-optimizes-capital-efficiency-and-doubles-lp-revenue-using-gauntlet-865584bcca2a).

**Tier 2**: Standard pools and index pairs will have a max. standard swap fee of <0.1% but will usually range around 0.0.025% and 0.05%. This is in line with competing protocols that charge around 0.05% for pools like WBTC/WETH and WETH/STABLE pools

**Tier 3**: Pairs containing BAL tokens should have fees >1% as this would greatly improve rewards for liquidity providers as well as the treasury. We argue that setting ecosystem fees to such a high number should not have any immediate effect as other incentives, such as the upcoming veBAL [[4]](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x9fe19c491cf90ed2e3ed9c15761c43d39fd1fb732a940aba8058ff69787ee90a) system guarantee that BAL liquidity stays within the protocol

**Tier 4**: Swap fees for experimental or other ecosystem pairs can go up as high as 5-10%. An example are the element.fi pools that are currently set at 10%

## Phase 2: dynamic control by the treasury subDAO

The specifications for phase 2 are not fully set. A possibility is to assign a group of multisig signers that can adjust swap fee percentages “on the fly” as they see fit. This implementation would have the advantage that we could quickly adjust fee structures based on market conditions and / or other factors like partnerships.

## Phase 3: fully automated control with strategically fixed values

The ultimate goal is to replace the closed-source gauntlet algorithm with our own implementation. We want an open-source and well documented system where anybody can contribute and improve upon. The new system should adjust swap fees based on clearly defined parameters and should be able to react quickly - so that we do not end up with a weekly fee update as it is currently done by Gauntlet. Other protocols have successfully introduced dynamic fee control based on market conditions [[5]](https://blog.synthetix.io/dynamic-exchange-fees-explained/).

## Additional delegation power: setting amplification factors

Governance has delegated to Gauntlet the power to set not only swap fees but also the amplification factor of stable and metastable pools. All of these permissions need to be handed over to some other party or revoked. We propose to also hand over the control of the amplification factor to the Balancer DAO, as Gauntled was so kind to hand over ownership of their Gnosis safe.

# Implementation
## Implementation for Swap Fee Control

Fee controllers for each chain will be set as follows:

|Chain|Controller|Change|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mainnet | [Gauntled controller contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4a8ed6c1d8d048bd29a00946bfcf2db10e7923b/advanced#writeContract) | Yes - hand over control, add new signers|

As seen in the table above, only for mainnet a change has to be initiated as follows:
Gauntled offered to hand over the ownership of their fee setter contract at https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4a8ed6c1d8d048bd29a00946bfcf2db10e7923b/advanced#writeContract
for mainnet. The signers of the Liquidity mining distribution safe at https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860/settings/owners will be added to the above mentioned contract. These are:

## Implementation for Amplification Factor Control

* No action is required by the governance multisig in any network.
* The set of owners of Gauntlet’s Gnosis Safe (0xf4a80929163c5179ca042e1b292f5efbbe3d89e6) will be modified to the following list of addresses:
  * 0x1b004189e64d5b2F71d5Be554470E6c49e10123B
  * 0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3
  * 0x58Ff691f7849b0666085CFb693568160Cfb9d22D

  * 0xc4591c41e01a7a654B5427f39Bbd1dEe5bD45D1D

These are the same signers currently in charge of the Liquidity mining distribution safe at [0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860/settings/owners).

## Summary

The Balancer DAO has locked its vested AURA into vlAURA with [[BIP-481]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-481-claim-and-lock-balancer-dao-aura-allocation-into-vlaura/5319). The first lock of 1.42m AURA will expire and can be relocked after March 7th and before the unlolck date of March 14th, 2024:

 
![bip-551.png](ipfs://bafkreigqscbntq3fhxjxnaicwwfro3tn7zzntkhpp4ecec25bd7c5z3bfi)
    

The DAO wishes to relock its current position and bundle it with an additional vest so the next unlock is bundled into one in 16 weeks from the relock date.

## Motivation

The Balancer DAO wishes to relock its vlAURA position to continue to vote for Balancer gauges with its position. To do so the DAO needs to relock its expired position timely after March 7th and before March 14th 2024

At the time of writing, the DAO is entitled again to roughly ~280k AURA tokens (can be verified by calling `available` with `_recipient` as `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` https://etherscan.io/address/0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422 ). Another ~297k AURA remains unvested and will be claimed at a later date.

We are proposing to initiate another lock with the available ~280k AURA to be used to vote on AURA governance. The specifics of the Balancer DAOs voting allocations can be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-508-utilize-locked-aura-to-support-ecosystem-growth/5419).

By re-locking the initial position and vesting additional AURA between March 7th and March 14th which would fall into the same locking epoch, it is guaranteed that the entirety of the locks will be up for re-lock in 16 weeks, reducing load on the multi-sig, streamlining the management of this position.

## Specification

The Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the vlAURA contract at `0x3fa73f1e5d8a792c80f426fc8f84fbf7ce9bbcac` and call `processExpiredLocks` with argument `true` - The execution needs to be timed AFTER March 7th and BEFORE March 14th

Additionally, the DAO multisig on mainnet `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call the `claim` function on the AuraVestedEscrow at `0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422` with the parameter `_lock` set to `true`.

This move aims to streamline the management of this position by ensuring all locks will be up for re-lock in 16 weeks, reducing load on the multi-sig.

# Abstract

As part of the [veBAL tokenomics upgrade](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512) 75% of protocol revenues are to be paid out to veBAL holders in bb-a-USD. An undesirable side effect of this is the protocol liquidating a significant amount of BAL tokens collected as fees. This proposal suggests that these BAL tokens should be paid out to veBAL holders directly on top of the 10% of BAL emissions they receive.

# Motivation

It was noted in the veBAL proposal that there would need to be some consolidation of the tokens collected before paying those fees out to veBAL holders:

""Given Balancer protocol is permissionless and meant to have thousands of pools, fees are going to be collected in potentially thousands of different tokens. Some type of consolidation will be necessary for the fees to be claimable by veBAL holders in a meaningful, gas-efficient way. The fee consolidation prior to distribution will initially be handled by the treasury subDAO, but should be replaced in the near future by a fully decentralized smart contract implementation, akin to Curve’s burner contracts[[12]](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html)"" - Fernando


It was decided that protocol fees should be paid out in the bb-a-USD token, however we can see that a significant portion of the protocol fees collected recently were in the form of BAL tokens.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wI4YLCUvIdupofwgSwKDeP-6vYCUdd02WRvkTjgEJgY/edit#gid=0

As we want to incentivise veBAL holders to reinvest into their veBAL position, it's counterproductive to preemptively sell these tokens into stablecoins and it would instead be preferable to pay out BAL directly.

The addition of BAL as a token for which to pay out protocol fees is unique in that 10% of BAL emissions are reserved for veBAL holders and these funds are distributed through the same mechanism as the protocol fees. **It then causes no extra complexity or gas costs for veBAL holders to pay out a portion of the protocol fees in BAL tokens.**

# Specification

- The Treasury subDAO shall exclude any BAL collected from being liquidated to bb-a-USD and use it to supplement the existing BAL emissions paid to veBAL holders.
- Any future tokens collected which are primarily paired against BAL (e.g. auraBAL by way of the 80/20 BPT, etc.) would be liquidated to BAL rather than bb-a-USD.",bullish,15.08,2022-04-18 21:28:47+00:00,16.07,16.07,2022-04-19 00:00:00+00:00,6.56498673740053,15.945,0.0573607427055703,0.8863091170787811,True," The text discusses a proposal to modify Balancer's protocol fees distribution, suggesting that instead of converting collected BAL tokens into stablecoins (bb-a-USD), they should be directly paid out to veBAL holders. This change aims to incentivize reinvestment and reduce gas costs for veBAL holders. The unique aspect is that BAL is already a token reserved for veBAL holders, making the additional distribution of protocol fees in BAL tokens less complex.",bullish,small
1054,1896,5262,5262,5262,2023-01-12 14:59:13+00:00,balancer,"**Summary:**

> This pool uses the metastable pool factory and contains two liquid staking derivatives of ethereum, cbETH and wstETH. The reason for this pool deployment is to replace the composable stable pool implementation of this pairing with a pool which Balancer can continue to collect the fees on properly. Due to the activation of recovery mode, the current pool is being streamed BAL incentives without the DAO being properly compensated for the fees the pool generates. This proposal will effectively activate this new pool's gauge and kill the current pool's gauge to foster migration of liquidity to the preferred pool.

**Protocol Description:**

> cbETH is Coinbase's liquid staking derivative for ethereum, while wstETH is Lido's wrapped staking derivative as featured in many other Balancer pools. 

**Motivation:**

> Described in the summary, the protocol can collect fees on the metastable pool and not the composable stable pool. Moving the incentives will motivate the liquidity providers to migrate their liquidity to the better pool option for Balancer.

**Introduction**
Whitelist the VitaDAO Gnosis Safe multisig, to vote-lock the B-80BAL-20WETH owned by the VitaDAO community into veBAL and participate in governance for the Balancer DAO, and vote on increased rewards for the Vita<>ETH pools.

**Motivation**
VitaDAO is a community DAO funding longevity research, and is a big fan and longer-term collaborator with Balancer, having its main liquidity pools listed with Balancer, and incentivising them with $vita rewards.

**Risks**
VitaDAO multisig signers recognise the risk of allowing smart contacts to vote-lock veBAL, and commits to not using this safe for tokenizing veBAL. We understand that doing so will likely prompt the removal of the safe’s address from the AllowList.

**Protocol Description:**

> Ethereum Liquid Staking as provided by Ankr Staking offers instant liquidity for your staked ETH, enabling you to connect your ankrETH tokens with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards.
> ankrETH is a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 ankrETH token vs. ETH increases over time as staking rewards accumulate.

**Motivation:**

> The purpose of this proposal is to allow this pool to qualify for BAL incentive distribution in order to deepen the liquidity on Balancer and allow for users to swap ankrETH, the ETH Liquid Staking Asset, for ETH with the help of Auto-bribes on hidden hand.
> The intuition behind this is to remedy the capital inefficiency associated with providing liquidity since ankrETH is generating a yield from the Staking Rewards of ETH. As a result, users have an opportunity cost when providing liquidity since the other half of the ETH they provide does not generate any yield.
> Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to utilize BAL incentives,Swap Fees and auto-bribes in order to mitigate this capital inefficiency effect.

**Protocol Description:**

>Olympus is a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain with the goal of establishing OHM as a crypto-native reserve currency. It conducts autonomous and dynamic monetary policy, with market operations supported by the protocol-owned Olympus Treasury.
>
>OHM serves a need in the market gap between fiat stable coins and volatile crypto assets, providing relative stability and scalability underpinned by the protocol’s Range Bound Stability (“RBS”) system. RBS is the flagship system of Olympus’ autonomous monetary policy and has resulted in [low volatility and stability](https://dune.com/spoysp/ohm-volatility) for OHM since its launch.

**Motivation:**

>Olympus currently has multiple large pools on Balancer, most notably the OHM/ETH and OHM/DAI pools on Mainnet and OHM/ETH and OHM/USDC pools on Arbitrum. These pools drive significant value to veBAL holders, both through fees earned as well as third parties pairing against OHM to route into these pools (e.g. BTRFLY, FDT, BOND, PAL). It is our intention to keep growing the number and size of OHM pools with new partners and we want to continue to host these pools on Balancer.
>
>A few months ago, Olympus DAO launched a new product launch, and deployed a OHM/wstETH pool on Balancer in cooperation with Lido. The newly launched product is a novel liquidity solution that allows for effective scaling of select LSDs and stable coins in an OHM pair. In a nutshell, this liquidity vault accepts third party deposits of LSDs or stable coins and mints an equivalent amount of protocol-owned OHM against this as a counter asset. The OHM side of the LP does not accrue any rewards, so it cuts down the incentivization costs by half for partners.

Hello friends, Ballers, and Balancer community!

We are [SymmetricDAO](https://symmetric.finance/), a Balancer fork currently of v1 (launching v2 in the next few weeks) deployed on Gnosis Chain and Celo. We are big fans of what Balancer has brought to innovate the world of decentralized finance and want to see the protocol expand.

Quick Summary
- We believe in the friendly fork model and aim to share economics, knowledge, and network with the BalancerDAO.

- We are experienced with the Balancer protocol, having successfully run a Balancer V1 fork on two chains for over 9 months.

- Being an early builder in the xDAI (now Gnosis) ecosystem and having completed a Celo-native Incubator, we are considered a “ Chain native project” on both xDAI and Gnosis. We have strong relationships with builders and the wider community on both chains.

- We propose Symmetric becomes the first official friendly fork on Celo and Gnosis Chain.

- SymmetricDAO is willing to offer 20000 SYMM (6.9% of circulating supply | 4% of max supply) instantly and offers BalancerDAO the ability to earn approximately 7.5% of the max supply if it actively LPs in Symmetric V2.0.

- We request 10,000 BAL to seed liquidity for 50% SYMM <> 50% BAL pools on Symmetric V2.0 and Balancer on Mainnet. In addition, we request a strategic grant of $100K USDC to fuel the further development and marketing of Symmetric V2.0.

- Once stable and mature on Celo and GnosisChain, SymmetricDAO is willing to lead/support complementary Friendly Fork deployments on alternative chains that the Balancer ecosystem aims to venture into.

Project Team

SymmetricDAO is a diverse and committed community that launched Symmetric Finance, a fork of Balancer V1.0, in June of 2021 on Gnosis Chain (then xDAI) and Celo in October 2021. The core team consists of the 3 project founders (2 Engineers and a Business Development Lead), two additional engineers, an ecosystem coordinator, and a marketer. Developers and other SymmetricDAO contributors support the core team. Our primary governance mechanism is Moloch V2.0 on Gnosis Chain, through which the Symm stakeholders align on initiatives by the DAO.

Background on the Friendly Fork
We’re just weeks away from launching Symmetric V2.0 (fork of Balancer V2.0) and have recently [partnered with PrimeDAO](https://twitter.com/PrimeDAO_/status/1504487724794867715) to collective bring their LBP, Rating & Deals technology to Celo & Gnosis; we think this is the perfect time to formalize the relationship between Symmetric and BalancerDAO.

Besides partnering with PrimeDAO, we are also (with success) re-engaging both Celo and Gnosis Chain to increase the ecosystem support and native token rewards allocated to Symmetric. We have already secured ~1M in ecosystem resources and liquidity rewards for Symmetric V2.0 and aim to request more once if and when this Balancer Friendly Fork proposal passes.

Our vision is to become the number one liquidity protocol on Celo and Gnosis chain by pro-actively building an ecosystem of DAOs and services around our Balancer Friendly Fork deployment.

We propose Symmetric becomes the first official friendly fork on Celo and Gnosis Chain.

Commitment of the Organizations
Both parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following:

SymmetricDAO

* To issue 20000 SYMM (7.1% of circulating supply | 4% of max supply) instantly and offers BalancerDAO the ability to earn approximately 7.5% of the max supply if it actively LPs in Symmetric V2.0.
* To create, maintain and incentivize SYMM <> BAL liquidity pools on Symmetric V2.0 (both Celo and Gnosis Network) and Balancer Protocol on mainnet.
* To support the development of the Balancer Protocol and subsequent Balancer Friendly forks.

BalancerDAO

* To acknowledge Symmetric as the first Balancer Friendly Fork on Celo and Gnosis Chain.
* To send 10,000 BAL to SymmetricDAO to be used to bootstrap SYMM <> BAL liquidity on Celo, Gnosis Chain, and Mainnet.
* To issue a 100,000 USDC Grant to Symmetric for further development and expansion.

To get the most out of the Friendly fork, both DAOs also agree to:
Co-marketing
- To ensure both entities will profit from each other's reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where applicable.

Knowledge and research sharing
- To share the latest technical insights about the Balancer protocol and collaborate on a joint ecosystemic technical roadmap. The DAOs will also support each other when collectively engaging third parties for mutual benefits.

Friendly Fork Agreement
If accepted by the Governance process of both DAOs, this friendly fork will start effective immediately. There is no expiry date to the agreement; however, both DAOs can override this Friendly Fork agreement through their governance process to remove the Friendly Fork title and rides with a one-month notice period.

Symmetric's ETH Address for their $100,000 and 10,000 BAL is 0x3d70E1b46FFC3B1b4ed72Ec1F56a747D33902210",bullish,12.56,2022-03-25 11:25:30+00:00,14.1,14.1,2022-03-27 00:00:00+00:00,12.26114649681528,13.42,0.0684713375796177,0.8044928908348083,True," The text presents a proposal from SymmetricDAO, a Balancer fork currently on Gnosis Chain and Celo, to establish a friendly relationship with the BalancerDAO.

## Introduction
For those who don’t know, the Ballers are a group of long term community contributors to Balancer Protocol. This proposal will feature messages from the Ballers about their activities to give the community some context around analyzing the value of this proposal. Under the current framework the Baller program is being funded in three month increments. Our current round of funding is set to expire November 1st, 2021. Over the last few months, the program has grown significantly in member count and scope. Commensurate with this growth is an increase in the funding cost. Currently the Ballers operate with no hierarchy - it is up to each Baller to determine their level of “Ballery” (full or half or none) and their level of engagement.

I have taken the role of distributing the Ballery so I check in with each Baller every month to see what they’re up to and if they have any feedback/concerns. We’ve also adopted bi-weekly Baller Round Table meetings to better coordinate amongst ourselves. I asked each Baller to write up a bit about what they’ve been doing recently so the community has some context to frame the discussion around this proposal - note this was up to each Baller to determine if they wanted to write anything or not.

You can see the list of currently active Ballers [here](https://www.notion.so/63091677228841de9fa909139e60362f?v=a7852fc9da684a5a834934e5215edd6d). This is updated to be reflective of the next three months.

Notable changes compared to the previous three months: Tongnk is going from half Ballery to none as he’s primarily focused on grants where he’s directly compensated. Andrea, Mike B, and Xeonus are moving from half to full as the scale of their contributions have increased.

## Baller Active Roles & Contributions

Please see the forum post referenced at the top of this proposal. This section was too large to fit in the snapshot vote.

## Conclusion & Specification
With a proposed roster of thirteen active Ballers (five full, eight half) at the current rate of 500 BAL per month for full and 250 BAL per month for half with 60% fully unlocked after two years (1 year cliff, 1 year linear vesting) and 40% liquid immediately, the total cost of funding for the next three months is as follows.

1,800 BAL per month in liquid payments * 3 = 5,400 BAL
2,700 BAL per month in vested payments * 3 = 8,100 BAL

In addition, I request 300 BAL as a spending fund to reward notable community contributions and fund any small projects the Ballers might need funding for.

#### Total: 13,800 BAL

If approved, the ecosystem fund will distribute this amount to a wallet I control. The Ballers desire to re-use existing vesting contracts, so the vested amounts for each Baller would be fully released in October 2023. I will work with Mike McDonald to make a contract for any Baller who does not have an existing vesting contract with a fully vested date that matches the existing ones.",bullish,24.47,2021-10-26 14:37:02+00:00,26.41,26.41,2021-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,7.92807519411524,25.09,0.0253371475275848,0.8821938037872314,True," The text discusses a proposal to renew funding for a group of community contributors, known as Ballers, in Balancer Protocol.

Balancer began distributing POAPs back in August, making us one of the earliest adopters in DeFi. Through the connections I've made since then I was made aware of the upcoming Poapathon [https://www.poapathon.com/](https://www.poapathon.com/).

By sponsoring this event we send a message to the rapidly growing community around POAPs that Balancer believes in the future of the technology. We will get access to some of the top artists and designers in crypto. I anticipate a lot of positive PR around this event, which means positive PR for Balancer if we become a top sponsor. 

## Motivation

Community engagement is critically important to the growth of any crypto project. Adopting POAPs and starting the AMA series have been effective first steps but there is still a lot left to do. Sponsoring this event will solidify Balancer's leadership position in the POAP community - the connections/PR we'll generate could be very important in the future. I will do my best to create as much value for Balancer as possible through our sponsorship and welcome the help of any other Ballers who are interested. 

## Specification

You can see the sponsorship tiers [here](https://www.poapathon.com/sponsors). This event is still in the planning stage so some things could change. I consider this spend to fall under the Baller's discretionary fund so the result of the proposal would be reflected in the next distribution for the spending fund - whatever we spend here, I'll ask for less when we replenish the spending fund. We had 10 votes in favor of ""Whale"" sponsorship, all other responses got 0 in the forum poll.

On behalf of the Balancer community, I’d like to propose we include V2 trades in the BAL for Gas program.

## Proposal

The mechanics to determine eligible transactions and BAL amounts would be [the same as in V1](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-bal-for-gas/1437), except:
1. In addition to the Exchange Proxy, transactions sent to [the Vault](https://etherscan.io/address/0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8) would qualify for the program (the Exchange Proxy only connects trades to V1 pools)
2. The gas amount to be reimbursed for trades through the V2 Vault would be defined as:
    * 90,000 gas for transactions containing one swap
    * 140,000 gas for transactions containing two or more swaps.

As V2 goes live and we start collecting more data, we would possibly review those amounts and create specific tiers for transactions containing three or four swaps.

## Motivation

The BAL for Gas program has become an important mechanism for distributing Balancer protocol governance power to one of its widest user bases: traders. With the launch of Balancer V2, it is only fair that users who have their trades routed through V2 pools get the same treatment as those who go through V1.",bullish,64.771,2021-05-07 21:39:12+00:00,71.243,71.243,2021-05-08 00:00:00+00:00,9.99212610581895,67.9565,0.0491809606150901,0.9039932787418364,True," The text proposes extending the BAL for Gas program to include V2 trades in the Balancer community.

As more data is collected, potential adjustments may be made for transactions with three or four swaps. The aim is to fairly distribute Balancer protocol governance power to a wide user base, including V2 traders.",bullish,small

On behalf of the Balancer community, I’d like to propose significant modifications to the ongoing gas reimbursement campaign. We have heard some concerns that the campaign is confusing and that it isn’t clear how much BAL a user will receive for a given trade. During these times of network congestion and high gas costs, we want to provide everyone with an opportunity to trade on Balancer. With that in mind, it doesn’t seem fair to ask users to exercise blind faith and wait until “next Wednesday” to find out what they’ve earned from trading. We would like to make every effort to simplify the campaign and improve transparency; what you see is what you get, or at least as close as possible. We plan to accomplish this by removing various sources of uncertainty from the reimbursement calculations so that it is possible to get an estimate ahead of time and display it to the user at the time of trade submission.

# The Proposal
Allocate **30,000 BAL** from the Ecosystem Fund to the “BAL for Gas'' campaign. There is no fixed time period; the budget is consumed on a **first-come, first-served** basis. When the budget is exhausted, the campaign is suspended until it is replenished by BAL governance.

For **each eligible trade made through the Balancer Exchange Proxy**, award claimable BAL tokens to the trader. An eligible trade is a trade containing one or more eligible swaps, where an eligible swap is a **swap between any two tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json)**. Claims are made available at the [BAL claims interface](https://claim.balancer.finance/#/) on Wednesday (UTC time) following the close of the weekly period (00:00 UTC Monday - 23:59 UTC Sunday) in which the trade occurred.

The amount of gas to be reimbursed is predetermined by the number of eligible swaps within the transaction:

![table|690x185](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/dd83c24ba43bd36e91396a5b6296f4c92cc986c2.png)

For converting gas to BAL, use the **median gas price of the enclosing block** and the **BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko** closest to the block time.

# Motivation
The proposal above may seem familiar, but there are some very important distinctions between this and the previous reimbursement program. All modifications share the common goal of improving user experience, which we believe is a matter of simplification and transparency.

First, this proposed campaign makes no effort to account for the _actual_ expenses of the user. Both the amount of gas consumed by the transaction and the gas price ultimately paid are irrelevant. Instead, deterministic figures are favored: the amount of gas is fixed depending on the number of swaps, and the gas price is the block median, rather than the user’s own price. It is simply too difficult to accurately predict the parameters of a given transaction ahead of time, whereas it is much easier to predict block-wide parameters. Predictability informs transparency.

The second major shift pertains to the budget. The existing program allocates a fixed weekly budget, which can sometimes necessitate cuts to the reimbursements in order to avoid excess spending. Such cuts can only be known _after_ the weekly period has ended, and therefore the existence of a weekly budget renders any trade-time estimates useless. In contrast, here we propose a fixed total budget which is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. This allows us to add reimbursement estimates to the Exchange UI at the time of the trade. If there are still funds remaining in the budget, the user will see an estimate of the amount of BAL to be awarded; and if the budget is exhausted, then the user will simply be informed as such and the estimate will be zero. When the well runs dry, BAL governors can decide whether to replenish and continue the campaign.

Third, the BAL/ETH price model is modified. Whereas the ongoing campaign uses the median price for the whole weekly period, the proposed campaign uses the price as close as possible to the actual block time. Knowing the approximate price at the time of the trade allows us to make informed estimates about the amount of BAL to be awarded.

![image|690x120](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/e00a59183e29b37e29369999caccc6035028b810.png)

Finally, the fixed amounts of gas (130k, 220k, 300k, 400k) were chosen so that only 1% of all trades, on average, would be overcompensated. This should be sufficient to prevent gaming the system for profit, but nonetheless **we reserve the right to filter out suspicious activity**. The Balancer Exchange UI will never perform more than four swaps in a single trade, which is why only four numbers are provided; any transactions containing 5+ swaps must belong to bots, whereas the target audience is end users. We simply cap the reimbursement amount at 400,000 gas; any additional eligible swaps beyond the first four will yield no further benefit.

# Mechanics
Although every effort is made to be as transparent and accurate as possible, there is still a very small amount of room for error. Here we will detail how the BAL amounts are computed both at trade time (estimated) and at dispersal time (actual).

At the time of the trade:

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **estimated** gas price for display purposes is the median from the last few blocks according to the `getGasPrice()` function from the web3 provider. This should provide a good corollary to the median of the actual trade block, which cannot be known in advance.
4. The **estimated** BAL/ETH price for display purposes is queried from the large [80/20 BAL/WETH pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x59a19d8c652fa0284f44113d0ff9aba70bd46fb4/). This acts as a real-time oracle which isn’t worth manipulating because it is only used to display an estimate and not to compute an actual award amount.
5. The user will see, in one summary number, the final result of #1-4: the approximate amount of BAL to be awarded for this particular trade, assuming there are still funds left in the budget. A USD estimate is also provided for completeness, with the BAL/USD price being queried from CoinGecko’s API.

The UI changes are still being finalized, but as a mockup consider the image below.

![image2|485x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/balancer/original/1X/1174949f6ce920677d9102bbf6ee0a35627776b8.png)

At dispersal time (computed by the [open source mining scripts](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts)):

1. Determine the number of eligible swaps. An eligible swap is one leg of the overall trade in which both tokens are on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json).
2. The amount of gas to be reimbursed depends directly on the number of eligible swaps: 130,000 gas for one swap; 220,000 gas for two swaps; 300,000 gas for three swaps; and 400,000 gas for four or more swaps.
3. The **actual** gas price is the median from the block containing the trade. We will filter out artificially low-price transactions which are sometimes included by miners and can skew the median - these are typically 0-gwei or 1-gwei transactions.
4. The **actual** BAL/ETH price is queried from the CoinGecko API for the time closest to the block time of the trade.

It should be clear that the only possible sources of error between the estimate and the actual award are most likely quite small: the median gas price from the last few blocks may not perfectly match the median of the trade block, and the 80/20 BAL/WETH price may not perfectly match CoinGecko’s BAL/ETH price. All in all, the user should see a highly accurate estimate of the BAL award at trade time, and this improved user experience should bring more traders to the campaign.

## Summary

Introduce govFactor, an on-chain voting factor of 1.1 for Balancer Liquidity Providers.

If passed, the govFactor will initially be implemented as a 3 month trial with voter participation acting as the key success metric. 

## Background

🔥_ 🔥 ([FireEyesDAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao)) has been actively working with the Balancer team over the past few months in an effort to develop a robust suite of governance mechanisms to complement the upcoming launch of Balancer V2.

One of the issues we concluded on: consistent voter participation has historically been an issue for many DeFi protocols. Whether it results in proposals not reaching quorum or only having a small number of participants involved, it’s become obvious that protocols need to drive meaningful voter participation across a diverse group of users.

The govFactor creates a simple incentive mechanism for liquidity providers (LPs) to actively participate in governance. 

## Motivation

As it stands, Balancer liquidity mining encourages passive participation. Liquidity Providers (LPs) simply deposit capital into the protocol and earn BAL. Despite the significant subsidy LPs receive in the form of governance tokens, there’s no expectation or requirement that they actively participate in governance.

This ultimately represents a misalignment as LPs have no incentive to vote despite constantly accruing voting weight. If the suppliers are subsidized by the protocol with governance power, they should be willing stewards of the protocol as well.

This does not mean that LPs MUST participate, but instead **they should have an incentive to participate**. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to incentivize those that service the protocol to help govern it as well, aligning their participation with additional weighting to their weekly liquidity mining rewards. 

## Specification

The govFactor is an on-chain voting incentive for LPs that affects BAL liquidity mining allocations depending on whether or not an address voted on the last governance proposal. The implementation multiplies BAL amounts each LP gets by their govFactor (1.1 for those who voted, 1.0 for those who did not) and then normalizes all amounts so that the sum is still 145,000 BAL per week. 

The govFactor will operate as an “on/off” switch where LPs that voted on the most recent proposal by signing a transaction turn “on” the factor.

Providers that did not vote on the last proposal by signing a transaction have their govFactor “off”, forfeiting the factor and in turn, receive lower LP rewards than those that voted on the last proposal. This dynamic will remain “off” until the next on-chain proposal is open for voting and ratified on-chain.

If all LPs vote, then the rewards remain the same as if no one votes.

 **To make calculations as simple as possible, govFactor would be applied after all other factors.**

GovFactor looks at addresses who have voted on the most recent proposal featured on Snapshot and references to see if the address is also providing liquidity to the protocol. If both variables are met, the protocol includes a factor to their weekly BAL liquidity mining allocation.

It’s important to note that this reference happens entirely on-chain, meaning there’s no need to cross-link any addresses to a forum or public username.

Ultimately, the **govFactor creates a unified incentive for those that service the protocol to become active governance participants as well** and should be considered by the community as a simple mechanism for encouraging governance participation from the protocol's supply-side actors.  

## Drawbacks

Some points to consider surrounding the GovFactor:

* The end result could be a lot of non-engaged voting, coming from LPs who don't hold meaningful amounts of BAL (even if being large LPs) and who don't really care about Balancer governance, putting little to no effort in the decision process behind their votes.
* The GovFactor encourages LPs to vote through their liquidity mining address, which could pose some issues for opsec conscious users. However, Snapshot now enables delegation from cold wallets which would mitigate this issue. 
* The cadence between different governance proposals is likely to differ. This means that someone who votes on the last proposal preceding a large time gap to the next proposal may see increased liquidity rewards despite not actively participating in governance discussions.
* The state of Balancer Governance is relatively idle and therefore implementing a governance incentive isn’t currently necessary for the success of the protocol.",bullish,12.165,2020-12-15 22:22:27+00:00,14.165,14.165,2020-12-16 00:00:00+00:00,16.44060830250719,14.09,0.1582408549116318,0.9012685716152192,True," The text proposes introducing govFactor, an on-chain voting incentive for Balancer Liquidity Providers to actively participate in governance. This factor will be a multiplier of 1.1 for those who vote, encouraging participation without requiring it. The implementation is proposed as a 3-month trial with voter participation acting as the key success metric. The motivation behind this proposal is to align liquidity providers' interests with the protocol by incentivizing their governance involvement. The govFactor will operate based on whether or not an address voted on the last governance proposal, and rewards will be adjusted accordingly. The text also discusses potential drawbacks such as non-engaged voting from LPs who don't hold meaningful amounts of BAL or pose issues for opsec conscious users.",bullish,medium
1064,1916,5328,5328,5328,2021-08-26 21:06:00+00:00,balancer,"## Motivation
We’re now a few months into the V2 Liquidity Mining Program, and everyone’s been learning what’s good about it, as well as where improvements could be made to make the most of every BAL token we allocate. Since the launch, we’ve added a new Tier 4 (following a governance vote), and introduced liquidity mining rewards on Polygon. We’re quickly gaining traction on Polygon, and created a lot of excitement around Balancer, which has been awesome.

Over the coming weeks, there’s plans for launching on Arbitrum (although we need to be mindful of spreading liquidity mining rewards too thin + liquidity fragmentation), new pool deployments, and a number of dual incentive partnerships.

While all very positive and exciting, these plans create additional pressure on the limited number of liquidity mining slots we have, and it’s becoming difficult to envisage how everything will fit in without further changes to the tiers and slots. We also have some potential partnerships with smaller projects where weekly BAL rewards as low as 100-500 BAL per pool may make sense, which the committee doesn’t currently have the power to grant (the smallest we currently have available to us is a Tier 4 slot, at 1,000 BAL per week).

Dual incentive partnerships with smaller projects are very helpful for long term relationship building, securing liquidity for good projects which will grow over time & marketing to new users.

## Specification
If this proposal is approved, the Liquidity Mining Committee would be able to allocate a total of 10,000 BAL per week however it wants, outside of the tier system, to whichever networks & pools it decides make sense at the time, based on available opportunities.

This 10,000 BAL per week will be made available by removing 2xTier 2 slots, currently filled by USDC/WETH & USDT/WETH on Ethereum. There were already plans to deprecate these pools over time, as the Tier 1 WETH/DAI pool is planned to be replaced by a WETH/staBAL-3 pool when the batch relayer is ready.

This flexible BAL allocation will make it much easier for the committee to fine tune liquidity mining rewards, and phase pools in/out of rewards. For Polygon, Arbitrum, or any other network Balancer’s governance may decide to incentivise in the future, the committee will not be able to allocate more than the total BAL voted on by governance to that network across the new flexible BAL allocation and tiers. If flexible BAL is to be allocated to a network that would take it over its limit, a Tiered slot would need to be allocated back to Ethereum to keep it under.

As of the time of this proposal, a maximum of 25,000 BAL per week can be allocated to Polygon, and 25,000 BAL per week to Arbitrum. Governance may vote to change these limits in the future.

## Dependencies
None. The frontend liquidity mining script has already been updated to be more flexible, such that we could allocate any amount of BAL to any pool.

## Risk Assessment
We see no greater risk that Committee Members could “go rogue” and mis-manage rewards than they could with the current structure.

Governance would continue to have the power to halt the powers of the committee at any time, or remove members from the committee if it deemed such an action appropriate. The need for committee votes to pass changes each week would provide several days for governance to intervene, were such an intervention deemed necessary.",bullish,25.56,2021-08-26 21:06:00+00:00,27.45,27.45,2021-08-27 00:00:00+00:00,7.3943661971831,27.45,0.073943661971831,0.8556621670722961,True," The text discusses a proposal to expand the flexibility of liquidity mining rewards allocation by the Liquidity Mining Committee.

The new system will have a limit on the amount of BAL that can be allocated to each network, with current limits set at 25,000 BAL per week for Polygon and Arbitrum. The risk assessment suggests that the committee members' actions remain under governance control, and intervention is possible if necessary. Overall, the sentiment appears to be one of strategic planning and adaptability in response to growing demand and opportunities for liquidity mining.",bullish,small
1065,1917,5329,5329,5329,2021-01-22 16:49:59+00:00,balancer,"This proposal is also on [Balancer's Forum](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-sourcecred-engagement-incentives/684) but has undergone minor edits to include the results of forum polls.

🔥_ 🔥 ([Fire Eyes DAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao/hello-world-e3c9a409ea49)) has been working with the Balancer team to develop governance mechanisms that complement the launch of Balancer V2.

At the end of 2020, we proposed [Governance Mining](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-governance-mining/554) to encourage community members and liquidity providers to participate in governance, and to compensate these people for doing so.

One piece to this incentive program is the implementation of a [SourceCred instance](https://balancer-labs.github.io/balancer-cred/#/explorer) to track contributions to the Balancer Community.

**This proposal looks to leverage SourceCred to distribute 50 BAL per week based on the Cred and Grain scores accumulated by users across both the [Balancer Forum](https://forum.balancer.finance) and the #governance channel in the [Balancer Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7hWw6Us).**

Community members will need to opt-in to this program to be eligible for rewards, with specifics on the process to be finalized pending acceptance of this proposal.

# Motivation
The introduction of ‘soft’ incentives around governance in [Maker](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-sourcecred-trial/2551) and [Index Coop](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/the-index-flywheel/447) have improved the quantity, quality and diversity of contributions.

We aim to empower these contributions in the Balancer ecosystem via a suite of governance incentive programs. The [GovFactor](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-govfactor/589) addresses the incentivisation of liquidity provider participation, and we believe that there is a much broader space for participation in the Balancer community from people and groups who may not have the capital to become LPs, or who otherwise choose not to do so.

# Specification
The [Balancer SourceCred Instance](https://balancer-labs.github.io/balancer-cred/#/explorer) was set up in December 2020 and has been collecting contribution data for the past ~4 weeks.

We propose that BAL tokens are distributed to contributors based on the Cred scores recorded by SourceCred and the subsequent grain (or BAL) scores earned among active participants. For more on how this works, please see [this documentation](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/grain/).

The following specification details our proposed structure for these incentives. Inspiration for the allocations and configuration of this instance were modeled after the [MakerDAO SourceCred Trial](https://makerdao.sourcecred.io/#/explorer).

**Forum Incentives**
The Balancer governance forum is the home to the most important discussions and Balancer Improvement Proposals (BIPs).

This program looks to offer a fixed amount of BAL per month to those contributing in meaningful ways, measured using [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) to track aggregate likes, posts and engagement across all topics.

Balancer’s SourceCred instance is heavily weighted towards the amount of likes received across all posts, rather than the quantity of replies. This enforces a **‘quality over quantity’** approach, rewarding contributions that are deemed valuable by the community through engagement and signal.

**Discord Incentives**
We’ve noticed community members on Discord play an active role in educating new users as well as providing valuable feedback and discussion around protocol governance. Through this integration, we want to create mechanisms for those actions to be easily validated and rewarded.

The first instance of Discord incentives will track activity in the [#governance channel](https://discord.com/invite/7hWw6Us), rewarding participants for meaningful contributions in the same way as forum activity - focused on reactions as opposed to post volume to push towards a ‘quality over quantity approach’.

This program looks to serve as an ongoing medium for community members to be better rewarded for their discussion in Discord, with ambitions to boost the importance of BAL emojis and token-based roles using tools like [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/).

**Funding**
The proposed funding for SourceCred incentives is 50 BAL per week to start.

Please note that this program aims to ramp up in the event that it is successful, and we believe that starting with smaller allocations and building up as time goes on is the best way to approach these incentives.

**SourceCred has an opt-in revenue model of allocating 5% of all BAL tokens distributed through this program back to their community, and we are very much in favor of supporting this intiative.**

# Drawbacks

Three weeks ago, Balancer governors [voted to allow Gauntlet](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer/proposal/QmZZycpDWZYAzNho6uVaWL5nFpVzauc89HC9d5QNTSn18J) to set swap fees on pools deployed from the [WeightedPoolFactory](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8E9aa87E45e92bad84D5F8DD1bff34Fb92637dE9#code). At the time, this was the only Balancer V2 pool factory available; but since then, another specialization has been deployed for [two-token pools which provide TWAP oracles](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA5bf2ddF098bb0Ef6d120C98217dD6B141c74EE0#code). This proposal seeks to grant the same authorization to Gauntlet, but for the new pool factory.

## Motivation

Please consult the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-v2-authorize-gauntlet-network-to-set-swap-fees/1799) for the full details. In short, this authorization would apply **only to pools using the delegated owner** address (`0xBA1BA1ba1BA1bA1bA1Ba1BA1ba1BA1bA1ba1ba1B`). For those pools which have opted in, Gauntlet's power would extend **only to the swap fee**; Gauntlet cannot alter any other attributes of the pool nor extract funds.

## Specification

The Balancer Governance Multisig would submit one transaction as follows. Here, ""Multisig"" refers to the Gnosis Safe at `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` and ""Authorizer"" is the smart contract at [`0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6#code).

1. Grant [Gauntlet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE4a8ed6c1D8d048bD29A00946BFcf2DB10E7923B#code) the ability to set swap fees on pools deployed from the WeightedPool2TokensFactory

# The Proposal
The [exchange gas reimbursement pilot](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799) will come to a close at 00:00 UTC on February 22. This proposal seeks to extend the program another four weeks, to end at 00:00 UTC on March 22. We would continue to allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy. It should be noted that three days still remain in the pilot, but at present about 20,000 BAL would still remain from that initial budget, and those tokens should be used toward the 30,000 BAL budget for this extension. The remainder will be taken from the Balancer Ecosystem Fund.

# Motivation
The initial pilot has gone well. During its first 3.5 weeks, a total of 9332 BAL have been issued to 4568 recipients. Of these recipients, only 846 had held BAL before the start of the program, which indicates that distributing governance tokens to traders does indeed improve decentralization of voting power. This decentralization has always been one of the core goals of our liquidity mining program, but that program applies only to liquidity providers and not traders.

There has been some discussion on Discord about extending the program indefinitely, but first we need an opportunity to make refinements and collect more data to gauge the program's effect on core protocol metrics. Over the course of this four-week extension, we should be prepared to make structural modifications to the program (ratified by governance) to improve the user experience, which seems to be holding back many traders from participating. We should also, as a community, make a concerted effort to increase awareness of the program in order to grow the sample size of the data.

# Mechanics
The overarching mechanics of the gas reimbursement pilot would not change. Please see the [original proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-balancer-exchange-gas-reimbursement/705) for details. Also refer to the program's [expansion to all whitelisted tokens](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-expand-the-exchange-gas-reimbursement-to-all-whitelisted-tokens/799), which would remain in effect throughout this extended period.

Swaps between any two of the tokens on the [whitelist](https://github.com/balancer-labs/assets/blob/master/lists/eligible.json) would be eligible for reimbursement of gas costs, with limits described in the original post and summarized here:

* Only transactions between an EOA account and the Balancer Exchange Proxy would be eligible. This roughly correlates to end users navigating the [Balancer Exchange UI](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap) and would not include DEX aggregators or most arbitrage bots.
* The maximum amount of gas to be reimbursed would be 100,000 units per swap, where there can be more than one swap in a single transaction (a swap is one leg of a multi-hop trade).
* The maximum gas price (in gwei) used would be the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block.
* Reimbursements would be made in BAL, not ETH, with the median BAL/ETH price from CoinGecko for the weekly period being used to convert.
* If the number of tokens to be distributed in a single week exceeds the 7,500 BAL budget, all reimbursements would be scaled down proportionally so that exactly 7,500 BAL are issued in total. However, there is room for flexibility here: the amount issued through Week N should never exceed N*7500; but if previously unused tokens remain they can be utilized. For example, if only 1,000 BAL are spent in Week 1 but Week 2 requires 10,000 BAL, then 2,500 BAL will be taken from the Week 1 budget and put toward Week 2 so as not to unnecessarily restrict the distribution for that week.
* Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program and the gas reimbursement pilot. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.",bullish,44.19,2021-02-19 19:39:30+00:00,50.414,50.414,2021-02-20 00:00:00+00:00,14.084634532699711,45.918000000000006,0.039103869653768,0.852897584438324,True," The text discusses a proposal to extend the exchange gas reimbursement program by four weeks, aiming to improve decentralization of voting power and increase awareness of the program.

This is a follow-on proposal to this temperature check post [here](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-launch-bal-call-options-using-uma-protocol/1689).

I would like to proposal that Balancer add liqudiity to the BAL call options built on UMA. These calls are decentralized and permissionless, and secured by UMA's optimistic oracle. 

You can see the frontend they are already traded on at mysynths.finance 

There was over $10M in trading volume across the life of the token that expired April 31st ""out of the money.""

**The Proposal**
UMA has already used 7000 from our treasury to mint call options, plus about 500 more to LP. That gives us about $70k in liquidity in the pool. 

We would like to ask Balancer to match that 7500 by minting 7000 call options and pairing that with additional BAL tokens into the [Balancer pool here](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xd5675d073c17a9d22ebe0ebfe35b95ebe6e28a84/). 

At the current price of .0762 BAL per call, that would be 7000 minted calls + 0.0762*7000 = 533 BAL, for a total of 7533 BAL.

This would double the liquidity in the pool and give the Balancer community a chance to experiment with this product and gather data and build some experience. **The goal is to keep rolling this liquidity into next launches, as the market and BAL community has time to learn about this product and how it works.**

**Implementation & a note on IL**
The calls can be minted using a Gnosis safe in connection with wallet connect using the mysynth.finance UI. Then, they would simply need to be added to the pool to achieve this outcome.

The UMA team will commit to communicating with the Balancer team and advise them when to pull the liquidity - It is not advisable to let the liquidity remain in the pool too close to the expiry date as the options can expire valueless, and thus the IL would be punishing. 

**Other Information**
These are the current call options supported by other projects look like this:

BAL presently: $70K with 7500 BAL locked ($400k value locked)
UMA - $4.5M in liquidity with 900k $UMA locked ($22M valued locked)
UNI - $190k in liquidity with 32.5k UNI ($1.35M valued locked)

This proposal outlines a collaboration between the Balancer Protocol and 🔥 _ 🔥 ([Fire Eyes DAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao)) to act as a governance steward and strategic partner to the Balancer ecosystem in return for 4,200 BPT tokens vested over 18 months, including a 6 month cliff. 

## Background

Since November 2020, Fire Eyes has been actively engaging with Balancer governance and working with Balancer Labs to steward the Balancer V2 launch. You can [read about the work here](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao/x-balancer-4249df3f68c6?source=---------1-----------------------), but below are some highlights:

- [Assisted with the Balancer V2 Launch](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-v2-generalizing-amms-16343c4563ff) 
- [Established the V2 liquidity mining program](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer/proposal/QmeCrSe5xL5YWB17TjxAofYi3QnBMyHCYqufD8t3Zonj4S)

- [Adding BAL to Aave](https://app.aave.com/governance/3-QmRT8PiQwzPUYZVvURqYBDpb8M6EveRUwkMY4uoTJXNmMm)

🔥_ 🔥 has always been focused on working alongside communities and projects that we believe are capable of achieving new heights of innovation in token and governance primitives. 

This is something we see in Balancer and why we're excited to present this proposal to the Balancer community outlining a continued scope of work.


## Key Areas 

🔥_ 🔥 [Fire Eyes DAO](https://medium.com/fire-eyes-dao/hello-world-e3c9a409ea49) will engage with the Balancer community, the Ballers, and Balancer Labs in recurring meetings to develop new governance and token frameworks. This collaboration will be focused on: 

* **BAL Tokenomics**
    * Work with the community to finalize and implement a strategy for the BAL token to expand beyond governance, including potential ways for value capture and benefits for LPs.
*  **Acting as Balancer Protocol Politicians**
    * Develop new governance proposals and lead discussions on improving the Balancer protocol, and generating value for the ecosystem. 
    * Propose BAL and BPT token integrations into other DeFi protocols
* **Partnerships**
    * Help onboard new partners for Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools, Balancer Smart Pools, and other protocol-unique applications like Aave Safety Modules. 
* **Balancer Market Position & Narrative**
    * Continue to develop the narrative of Balancer v2, asset managers, and protocol-unique applications.

These key areas will be worked on with 🔥_ 🔥 and the Balancer community through bi-weekly workshops, forum posts, Discord activity & governance proposals.

## Timeline

This proposal outlines a general timeline of **6 months** and a commitment from 🔥_ 🔥 to support Balancer as a protocol politician beyond the initial scope.

## Terms

🔥_ 🔥 is proposing to be compensated exclusively in BAL tokens vested in accordance with grants larger than 1,000 BAL. This allocation will come from the Ecosystem Fund.  Following community discussions, we've reduced the initial allocation and increased the vesting period to further align ourselves with community expectations. 

* **Grant Request: 4,200 BAL in BPT tokens, vested over 18 months with a 6 month cliff.**   

Fire Eyes will utilize this allocation to actively participate in Balancer governance and for liquidity on Balancer V2.

As outlined in the [new whitelisting process](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217), this is a proposal to increase the AMPL capFactor from cap1 to cap2 ($1M -> $3M).

**The Proposal**

This is a proposal to increase the AMPL cap tier from cap1 to cap2. AMPL currently has ~$3.4M in liquidity, well above the $1M level.

Ampleforth has developed a Smart Pool that updates weights each day with supply changes to reduce impermanent loss normally incurred by LPs on other decentralized exchange platforms. This AMPL/USDC pool currently has $6.5M of liquidity.

**What is AMPL?**
Ampleforth is a digital currency with an elastic supply that adjusts each day according to demand in the marketplace. The protocol effectively seeks to shift volatility from price to supply. The supply can shift dramatically over time, while the price stays within a band around the price target of the 2019 US Dollar.",bullish,14.908,2020-11-25 23:51:48+00:00,15.735,15.735,2020-11-26 00:00:00+00:00,5.547357123691969,13.382,-0.1023611483767103,0.8252556025981903,True," This text discusses a proposal to increase the capFactor of AMPL (Ampleforth) from cap1 to cap2, which would allow it to hold up to $3M in liquidity instead of the current $1M.

## Summary

LongHash Ventures proposes a program for BAL/WETH LP token (“BPT” throughout this proposal) holders to stake their BPT for different periods of time in order to get economic benefits, such as boosting their Liquidity Mining rewards, and governance benefits, such as having the ability to vote on proposals. This staking feature is beneficial for the Balancer protocol as it rewards BAL holders who take a long-term view through staking of their BPT, while still ensuring BAL is not sitting idly staked but within a BAL pool.

For the purpose of focusing on the staking and governance mechanisms, this document will only propose staking of BPT from the BAL/WETH pool. In the future, proposals can be made to include BPTs from other BAL pools. Additionally, this proposal will only propose staking on L1. Staking on L2s such as Polygon should be addressed in a separate proposal.

## Background

LongHash Ventures is a Web 3 investment fund and accelerator actively collaborating with founders to navigate the crypto landscape in Asia and build their Web 3 model. In January 2021, we launched a DeFi-focused fund and invested in projects such as Balancer. We also invited Balancer to join our Asia DeFi Network initiative, as part of which we worked together with Balancer Labs over the course of 12 weeks through our venture building program to support them with the development of a decentralized governance model, liquidity mining for Balancer V2, and community building in China. We wrote this proposal as a follow on to the work we did on governance as a natural first step and enabler towards a decentralized governance model.

Governance token staking has been adopted by DeFi protocols, such as Uniswap and Curve. It is a way to provide an incentive mechanism for token holders to actively participate in the governance of the protocol. It is also beneficial for the protocol as it rewards BAL holders that take a long-term view, and incentivizes them to actively participate in the governance and future development of the protocol.

As the governance of Balancer begins to shift from Balancer Labs to a more decentralized model that is led by the community, staking of BPT from the BAL/WETH pool can act as a mechanism to incentivize token holders to actively participate in the governance of the protocol.

We have taken inspiration from the staking model of Curve, Idle Finance, and Pickle Finance for this proposal.

## Proposal

We propose a staking program and mechanism for the BPT of the BAL/WETH pool to have economic and governance benefits, as part of a broader effort to formalize the decentralized governance framework that will govern the Balancer protocol.

## Economic benefits of staking BPT

### Boosting of BAL rewards for Liquidity Mining

In Balancer V2, Liquidity Providers can earn BAL tokens from the liquidity provided into specific pools eligible, based on their proportional share of liquidity of those pools.

Liquidity Providers could stake BPT from the BAL/WETH pool to boost their Liquidity Mining rewards, based on the period of time the tokens are staked for. For example, Liquidity Mining rewards could be boosted by X (multiplier) if BPT tokens are staked for Y (time period). Note that this staking mechanism does not change or impact the amount of weekly BAL allocated to the pool, but rather changes the proportion of the allocation of those BAL rewards to the LPs depending on their share of the pool and whether they have staked their BPT and the duration of staking.

## Governance benefits of staking BPT

### Voting on proposals

As Balancer embarks on a journey towards decentralization of how the protocol is run, a key enabler of this will be for the ability of BPT holders to vote on proposals. Staking of BPT would allow addresses that staked to vote on Balancer protocol governance proposals as long as the BPT remains staked/locked.

## Features of BPT staking

BPT token holders would have the option to stake their BPT into a smart contract and lock it in for a period of between 1 month and up to 4 years, in monthly increments, e.g. 1 month, 2 months, …, and 48 months. The UI/UX would be intuitive for less experienced users, for example with a “slider” feature with monthly increments, from 1 month to 48 months, that can also show the LP what the rewards booster is for each lock up period.

In return, BPT token holders who stake their BPT receive vBPT, a token that enables them to claim economic and governance benefits outlined above. Those who stake BPT would receive vBPT on a 1:1 basis regardless of the locking period. The boost to liquidity mining rewards depending on the locking period is outlined in the table below: SEE FORUM POST

Note that BPT holders who stake their BPT will not be able to withdraw BAL from the BAL/WETH pool for the staking period of BPT, e.g. if a BPT holder stakes BPT for 12 months, they will not be able to withdraw BAL or WETH from the BAL/WETH pool for 12 months.

The formula for rewards boosting would work, conceptually, as follows:

[LP’s share of pool] x [Multiplier] / [Sumproduct of LP’s share of pool and multiplier] = [Share of BAL rewards]

## Conclusion

This proposal for a staking mechanism to give economic and governance benefits to BAL holders can be a benefit for Balancer on two fronts:

-It provides a rewards mechanism for BAL holders who take the long-term view
-It is a starting point for Balancer to shift to a decentralized governance model

We think it is best to start with the features outlined above for the staking mechanism. In the future, additional features or modifications / scope can be proposed and added to it, such as:

-Staking BPT from BAL pools other than BAL/WETH
-Distribution of protocol fees to vBPT holders
-Vote boosting feature to provide additional voting power to BPT holders who stake for longer periods of time
-Staking mechanism for L2s",bullish,32.34,2021-09-02 18:46:30+00:00,34.58,34.58,2021-09-03 00:00:00+00:00,6.9264069264069095,33.245000000000005,0.0279839208410637,0.8867043554782867,True," The text proposes a staking program for BAL/WETH LP tokens (BPT) to provide economic and governance benefits.

1072,1932,5354,5354,5354,2021-01-22 16:55:48+00:00,balancer,"# The Proposal
For a **pilot of four weeks** starting at **00:00 UTC on Monday, January 25**, with possible extension until the launch of Balancer v2, we would allocate up to **7,500 BAL** each week to the **reimbursement of gas costs for swaps** performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy.

# Motivation
We understand that gas costs and usability issues in Balancer v1 have been a bit of a hindrance for many users. Balancer v2 is on the way and set to improve this situation immensely, but in the meantime we have recently launched the new and improved exchange UI and would be thrilled to invite users to give it a try without incurring undue personal cost.

# Mechanics 
Similar to the current liquidity mining claims process, where calculations are run once for each weekly period and claims are made available via a MerkleRedeem contract. The script used for computing the reimbursements would live off chain, along with the liquidity mining scripts, and it would be fully open source and auditable by anyone.
 
**Eligible transactions**: transactions made from externally owned accounts _directly to_ the Balancer Exchange Proxy (contract address: 0x3E66B66Fd1d0b02fDa6C811Da9E0547970DB2f21). The goal is to target traders who are using the Balancer Exchange UI. We would use _""EOA interacts with Exchange Proxy directly""_ as a heuristic to determine that the trade comes from a user of the Balancer Exchange UI. This should prevent most on-chain arbitrage bots from benefiting from the program, as most make their trades via proprietary smart contracts.

**Eligible swaps**: swaps between two of the following tokens:
* WETH (0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2)
* WBTC (0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599)
* USDC (0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48)
* DAI (0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F)
* BAL (0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D)

The token list may be expanded following evaluation of the initial pilot.

It is important to distinguish between a _swap_ and a _transaction_ and to note that a transaction through the Balancer Exchange Proxy can contain a number of swaps; a swap is simply one leg of an exchange transaction. For example, a transaction that routes BAL->WETH->DAI contains two eligible swaps: BAL->WETH and WETH->DAI. Similarly, a transaction that routes ineligible token XYZ through XYZ->WETH->DAI contains only one eligible swap: WETH->DAI, and a direct swap of XYZ->WETH is wholly ineligible. Finally, a transaction that routes a BAL->WETH trade through *two* BAL-ETH pools contains *two* swaps.

The gas reimbursement would be the lowest of either:
1. the total gas effectively used by the transaction; or
2. 100,000 (one hundred thousand) times the number of eligible swaps in the transaction

The gas price used for reimbursing each transaction would be the lowest of either:
1. the gas price of the transaction itself; or
2. the median price of all transactions within the enclosing block

It follows that any transaction totaling less than 100,000 gas per eligible swap and utilizing a gas price less than or equal to the block's median would be fully reimbursed, while others partially reimbursed.

Reimbursements would be made in BAL, while gas is priced in terms of ETH, so a conversion is required. The price oracle would be CoinGecko's API, with the median BAL/ETH price from the week being used for all of that week's reimbursements.

Claims would be made available via the same MerkleRedeem contract currently used in the liquidity mining program. Reimbursements and liquidity mining proceeds for the week would be summed and be claimable in a single transaction.

For this pilot, we would set aside 7,500 BAL tokens per week for four weeks. Tokens would be provided by the Balancer Ecosystem Fund. This is a weekly cap for this pilot, so it will not necessarily be fully used. Data from the week of January 4 shows that about 1,500 BAL would have sufficed for reimbursements, so a 5x overhead of 7,500 BAL would be budgeted to account for an influx of transactions and possible swings in the Ethereum gas price. This program would affect neither the ongoing Liquidity Mining campaign nor Batch #2 of the Ecosystem Fund Grants, as both draw from pots that have already been separately allocated. In case more than 7,500 BAL are needed in a given week, reimbursements will be reduced proportionally.",bullish,19.95,2021-01-22 16:55:48+00:00,21.403,21.403,2021-01-23 00:00:00+00:00,7.283208020050121,21.8285,0.0941604010025062,0.8717949390411377,True," The text proposes a four-week pilot starting January 25th, offering up to 7,500 BAL per week for gas cost reimbursement of swaps performed through the Balancer Exchange Proxy. This initiative aims to improve usability by reducing costs for users during the transition to Balancer v2. The program is designed to target traders using the Balancer Exchange UI, with eligible transactions and swaps meeting specific criteria. The gas reimbursement will be based on the lowest of either the total gas used or 100,000 times the number of eligible swaps in a transaction. Claims would be made available via a MerkleRedeem contract, similar to the current liquidity mining process. This pilot is funded by the Balancer Ecosystem Fund and will not impact ongoing Liquidity Mining or Ecosystem Fund Grants. The goal is to incentivize users to try the new exchange UI without incurring undue personal cost during the transition period.",bullish,small
